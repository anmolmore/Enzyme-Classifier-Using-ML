"2208232","Classy Tamil Food in a cozy place.Â  You have variants in Dosa, Kothu Parotha and even in beverages here. With limited space capacity, you might need to wait for others to clear up before you can sate your taste buds with sumptuous Tamil Delicacies here.
Jigar Thanda, Nanari and Mojitos are always on repeat along with Mutton curry and Dosa.",5,"2019-03-17 22:49:27",95,550,0

"48591821","Real TN style (Madurai style more specifically) food.
The kari and chicken kari are very good. The ceylon parotta, egg veechu and most of the dishes here are good.
They also serve TN style biriyani made off samba rice.
Mutton chukka is very tasty here.
The place has limited seating and might take a while to serve ordered food some times. But the food is really good.",4,"2018-06-22 15:53:50",2,3,0

I like veg thali in which they serve two curries, dal, sambar, chuttnies, ghee, chapattis, rice with reasonable price. Also i like chicken samba biryani, omlet, Nannari sharbat. I recommend to all to go to this hotel. ",5,"2018-06-08 18:53:12",4,19,0

"1773167","To all Tamilnadu food lovers in Hyderabad here is your place where you can taste amazing Tamil food from breakfast to lunch to dinner... after a constant look out for Tamilnadu food finally found one... their dinner menu is amazing from dosa to parotta, their lunch menu with variety combo... briyani tasted well with authentic chicken-65, their mutton chukka was amazing.. parotta was crisp and tasted well with veg... to top it all their Nanari is the killer... place might be small but the people running it have bigger hearts.... must go place for Tamil food lovers!!!",4,"2018-05-31 16:31:05",18,52,0
"99665","Small Joint which serves good home style food and finally something Madras/Madurai style food.. Finding the place was little tricky but Google map helped.. Went during lunch hours ordered mutton chuka biryani.. Biryani was on the spicy side a little but mutton chuka was soft/juicy without a single piece of bone and finally chicken 65 like how it has to be fried n crispy.
Finishing with a proper nannari.. Very cost-effective n looking forward to try their breakfast pongal n evening parota menu. ",5,"2018-05-24 22:13:40",6,4,0
"1461009","I found this place by accident. It brought back memorIes of my stay in Madurai.
The food is simple but delicious, devoid of unnecessary spices. Had the Madurai Paratha with chicken 65 and an omelette. Couldn't find anything to complain about.
I'll definitely return at the earliest.
Thank you for the great meal.",4,"2018-05-21 21:27:26",10,5,0

"395709","amazing food. the place is a typical small madurai parotta stall setup. We tried the mutton jeera samba biriyani which had the authentic small mutton chunks. the raitha is again madurai style - long chops of onion dipped in salted curd. the chicken meals was average. the chicken 65 was brilliant - mild masala and crispy like no other chicken 65 you get in town. We were initially hesitant to order fish cos it was a Friday and there's good chance it could be a refrigerated catch from Sunday. but we decided to risk it and it turned out to be great! absolutely fresh and delicious with no stench of fish. the omlette looked appeasing but we were left with no space to fill. we finished our meal with the signature Nannari Sharbat which was perfect! would definitely visit again.
