"16174233","Sooo... It's a sports bar. On the side of a busy road , so easily accessible. Very lit... Bright.. a bit too bright for my taste though.
I went on a special day , so there was a live music band playing. But it was too loud. So the brightness and the loud music didn't do justice to so much as setting the mood.
Food was ok, taste wise. But price was on the higher side. Limited variety of food. But they have done some nice experiments with the wings. So , try worthy.
But there are very nice people working there. Very friendly, Nice staff. Service was very good.
Along with that, if the ambiance would be set for proper occasion, then what a hit a road side sports bar would be..!!
Hope to visit again soon.. to a nice ambience üòä",3,"2019-04-29 00:21:48",47,143,0

Pros:
1. Spacious place, big screen, perfect for watching match/football in group over beer.
2. Many virtual games to keep the visitor entertained
3. Perfect for large game fan groups, bachelor weekend parties etc.
4. Decent wings but definitely not a selling point.
Cons:
1. Not ideal for couples, ladies and people looking to have a calm & cozy ambience
2. Food is super expensive, and the biggest disappointment are burgers - tasteless, no seasoning on patty, no seasoning on fries, you just have to reply to the sauce for some flavour.
3. On anyday, hands-down, not worth the price.",3,"2019-04-10 00:31:39",40,32,3
