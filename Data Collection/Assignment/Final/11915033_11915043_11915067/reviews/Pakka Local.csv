"36036126","Nice place to go and have nice South Indian food.
The ambience is good.
Starters and drinks were great.
Its reasonable in cost, we were some 11 people for 7 k bill.
Servers were polite and nice.",4,"2019-05-15 18:15:09",16,68,0
"16432369","This was my first time visiting pakka local. The place looks nice and service was ok. However, food was too spicy and after eating the food I can feel the burning in my belly. Food was good but it was beyond the level of spice which any one can bare.",2,"2019-05-14 16:25:10",2,3,0

"2317944","This filmy themed restaurant has my heart‚ù§Ô∏è!
After visiting kondapur branch many times this time we happened to land at Gachibowli branch. OMG! This place was hell occupied and it was least expected. After having a prior booking on a weekday it took us twenty minutes to get a table.
Pakka local is damn Affordable, Lipsmacking and Hospitable which is a rarity in current scenario.
üç¢Veg baskets were delicious as usual. Crispy coconut paneer was presented very beautifully but tasted bland. Felt like eating raw paneer by dipping in chutney.
üçΩÔ∏èPanner Kali March was perfectly cooked to creamy consistency with lots of veggies. The peppery flavour definitely added a new definition and combined with stuffed kulcha this dish tasted heavenly.
üçöSambar rice topped with ghee and cashew nuts was mouth watering. With lots of tender veggies sambar rice was a perfect end to our meal.
This mad rush made the service staff go haywire and were least attentive to our order requests. Every order took an eternity to arrive on multiple reminders. Pakka local is known for their hospitality but this time they disappointed us.",4,"2019-05-08 08:22:05",81,869,6
"80010518","Items are as same the name. I like the flavour of spices in biryani. Names of biryani were also seem funny. Chitti mutyala chicken pulao and guntur mirchi biryani and deserts must try ",5,"2019-05-07 13:32:34",7,5,0
"30260723","I have been here twice. This place is definitely for those who want to try pakka local delicacies :D Here goes my crisp review.
Ambiance:¬†
Ok. This is typically crowded even during weekdays n dinner. But I didn't have to wait in either of my visits.
Food:
Too many varieties to bring out the taste of the south I must say. We tried the miryala rasam soup (amazing it was), pappu annam(Yummy), mirchi rice(different), the pellivari bhojanam(Ok, it is a mixture thali to satisfy the north n the south it had biryani, naan and pappu, rasam sambar etc., so personally did not like the choice of items in the thali).
Starters:
Too oily. Even the complimentary papads that we get are too oily.¬† Not happy with the deep friend dishes even the french fries are soooooooo oily.
Service:
Good. The lady was very good at suggesting the dishes and explaining what each is. I
Cost:
For those who want to try south indian dishes this is definitely a good place hence the cost is ok. For others, it may look pricey.
Overall.. a good place and I'm positive I shall visit again.",4,"2019-05-06 12:15:10",15,33,0
"29614243","The service was very very slow. Almost the whole restaurant was complaining about the service. There were so many people to serve but not one was taking proper care of any table.

"32534966","Went for a casual dine out for dinner. Ambience was good but the tables are small. Live ipl match and the waiters dress code was the same. Tried the konaseema masam vepudu as a starter which was spicy tasted good and Guntur Mitch biryani was spicy and lip smacking.
Pocket friendly and service was okay but not quick.",4,"2019-05-01 12:10:33",19,20,1
"894969","We went to this place on Holiday for dinner looking at high ratings on Zomato. Overall ambience was good but nothing outstanding and tables were too small for 4 people.
We went for tomato soup along with veg kheema balls. Soup was good but kheema balls were ordinary. We ordered Chettinad veg curry and Tawa paneer in main course along with Lachha paratha, phulka and masala kulcha. Both curries were highly disappointing. No richness and just spices. Masala kulcha was full of masala. Taste and quality of food is below par.
Overall experience in terms of Food, service and ambience was disappointing. Not recommended unless you run out of all options. May be better only from pricing standpoint.",2,"2019-04-28 21:43:11",209,4085,5

Must try : Ginger egg, panner kurkure, Shirley temple( we have only tried veg items). They have also given sweet pan(too good) at the end. We have tried crispy corn but it's very okaish.

"43721891","Visited Pakka Local along with my colleagues. Wonderful ambience. Liked the seating arrangements. I liked the design of the menu. Its filmy style. Tried out Veg Manchow soup and Veg Basket. Both were awesome. For main course gone with the Big Boss biryani. When checked with the waiter he said that biryani is combination of chicken and Mutton kheema. Once we recieved the order, rice taste is good as chicken kheema was mixed with it. But the mutton balls are up to the mark. It was full of flour. When checked with waiter there was no proper response. The service is bit slow. Other wise it's an 5 star.",4,"2019-03-31 11:46:44",8,20,1
"8267981","The name Pakka Local is inspired from a song in the famous Telugu movie 'Janata Garage'. It is located in Indra Nagar, Gachibowli beside HP petrol bunk. The ambience inside the restaurant gives the feel of a film studio as the interior walls are filled completely with film posters.
Food:
Not just the ambience, some the dishes in the menu which are under the Pakka Local specialities are after the film names.
Starters that we tried here:
1. Kaju Kodi Roast
2. Dragon Chicken
3. Mangolian Chicken
4. Crispy Coconut Chicken
5. Spicy Mini Veg Basket and a few more veg starters.
Of all the starters that we have tried here, crispy coconut chicken was really toothsome. It is served along with mayonnaise and this was the best combination to have this starters. Rest of all the starters from this restaurant are equally good.
In main course we tried the signature dish of this restaurant, Baahubali Biryani. This comes with a combination of 4 biryanis (Chicken Biryani + Mutton Biryani + Prawns Biryani + Fish Biryani). It can be easily served for 5 - 7 adults. All the 4 biryanis are equally delicious. Along with this we ordered Mirchi Bhojanam, Panner Biryani, Butter Naan and Kaju Paneer curry. Of these Mirchi Bhojanam was bit spicy and comes with garnished cashew and green chilli.
Service:
The only disappointing aspect in this restaurant is the service. The service was soo slow that you will loose the interest in the food by the time the order reaches your table. This should be addressed altleast by increasing the staff relatively with the demand over the weekends.
Value for money:
Pakka local is a pura Paisa Vasool. You will feel every penny of your money is worthy. Visit this restaurant and do try out the Coconut Chicken and Baahubali biryani. Have good food and a great day :)",4,"2019-03-26 21:31:18",64,540,9
"11717301","The ambience is good, food is tasty with quantity being alright. I liked the food service, very polite. The mocktails were all bad , taste like too much syrup added. Better avoid the mocktails. No buffet available.",4,"2019-03-24 13:13:36",14,23,0
"2764592","Ordered curd rice, rumali roti, mutton dum Biryani and chicken Biryani.
Since i liked the curd rice much, ordered mutton dum Biryani 2nd time. Then even mutton dum Biryani too made me feel good. Ofcourse it is not in the lines of authentic hyd biryani but again it is not totally bland. Pieces comes with bone & tasted good and good in number. The rice masala is not like authentic Biryani but averagely okay. In one line you can try mdb for once.
Coming to chicken Biryani, i didn't like it. Rice masala is bland and the pieces are all boneless. Personally i do not like boneless pieces. So I'm disappointed with CB.
To management:
The packing is of course having standards but please try other options because i could not use the the 2 liquids given along with Biryani just because the cover is too tight to open and demanding to be very very careful to open to avoid splits. ",4,"2019-03-16 22:48:58",7,29,0

Looking at the name we thought it would be an authentic place for Telangana and Andhra food and looking at the menu made the feeling more realistic. I won't talk about the starters but I want to talk about the main course dish we have ordered. We have ordered Natu Kodi Pulusu. For people who knew this dish it is one of the famous dish in both the states and there is a special style of preparing it which makes it more authentic. What we got was a curry which tastes similar to butter chicken with country chicken pieces added to it.Don't spoil the authenticity of some dishes. I love cooking and I accept that it is your dish and made it in your style but when you keep a name ""pakka local"" it should resemble with your dishes too. ",2,"2019-01-05 00:58:11",2,7,0

The manager Mr Baadal is really a great host. He called in the head chef who suggested us the specials. It was really great. Attaching some of the food pictures, see for yourself. Pakka local really blew us away.
Cost of food is also right on point. Not at all overpriced for the experience you get. Give Pakka Local Gachibowli a try! You won't regret it. #awesome",5,"2018-12-08 23:11:06",6,7,3
"34586502","Been to this place first time on 30th november with in a week it dragged me thrice to this place. The menu has a regional touch and is quiet innovative and makes u to experiment flavours. When it comes to the food I'm completely bowled. Each dish has its own distinct flavour n aroma of the food tempts your hungry soul to have more. Tried so far Bahubali Biryani, Aha na pellanta Thalli, Gadwal kodi pulav, Kothimeera kodi pulav all the dishes are extremely finger licking. Today up on chef's suggestion tried chilli Garlic pomfret, spicy mini veg basket they turned out extremely good. The staff here are quite courteous n Chef Ashish himself comes personally at each table and inquiries about the food. They are actually ready for prompt suggestions. The ambience of the place is another thing which makes u go again n again. Happy tummy happy me",5,"2018-12-07 00:12:04",7,8,8
