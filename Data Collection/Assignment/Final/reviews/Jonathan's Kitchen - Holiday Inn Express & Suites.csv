"6087451","This one's simple. They have great food, be it whichever cuisine. Especially the starters and my favorite Thai curry. However, they could work on the service. I have been here multiple times. One time we kept waiting for a waiter and nobody was willing to turn up and the other time we got there at 10 pm, and they were trying to get us out the minute we entered, by insisting it will be last order, would we prefer takeaway, so on so forth and this is when they were serving quite a good number of tables.
Full marks on food, none on service. Ambience is that of a typical restaurant in a fancy hotel (you know what I mean).",4,"2019-05-18 23:58:10",15,20,0
"35192681","Worst experience with this hotel. Food taste was very bad. No attention from servers. We even doesn't know that there are rotis and icecream. No one bothered to serve. Only peanuts was good among all the food. But for peanuts 1000 bugs is too much. And most special thing is a tile from wall fell down where a customer missed it in a inch. Plz don't sit at the last.",1,"2019-05-15 16:47:28",1,2,0

"32728257","Went to this amazing place quite sometime back. It's a very pretty, romantic place for a fine dining experience.
Great food, service and hospitality. They had live music elate the already beautiful and well lit ambience! I'd suggest a dinner at this place with your close ones! Better to reserve a table in advance.
Lovely taste in food. Delicious mushroom soup and the Quattro Formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth! Loved the appetizers and desserts as well.
Must try: Forest mushroom soup, Crispy corn pepper salt, Quattro Formaggi, Tiramisu
Would actually give it a 4.5/5",4,"2019-05-14 14:45:52",52,123,0

"38377826","Visited with family for dinner on a special occasion.
The valet parking was a relief.
Unfortunately there was no maitre'd and we had to seat ourselves.
The ambience was great - I loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening.
The food was really good. The sushi (even the veg variant) was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb.
Service however was lacking on all parameters. It was cold and inefficient. It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did, they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out (couple of women in particular - could not catch their names). The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time.
The food here is great, but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3. Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant.
Will we return? Perhaps not in the near future - the only reason we would return at some point would be Zomato Gold on the food.",3,"2019-05-01 15:06:57",13,11,0
"262224","Been to this place twice-once with friends and ordered ala carte and other with collegues for a buffet- loved both the experiences. The food here is really good.Unlike others, I will start with the dessert-love their creme brule the best and followed by their baked cheesecakes..Have tried their chickn burgers, pizzas and thai cuisine as well--i loved the burgers the best, followed by Thai curry..Buffet was less impressive than ala carte but was happy with the variety-whic included Hyderabadi cuisine apart form meditteranean...must place to visit in Hydereabad.",4,"2019-04-30 22:30:39",113,1569,0
"33199510","Went for lunch with friends...ala carte. Liked the ambience,though it was really far to get to!! We had the Caesar salad, which was fresh and could have used a bit more seasoning; Pizza arabiata-really nice, crust thin and ingredients fresh and tasty! Penne pasta-chicken was also good, though the chicken seemed dry. The best dish was Thai green curry vegetables which was served with a jasmine rice-the best ever flavours-a must try!! Now coming to the desserts- we had the philadelphia cheese cake baked-nice plating but cheesecake can be improved significantly. Creme brule was good--loved the crispy carmelized sugar crust.
There was a lot of crowd and it took us a long time to get our orders. Overall it was a nice experience, hope to have a better one next time.",3,"2019-04-30 18:09:47",101,1518,0
"34243275","I think there is no point of taking a buffet here. I took a buffet for the purpose of having mutton curry; but it was spoilt. Hence, there was no benefit from paying 2000 for 2 people.
I took this plate like this. I left this plate like this. ",1,"2019-04-27 23:02:39",9,8,1

Jonathan kitchen had been on my check list for quite some time.. I was very happy when we finally went over a weekend for the buffet.. 
The early impressions were not great as it seemed very crowded and the ambiance wasnt bright which aroused a non positive vibe.. As we dint want to Go to another restaurant at that time.. We proceeded to have the buffet.. 
Except for the desserts section which was huge, I was disappointed with the overall quality of the food.. The taste want great and at the same time, the meat had a lot of bones.. service was bad.. There was always a shortage of plates and the dessert spoon they gave me was the highlight of the whole  experience.. 🤣",2,"2019-04-24 01:17:29",200,389,3

The spread is wonderful and quite enjoyable for vegetarians. I loved the pizza and some of the continental starters.
The main course options were also wonderfully flavorful.
And the desert spread also had more than a dozen options.
Not for the weight watchers :) ",5,"2019-04-20 13:22:35",24,15,0

We ordered a pizza and risotto, pizza was great lots of veggies and nice crispy crust. Risotto was nice and had good texture, not an expert on risotto but liked it overall.
Quality of service is really good though very few people know details about the menu like which dishes are recommended etc.

"1211323","Heard a lot about this place and many suggested that it’s a must try. I finally tried this and it was a LIT. They have a very interesting a la carte menu with food from different cuisines.
The ambiance good and pretty much similar to any fine dining restaurant except wobbling chairs.
I found service quite quick and clean. Food was brought to table right on time. The quantity of the dishes served did justice to the term value for money.
Everything I tried were perfectly done and delivered.
Chicken Peking Style, Peri Peri Chicken breast, Fish and Chips, Crispy Veg Uramaki (Sushi).",4,"2019-04-17 18:23:42",21,36,3
"47894683","I was invited to this place by one of my friends to have a dinner and experience the hospitality that Jonathan's kitchen provide.
Let me talk about the ambience , the place is very well designed and Maintained. The lighting at the place is very warm and cosy. perfect place to have a romantic outing as well as family time.
Now coming to food , for the starters we ordered tiger prawns , butter garlic prawns , mutton sikampuri kebab, crispy corn.
Out of all the butter garlic prawns were the highlight. I'd go back to this place just for butter garlic prawns.
For the main course we ordered beef steak and rice and dal tadka, though I am not a fan of beef and I don't eat , my friends told that it was too good. Dal tadka was awesome.
Overall this is a perfect place to have dinner and lunch , I'd definately recommend this.",5,"2019-04-16 10:47:16",74,97,14

"34515229","A decent place overall. It has a nice ambience though it can get pretty crowded and noisy during peak hours. The menu is pretty wide-ranged. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a Pasta in main course. Appetizers were not very good. Chilli broccoli was too oily. However the Pasta was really good. ",4,"2019-04-11 17:39:24",6,7,0
"52357067","My steak experience here was a lovely one. Though I asked for medium rare done steak I was served a well done chunk of chewey meat that I didn't appreciate. The sides however were perfectly made and impressed me all on their own. The light and brightly lit interiors with white flowy curtains that never allow harsh sunlight to make eye contact make this place lovely for a laid back brunch. The eatery has an aura of tranquility that you simply cannot deny. ",4,"2019-04-11 03:42:14",48,19,0
"2280096","I have heard lot about the place but finally tonight I managed to visit it. They have an interesting and a wide range of a la carte menu and thats what we all were hoping to try out. 
The ambiance is similar as of any fine dining restaurant.
I heard reviews about their service being a bit slower, but luckily I did not experience that tonight (might be due to the lesser rush on a weekday night), rather I found the service quite good.
The quantity of the dishes served did justice to the term value for money.
Recommendations: 
Blackened salmon steak
Rib eye steak (one of the very few places in Hyderabad where they served an actual medium rare steak!!)
Sirloin steak
Cilantro fish
Jumbalaya
Cheese cake with blue berry compote",4,"2019-04-10 00:14:09",74,266,8

"873715","I have visited Jonathan's kitchen on many occasions. One thing that strikes me is for such a big restaurant, their service is not so nice. Also, they denied us Zomato gold services saying we were sitting in Komatose, however as per their front staff, they told us to sit in Komatose as they didn't have seat in Jonathan's kitchen but the food, menu and staff will all be from Jonathan's. Hence we sat and ordered and later, found out, no gold accepted.
I have tried their buffet, ala cart, Sushi and everything else, Nothing extraordinary. The only benefit is, it is close to my place. ",3,"2019-04-06 22:36:33",40,32,0

Still no questions asked on why we're leaving. I guess one can plan a visit if they have a lot of time in their hands and or are not hungry.

"1383151","Did not enjoy our evening at all. Just realised not to order Sushi if it's not an authentic Japanese restaurant. Nigiri and uramaki were rice and rice and rice.. I made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take. Waiters were very transactional. Told them it's my daughter's birthday and asked for a cake. They had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. We'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up? Cos this is a 3-4 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous. Service was very slow.. overall a lousy experience. ",2,"2019-04-03 22:19:18",36,138,0

They served so many MOCKTAILS like
ORANGE DELIGHT had amazing blend of vit C to give u the boost in this hot weather
CUCUMBER n MINT very refreshing to beat the heat n taste was good too
VIRGIN PINA COLADA not good as it had coconut n pineapple flavor n I'm not a fan of coconut flavor especially in drinks,so it was a No No for me
BLACK CURRANT tasted good
SPICY TANGO had a tinge of masala like jaljeera n a dash of spiciness dat had a pinching sensation on the throat.....little different n can be taken
BLUE LAGOON as the name says it's a blue colored drink dat had blue caracao syrup added with few lemon wedges n mint leaves.....tasted realllllyyy good
FOOD
GRILLED POMFRET
a big fat good looking pomfret😋 marinated with an awsome blend of very basic n flavorful spices n grilled to perfection....served with mint yogurt dip along with onion rings n lemon wedges.......fish was full of flavors with each bite giving superb taste n it was fresh as the taste of fish meat was very good n not at all smelly......well presented n delicious👌
CHILLI CHICKEN
Chunks of boneless chicken coated with batter n fried till golden brown,tossed in a chilli soy based sauce with onion,cubed capsicum,dry red chillies n spring onion stalks topped with handful of cashews n raw cabbage.....overall tasted very good n chicken was perfectly cooked n the sauce that was coating it was fab too...

Crunchy corn topped with some garlic n onions is the best of anything that one could possibly desire for........ if you love crispy corn then u you cannot miss this.....it was a fantastic appetizer to start our meal with.......do not miss this guyzz 👍
THAI BASIL CHICKEN WINGS
When chicken wings are coated in a delicious schezwan style thai chilli garlic sauce with a touch of basil leaves u get an awsome result.....it was very different kinda wings which we don't usually get at other places.......delicious
CHICKEN WONTON
Minced chicken filling wrapped in wonton sheets served with sweet chilli dip......filling had a quite dominant flavor of vinegar otherwise it was fine.....
NAWABI SHIKAMPURI KEBAB
Usually shikampur is flat round shape n filled with yogurt,but here it was in a round ball shape filled with yogurt n onion dip.....shikampur was cooked very well n was going very well with the mint sahi chutney n onions on the side...
DRAGON PRAWNS
Crispy fried prawns tossed in red chili n garlic sauce
BUTTER GARLIC PRAWNS
By far one of the best butter garlic prawns I had till now.....crispy fried prawns tossed in a velvety buttery n garlicky sauce with onions n spring onion stalks topped with sesame seeds n raw cabbage......👌
TIGER PRAWNS
Jumbo is also a small word to describe the size of these prawns....whoa mahn!!!!
Tiger prawns was the right name given to this dish as the prawns sized huge....tossed in a very basic garlic,salt n pepper sauce served on a bed of blanched spinach topped with lemon wedge.....it was a bit hard but other than that the flavors were good
DAL TADKA
Well blended with perfect tempering of dry red chillies,chopped garlic,cumin seeds n oil.....was one of my favorite from the main course items.....delicious
RARA GOSHT
Minced meat gravy dat was delicious n spices did not overpower the whole dish which was the best part of this dish
BUTTER NAAN n AMRISTSARI KULCHA tasted yummmmm
BURNT FRIED RICE WITH SCHEZWAN CHICKEN GRAVY

"29793146","I love the food here they have a great spread for their buffet. However I have never had the buffet so I wouldn’t comment on the taste, but the spread is definitely good cz I checked that out. I come here and order right out of the menu and over time have fallen in love with their Fish items from the grill section. I have had the Blackened salmon steak, Cilantro Fish and the Murrel Crust and have loved each one. However, if I had to pick one it would be the Salmon and that too would win by a very close margin. Apart from their fish I love their Spring Chicken and Chicken Confit as well. If you love grilled meat that is cooked delicately in continental cooking style, then this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit.
Coming to the ambiance, it’s minimalistic and chic. The staff is polite and warm. They have a Zomato gold offer on food, so that’s amazing because the food is a little on the pricier side. I definitely plan to have their buffet soon and will update this post accordingly.",5,"2019-03-28 14:30:59",21,58,2
"50231866","I have been there for quite a few time now, for brunch, Ala cart as well as only for dessert.
Brunch- They do have a hell variety of items and I am sure you won't be able to taste them all...I liked their starters very much which had egg options, pan cakes, sautee vegetables, idly, dosa and many more.It was fulfilling in itself.If you also love brunch than it is definitely worth trying and value for money.
Dessert- I went their only for dessert once and had Tiramisu and chocolate ganache...both of them tasted amazing...except Tiramisu base was little watery after sometime but still it managed to satisfy my craving.

"69970310","Best place Ever Jonathan's Kitchen
If you are near Gachibowli and are planning to have a perfect lunch or dinner so I recommend you the best place is Jonathan's kitchen, where you can visit with your family and friends. I really loved this place from it’s ambiance to food and service, everything’s top notch.
It was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.
Grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn’t much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo’s before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!
Then my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.
Then we ordered some mocktails because it’s mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.
Then it’s time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.
But without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.
Thanks to Mr. Rashid for the lovely dinner at Jonathan's kitchen. Thanks to the entire team of Jonathan's kitchen who served us in a very good way and special thanks to Surrender and Chef vijay.

Huge disappointment this one was.Been here for lunch on holiday,even though i made a reservation before hand it took 30 min for us to get a table.Service, i always let go even if the service is not uptothemark cause it's understandable and afterall they are human.This one was unacceptable.It was a buffet(everything selfservice) only thing they are supposed to do was provide cutlery which they failed even after asking for multiple times.I walked upto the cutlery table to get it myself and they gave me 2 spoons and one plastic spoon for a table of 6.😂The taste of the food in the buffet,total off.Below average spread and taste.Nothing caught my attention to even write about it.The kebabs were all dry,the classic crispy corn was rock hard .The fish curry,i think they accidentally put fish in the salt gravy.Why is it so hyped,i still don't get it.May be i visited this on restaurent's bad day.But it was a bad lunch day for me and my friends.We just know how to have fun in the crisis,good for us,otherwise you can land up in a huge disappointment.",2,"2019-03-24 14:34:15",84,635,0
"33916626","One of Hyderabad's most stylish fine dining places, Jonathan's Kitchen serves lip-smacking culinary delights paired up with a cool and extensive bar menu. The luxurious ambiance and enchanting music make this place an ensemble of various occasions. I was here for a Tuesday night dinner with some friends and we experienced a flavorful time.
We started off with some amazing starters; Butter Garlic Prawns, Grilled Pomfret, Dragon Prawns, Crispy Corn Pepper Salt, Chicken Wonton and Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab. The Prawns were just fabulous, they were a perfect start to our dinner. Grilled Pomfret was also very good. Crispy Corn were the best that I've ever had, they've topped my last best opinion. Chicken Wonton had a perfect crisp covering and the filling was really great. Lastly, the Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab were very juicy and succulent.
Next we had some of the finest mocktails; Orange delight, Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada, Black currant, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. All of these were very refreshing and perfect to have before moving onto the main course, while still enjoying the appetizers. Although Virgin Pina Colada wasn't that great, and Orange Delight the best.
We had an array of dishes from the main course, starting off with the ambrosial Chateaubriand, tenderloin cooked medium rare and served with creamy spinach and mushroom cream. It is a high end dish, and it did keep it's name.
Then we savored Rara Gosht and Dal Tadka curries with Butter Naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Both curries were absolutely delectable and were a divine treat to our taste buds. Lastly, we had Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. This was an absolute favourite of all, a tempting and toothsome Chinese dish with succulent chicken crispy on the outside juicy inside, slathered with a hot sweet uniquely spicy and sticky Indo Chinese schezwan sauce that just made our night.
We ended our dinner with the most sumptuous desserts; a classic Gulab Jamun, a fruity Creme Brulee, and a luscious Chocolate Fondant Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. A perfect end to an amazing dinner. We had a wonderful time here and are just waiting to visit again.",5,"2019-03-22 15:03:01",57,1122,8

There was a lady I said ur servicing was very worst and smiled in sarcastic way and went off. They will replace items after 20min. We have to wait for that item. Even bowls for sweets they will bring after half an hour that too not more than 5. At last I feed up with the services and had thought to have sweet and I find an Cockroache in the bowl I called the lady and waiter they did not responded. Then I went to kitchen and called a person ranjith he took the bowl and went inside the kitchen and came back and said sorry and offered 5 Ice creams. We were around 30 people. And he saying to come in the evng or next day. I don't know what they think about the customers. Basically it looks like decent and star hotel but the people and the service just like irani cafe. At least in cafe if we order they will get it fast or else inform us if it late. I heard lot about Jonathan kitchen food is absolutely good.

"34073096","Writing this review for so called much hyped restaurant of Hyderabad- Jonathan's kitchen
Went to celebrate my bday today..It was the worst food buffet I ever had in any above average costly restaurant.They charge so high for this shitty buffet.
1. Ambience- Even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall. No theme no decoration
2. Service- No serving of starters, no serving of even water until u ask,no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here.
3. Food- The worst part of it..Some stale starters of chicken and fish. Veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old.One chicken starter only had some taste. Main course is also pretty below average.Pasta is good.Pizza(so called best Hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.
Deserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.
Two juices as welcome drinks were Ok.
I gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.Thanks for that.
They themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la carte..Will do that if I will ever try to take this risk again😜",2,"2019-03-13 21:45:14",11,3,0

I ordered dragon prawns , which was as nice as it could that I thought of ordering again. My friends ordered soup, which is the most hateful thing by me in food. The prawns were really soft, crunchy and tasty. The vegetables onions, bell peppers were all tasted good due to harmony between the sauces used to cook the prawns. As main course we ordered salmon steak which was really the size of a steak with vegetables and creamy sauce. I, like usual , ordered Indian cuisine which was butter naan and chicken tikka masala which was really suffice for me. The taste was also good.

Dahi ke Kababs were very nice and soft like they should be. Thai Basil Prawns were also nice and tasty. They were properly cooked and well served. Fresh lime soda was.....well fresh lime soda but Strawberry Mocktail was super sweet and is a must try. Penne Arrabiata pasta is one dish that I would recommend you all to try here. The gravy was super thick and delicious, the pasta was boiled perfectly and the presentation was also good.

Quality of Food: 5/5 Simply premium.Items I like the most are veg. maki (sushi), broccoli salad* from their regular menu.But even more outstanding are their live counter options such as Tawa Fish (Not your regular bland bone-less fish, but the way you eat fish at home) had some real flavour. Omelette, French toast, Pancakes were simply brilliant.
Variety of Food: 5/5 Enormous.This is where Jonathan's Kitchen truly excels, there has to be at least one item you will madly fall in love with. They claim to have over 60 items on their menu, which can be verified rather immediately upon looking at the serving table.
#In the name of unlimited drinks, there was no real variety to choose from. I couldn't even get my favourite soft drink Thums up (Franchise issue probably, I know), and on that particular day, there wasn't any option of Pina Colada.

"1587011","I went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Four of us were there for lunch, out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for à la carte. I was among the two who went for à la carte. For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band. The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded, they offer open air seating as well. The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor. Personally, I felt the seating isn't much comfortable as the chairs' backrest lacked comfort. The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn't as comfortable as I expected it to be. However, the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can.
Coming to the food, I had ordered Mutton Sukha, Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns. My companions went for the sunday brunch, as they told me the non-vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless. All the starters were very well balanced in flavour, the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite. Compared to the starters, the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing. Prawn cocktail was outstanding, the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet. Coming to the à la carte menu, the Mutton Sukha was great in every way, the spices were perfectly balanced they weren't overpowering the flavour of the meat, it's definitely a must try there. The rib eye steak didn't impress me much, the meat wasn't juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing. On the other hand, the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant, they were served on a bed of sautéd spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour.
Overall, it's a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world. ",4,"2019-03-01 20:11:54",17,399,2

"487840","This review has been long overdue, I visited this place for my birthday and gawd I wasn’t disappointed at all !! The place has this really sophisticated minimal design which isn’t too catchy but kinda looks like an elite ball room dining room. 
The service is just amazing ! Every staff member that approaches the table knows the menu in and out, the warmth that they have just gives this place extra points. 
Now coming to the main aspect of this restaurant; the food. The food is as authentic as it can get and this goes for every cuisine that the restaurant offers be it Mediterranean or Italian as a matter of fact even Indian.
Now I don’t want to go into detail with all that I ordered and describe it, I’ll attach images with this review and I’ll let the images talk for themselves albeit I’d like to describe a few dishes because those dishes deserve credit- to begin with I’d like to talk about the pizza, this was one of the finest pizzas I’ve ever had in Hyderabad, drizzled with a tad bit of olive oil and perfectly seasoned. 
Moving forward I’d like to talk about the mutabak, the chef had taken pedantic efforts to make this dish as authentic as it could get, I’d have to give him brownie points for his painstaking ability to make this dish, the omelet was perfectly cooked and not crisp like the replicas of mutabak that are available in other so called Mediterranean restaurants. The carbonara was  perfectly cooked, in the Italian way, the black pepper that stuck on each piece of pasta just showed how well versed the chef was with this recipe.
To summarize this I’d say yes this place is a must visit and I’d definitely recommend it for any formal or casual occasion be it birthdays or cooperate dinners, this place is the place to be !!",5,"2019-02-17 13:02:35",104,5123,4

"15719328","This was one of those places on my list that I have been wanting to try for the longest time that I can remember. I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi (Veg) in this place. I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available. In any case, I ordered a stater (shanghai rolls) which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself & wife and a pizza for my daughter. The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto (my fav place for asian cuisine). The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city. I also tried their creme brulee (best of the lot) which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping. In my opinion, they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself. I would have rated it 3.5 but for their really slow service (and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings). 
All in all, an average place to try out. I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu.

Ice-cream not available. I have asked there but the guy told me there is no ice-cream available. I got to know from my colleague that they serve ice cream on demand. This is wired.
Thank You for your service.",4,"2019-01-10 17:22:42",12,20,6

Went for Grill and Chill on Saturday night... Not a fun experience by any stretch of the imagination....
Ambience - it's ok... Nothing spectacular... Chairs weren't very comfortable and unsuitable for a relaxed dining experience...
Service - this is the truly sad part. Really slow service and servers are uninterested. This really hurt the experience and is unacceptable from a star property.
Food - starters were 4 varieties of chicken, 2 varieties of fish and 1 prawns.... The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka was nice... But unfortunately everything was served cold.... You ask for hot starters and you get cold starter's again...
Main course had lamb korma which was the best thing for the evening... Chicken curry was decent... Desserts were ok as well...
Overall, the buffet was extremely unimaginative and below average. Barbecue nation does a much better job!
The best part - they gave tissues instead of regular napkin ... And plastic spoons for dessert!! Pathetic!!!
VFM - Rs. 3000 for 3 people... And you get paper napkins and plastic spoons for dessert... I'm glad they didn't give us paper plates lol

"15962386","A quick dinner for last Sunday of 2018 landed us in Jonathan's kitchen. We ordered red Thai curry with rice for main course and Fish soy chilli for starter.
Fish soy chilli was spot-on, specially for a wintry night. Thai curry was tasty however rice quantity was quite less for the curry accompanying it.
Ambience is quite good with Oriental decoration",4,"2019-01-02 17:20:46",74,210,1
"3034642","After hearing from friends, we planned to visit this place on a Sunday.
Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.
Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.
Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)
Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(
Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.
Value for money - 3.5/5
Washrooms - 2/5.
Location - Easy to find, Valet parking available.
Used Zomato Gold here.",2,"2018-12-31 19:51:56",9,10,0

Ambiance is pretty amazing so is the live music of here. But the food is not as great as you expect from such restaurants.Desserts are good and there is also a quite descent range in it.",3,"2018-12-31 00:14:01",179,1874,5
"8169781","We went here for an afternoon buffet. The place was a little crowded because of an office party. Buffet spread is good. The food is tasty. We enjoyed the soup, paneer, veg balls, dhal makani, Veg biriyani. Dessert has variety and quite good. We enjoyed the food. Ala Carte seemed to take time. The table next to us was occupied the same time as us but were served when we were on desserts.",4,"2018-12-28 21:21:43",61,1188,1
"31939625","It was on my birthday I visted this place.
Ambience, service and location of this place is spot on..
Choice of menu is less and am sure they are clear about their strengths and they have curated the menu accordingly. Right balance of Indian, Chinese, etc
We ordered a Chicken starter which is very flavourful from the first bite and meat is juicy, succulent and fresh.
Chicken noodles is very subtle and at the same time very tasty.. Noodles looked freshly boiled and the veggies are as fresh as they can be.. :D You won't get this kind of flavour and taste to the noodles at many places.
Tried sushi for the first time.. It was served with a green pickle which is super spicy (a pinch of it can actually make you cry) and pickled ginger.. felt sushi is not made for my palate.. :D forgot to mention had hard time to eat with chopsticks.. finally had with fork and spoon.. LOL..
We ordered 2 mocktails as well which were not there in the menu, suggested by waiter.. both of them tasted good.. :) waiters could have been more attentive other than that no complaints..
Overall it was a nice dinner on an occasion of birthday..",5,"2018-12-27 22:27:44",7,475,4
