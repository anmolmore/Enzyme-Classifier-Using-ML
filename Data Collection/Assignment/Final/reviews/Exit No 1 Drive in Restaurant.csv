"108671615","It's a great place and very convenient to Ring road. The place was very nice and cool to sit there and eat in the evening. The food was awesome with multiple varieties of food as choice. And this place is perfect to go with family and kids so that every one can enjoy with food for everyone's choice. The service was also good and can be improved. Wish to see some fun activities for kids as there is lot of open space. It would be a great place for birthday or having special events.",5,"2019-04-25 23:36:15",1,1,1
