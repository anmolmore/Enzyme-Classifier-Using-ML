But Tandoori paneer wich is a bluff!! The wich had raw panner slices. Paneer was not cooked in tandoor so had no tandoori flavour.",2,"2019-03-17 10:35:52",29,15,0

"873715","I had ordered home delivery so my review is just based on food.
I ordered a corporate meal and the combo contained the following:
1. Spinach and cheese sandwich - 3.5/5
It was not that filling nor the taste of spinach was there. The good thing was it was soft and who doesn't love cheese?
2. Creamy bread - 2/5
It is nothing but butter toasted brown bread in condensed milk. It is okay, nothing exceptional.
3. Drink - Paper Boat (jaljeera) - nothing Rating for that.
It is a good place for quick bite and definitely pocket friendly",3,"2018-11-17 09:17:50",40,32,0

I ordered the Pocket Friendly Combo(INR 99) that included a mayo and masala wich. Thanks to Zomato for the complimentary creamy wich part of my treats subscription. The Sanswiches arrived grilled hot individually boxed with a dipping and tomato sauce sachets. The packaging was cool and the food was delicious! I couldn't get enough of that Mayo sandwich --  a true hero! The masals wich was just about okay with regular aloo filling and was somewhat spicy. 
Overall this could be your best choice if you're looking for a light and great meal!",4,"2018-10-30 10:06:40",37,313,0

"34490550","I order frequently from this place. Their sandwiches are tasty and light. The packaging is quite neat. My favorites from the lot are Cheese Masala wich and Cheese veggie wich. The stuffing is good - not too spicy and the sandwiches are properly grilled. I have always had good delivery experience barring one time when I ordered chocolate grilled wich - it was nothing but bread soaked in an excessively sweet chocolate syrup. But that was just one time. Never had any complaints thereafter. Their creamy toast is also particularly likeable, could be a good evening snack combined with home-made tea/coffee.

What I ordered - Italian pasta wich
Cost - 105rs
Ratings - food packaging was nice. Quantity was decent. Stuffing pasta/macrons was a bit less for the price but it tasted yummy though. They have attached a yummy chutney with that. Overall a 3.5/5 * for me. ",4,"2018-09-11 22:12:02",23,330,1

Have ordered through Foodpanda for my evening cravings and I must tell you, it's a delight!
Ordered Italian pasta Sandwich and the taste is exactly the way I would have wanted.

Just one thing I found out about zomato. For this particular place, zomato online order menu rates are somewhat different. Plain veg wich should have been 40/- but in menu it is 60/- which is cheese wich price. Also on another delivery app the prices are correct. So can’t say that these prices are just for online order. Though Zomato gives lot of coupons and offers this discrepancy is found for many restaurants. Not cool.. ",4,"2018-07-20 17:55:14",19,628,1

It is a delivery only eatery joint.
Ordered a Special paneer club sandwich as it had three layers of bread covered with paneer and veggies to fulfill my hunger at that point of time.
Upon checking the size of the sandwich received, I was disappointed. You can verify from the picture.
The sandwich tasted okayish and there was nothing special to spend 150+ 5(for brown bread) again. And it had lots of garlic paste in it alongwith green chutney.
