"35346373","It's has been a long while for a wine and dine.. And thanks to my now wifey we picked to have an evening at Link - Sheraton, Gachibowli.. We first enquired and were well informed and also were offered for a table to be booked. We reserved one for us. Upon entry we were well greeted by the manager (so sorry I forgot your nameü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and we're alloted a place of our comfort.. We were then introduced to Deepak who was very well mannered and to the best of his hotel management skills, etiquettes and politeness that I have ever seen or witnessed in the past 13 years of me in Hyderabad visiting not just 5 stars but other renound places too.. Prices were very decent and apt compared to a lot of 5 stars or even well known places to give a run for their money.. Happy hours was excellent..with good selection, a very wonderful evening spent.. I would like to see more of this place.. Keep it up crew!! Thanks Deepak once again üòä",5,"2019-04-24 20:50:12",3,24,3
"243632","I'm a huge burger fan - I just love a good burger. Had heard a lot about the Marriott Burger served at the Sheraton Hyderabad hotel's all day coffee shop Link Caf√© in the Financial District.
Today, coincidentally, was in that area for a meeting which finished at lunchtime. Went straight to Link Caf√© only to be told that they've discontinued that burger, but they were nice enough to recreate the same for me. And here it is - beef patty, bacon, melted cheese, the works. Best part - they served the lettuce and tomatoes on the side. And the sesame-iest bun ever.
Did it live up to it's billing as the best burger in Hyderabad ? Not quite. Not today at least. The beef patty was just a little drier than I'd have liked. But it is a good burger, undoubtedly. Quite filling and hearty.",3,"2019-04-04 10:51:11",19,39,2

"547469","My go to place when I want to unwind from the ISB chaos. The food is good, the ambience is amazing. But the service is ALWAYS sub standard in the cafe. Even though I generally go late night still I expect some basic standards of service. But the no. Of servers are less, they don‚Äôt generally follow up after the order is placed, and are least bothered. I hope the service is improved because otherwise its a good place. Also mosquito is a problem. They need to work on it too!!",3,"2019-03-11 18:07:45",20,38,0

"32072614","We have been to Sheraton multiple times after our shift log off time(5 AM) for mainly booze. The best part is they serve alcohol 24*7 but the disadvantage in the morning is limited food choices and it seems to be but pricey. The ambience is really good but the service is very slow and few good items are really good especially prawns and kuthu paratha. ",4,"2019-02-27 12:47:30",34,52,0
"52642708","Update: Changing my review to 5*, thanks to the chef and managers at Sheraton. The same biriyani is now available on demand, and I've hogged to my heart's content!
----
Sheraton, why would change something that was perfect? My friends and I frequent Link especially if we're hungry and crave for your Lamb Biriyani. Not only have you changed it from boneless to not-boneless, it is now mostly bones (27th Feb '19, around 1am). It's killed the taste too, and we left without even finishing it.
You have a wonderful and polite team. But they can only do so much if you change the food we love, to something that we cannot even eat completely - I'll come back only if our fav dish is back to how it should be.",5,"2019-02-27 05:00:35",4,1,0

We also ordered a chicken and mushroom risotto, which was very yummy. It was cheesy and had lots of chicken and mushroom.
Coming to the service, it was really really slow. A salad and risotto look about 30 mins for our table. Although there weren't many guests at the restaurant (only 3 at the same time), we had a hard time trying to get the attention of the staff.

The food served was up to the mark but the cutlery was soiled which was changed on informing the server. But, such things are not expected at such good places.",4,"2018-04-15 18:00:06",53,272,0

"14976","Heard there was a Pizza fest going on here. Came all hungry for lunch, gave order quickly for one pizza. After 10 mins the embarrassed order-taker comes back and says, sir Pizza will take a long time as we have only 1 oven. WTH. You keep a pizza fest, and you don‚Äôt make proper arrangements. Such downgraded service, stop calling yourself a 5-star already.
Pizza when it finally came after around 40 mins the taste was pretty bad. It was stuffed with ... wait for it ... green capsicum, ruining whatever taste it could have. Description said pesto would be stuffed. But it was served on the side. So lot of misses. Please stay away from this place.

"723573","In simple words :- Impeccable Service+ Live Music= Link. 
Dropped in to Sheraton hotel on 7th around 18:30 while waiting for a friend of mine at the lobby. Went to one of their outlets called Link to grab a drink. So I ordered for a Kf pint in the meanwhile. Got genuinely surprised when the server Vishal informed me that there was a Happy Hour going on and that I would be getting another drink as per the 1+1 offer...! That was neat... üëç 
Grabbed another seat for my friend and once he came, we ended up taking 4 rounds more. While drinking the live music was going on and that's when the singer played the riffs of one of the greatest songs written ever- ""Stairway To Heaven"" by Led Zeppelin and we immediately got hooked on to it. This is when we met Lokanath, the outlet manager who suggested to us that we could even give songs on request for the singer. Ended up sitting at the bar till 8 in the evening, bade my friend goodbye and left with beautiful memories and new friends. 
All in all, worth the 5 ratings. ",5,"2018-02-10 15:23:29",9,74,0

LINK Sheraton is a 24X7 coffee shop in the lobby that offers quick wine and dine options. Business activities and quick fast food is available all round the clock. Thank you",4,"2018-02-08 10:36:24",46,38,0
"45163686","Well we searched in the net that there is a 50 percent off the pastries in link on the weekdays so we ended up going there ,so being a complete vegan the only option that I had over there was blackforest pastry whose presentation was good but the taste was petty average 
Pricing after giving discount was Rs 75/- which is completely worth it especially in the 5 star hotel like sheraton
I cut one marks because half for not having much of eggless option and secondly another half for taste being average and not very good 
But a must try place for people who eat eggs as they have vast variety of option for them",4,"2018-02-01 00:26:12",172,1184,0
