"390963","Only packing was nice as packing charge was extra. Quality and quantity were not upto the mark. Ordered Poori via Ubereats some days ago. Not at all happy with the taste, not worth the money spent. 3 pieces of small and thick pooris were under fried, saagu was stale. At 57/-, this was unjustified",1,"2018-04-07 21:17:28",114,530,1

"1081213","Such a irritable experience this has been. The food was delivered almost past an hour and fifteen minutes. After such a delay it wasn’t even worth the wait and the taste was bland. I’d say do not order any food from this restaurant or from zomato. The service is pathetic. ",1,"2018-04-03 11:39:38",9,48,0

"34645699","Its really a good choice to go near to Divysree orion IT park, tasty and hygienic food compare to other food stall available round by. 
Must try chole bature, Paneer butter masala and paratha, and paneer dosa. Fan of their chole bature. 
We can get fresh and tasty idly and dosa there if its pretty late in office...
Taste wish its a good choice to go. ",5,"2017-11-29 22:28:41",25,60,0
