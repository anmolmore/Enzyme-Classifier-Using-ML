We have been there yesterday. This place has volleyball court n few others.
Ambiance is fine. Do have outdoor n indoor sitting.
We have ordered couple of mocktails n chocolate frosty. All the items are good. I personally like Green apple Mojito.item
Staff is not well trained and they need more staff to cover the crowd.
