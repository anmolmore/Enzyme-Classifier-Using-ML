"27725380","Ordered palak paneer combo and butter paneer combo and review is on that basis
Quality- food was good but palak paneer was very salty and I see many people have complaint about salt in there reviews but may management do not read reviews so never worked on that part
Quanity- Quantity was good, by ordering one combo and few extra rotis 2 people can have lunch/dinner
Value for money-4/5
Packaging- Fine not very bad not very good
Delivery-5/5",3,"2019-04-16 19:58:58",59,40,3

"2348534","Exactly how the rating is, the food was horrible! Just a suggestion, please don't try this place. Sick food. I had food poisoning after eating the food. It's full of oil, uncooked chapati's, extremely spicy. The amount of oil you put is insane. Please don't serve food at this price in case you can't maimtain your quality. I was sick for 3-4 days because of your food.
I don't know why zomato has even listed such outlets. Attaching some pictures for everyone's reference, and before the management of the restaurant marks it as spam. ",1,"2019-04-01 00:27:26",27,25,0
