"895038","Chakh De Punjab is a place where you can have your daily dinner. Great food at very reasonable price. The list of items I love here is long, Kababs, Sarso Ka Saag and Makke Ki Roti, Lassi, Paranthe, Bhurji Pav, Ludhiana Chicken. The man behind the kitchen Mr. Sandeep is someone you should talk to while ordering and he will definitely make the food as per you palate.",5,"2019-04-27 15:22:43",400,2709,0

"32884839","Ordered Paneer Makhani thali from here. Packaging was pathetic. Gravy was leaking from the plate and it was all over the polybag it was being carried in. Gulab jamun was immersed in the sea of gravy too and it took me a while to realize that it was actually Gulab jamun and not the usual Paneer Makhani. There was Aloo Matar sabzi as well which was semi-cooked. The only relief was rice and chapati which were fortunate enough to survive this chaos.",1,"2019-04-10 23:45:33",7,2,0

"51862628","Wasn't happy with the starters I ordered. One was chicken spring rolls which were greasy and were as if stuff was rolled up in a poori (that big)
Other item was chilly chicken which was decent enough but meat wasn't soft as it is supposed to be.

Ordered a Garlic Butter Cheese Nan, a Butter Roti and Egg Masala at 2:30 AM, called the restaurant with a special request. Everything obliged with a pleasant reply. Perfectly fresh and tasty food delivered on time. Can't ask for more. Thank you Chakhh De Punjab, Thank you Mr Sandeep Singh Sabharwal for the courteous response, Thank you Zomato and finally Thank you Mr Sriram for the delivery.

"16198800","Ordered from this restaurant after seeing the reviews and was utterly disappointed. Prices are too high which is not justified by food quality and taste. ",2,"2019-03-23 17:30:24",9,19,0
"33858701","2 stars are also more. Food was very bad. No taste at all. Achari veg was all filled only beans.
Kaju masala was very bad. Missi roti and lachcha paratha was half cooked. I wish I would have ordered from a tiffin center then ordering from this place.",2,"2019-03-22 20:31:15",15,2,0
"42215912","Did not expect the quality and taste to be honest. This was the second time we ordered something from here. On the first occasion we needed to fill yourself in a hurry, so we ate whatever we got and did not realize the taste as we were too hungry to do so. Today we ordered dal tadka and chicken butter masala (boneless). At last got something that tasted something similar to what we used to get in Delhi. I guess post this the taste is understood.",5,"2019-03-17 22:50:33",2,1,0
"100234261","I had ordered Paneer Butter Masala costing me Rs 276 after delivery charges and taxes.I was very dissapointed to see the quantity delivered for this amount.I have been ordering from other restaurants through Swiggy in the past and always the quantity delivered was more than expected.I think this restaurant needs to work on the size of portion it is offering or else reduce the cost.",2,"2019-03-13 21:49:05",1,3,0

"16493749","Chakhh De Punjab
So I ordered a Chicken Kadai combo and as you can see the Gulab Jasmin is missing and neither did I get lemon with onion. So I am deducting 1 star for missing order and another star as I got two small chicken pieces. Not at all a value for money for spending over INR 250. Taste was good.",3,"2019-01-26 16:34:41",100,213,5

"2926780","Went to have lunch alone, actually I searched for some other restaurant in Zomato and the address in Google maps seems to be wrong and hence randomly entered this place.Â 
Ordered Acharai panner thali, trust me this is one of the best curry I've ever had of this type, the gravy was very unique, thick, tasty and quality of panner is also good. Other dishes were pretty okayish compared to main dish.",4,"2018-12-12 18:41:45",79,161,1

Jeera rice - Fresh, tasty, well cooked.
Dal tadka - flavoursome, sahi maatra mei tadka.
Achari veg - not oily, greasy or coloured. Tasty indulgence.
Ajwain Lachcha Paratha - smokin hot, filling and complementing the curry beautifully.

"33503433","Very pocket friendly which will be a good change for the North Indians. It's not the best or anything but it's okayish as per the prices.
Service- Everything came on time. No qualms here. The delivery guy seemed to be a bit confused with the order and location. 3/5
Packaging/Presentation- Very well packed in a Thali type plastic container. 5/5
Food- I ordered the Paneer Makhani Combo and it was definitely Paisa Vasool. Following is my experience-:
Paneer Makhani Combo- Had 2 tawa rotis which I expected to be sturdier and crispier but they were similar to home made rotis. The paneer Makhani had ample paneer in it but was slightly more salty than what I wanted. The aloo sabji was the typical home made and yum. Dal was again home made and nice. The peas pulao was okayish. Aloo tikkis were yum. Raita was ordinary. Gulab jamun was good. Overall the Thali was a Paisa Vasool one but wasn't extraordinary in any sense. Go for this when on a low budget. 3.5/5
Will I order from here again? I would order when I am broke and on a low budget. ",3,"2018-08-13 15:21:29",316,1157,0

"60385124","Recently my north indian friends visited to Hyderabad and demand me to take a dinner in any Punjabi restaurant. Looks like dhaba. This cheap restaurant on my office way. I thought this is a good restaurant and they like food here. Very very very bad experience. I thought Punjabi test. I ordered on table butter chicken. Patiala chicken Dal tadka. and roties. Which is worst test in non veg. Other items we never try. Not professionals very bad staff.. very bad invornament..Not for Families and friends.. better to come home wash your hands.. un hygienic hand wash area...ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«...",1,"2018-08-06 08:35:40",4,4,0

"1318893","WeÂ were looking for aÂ Punjabi dhaba type restaurant in Gachibowli area and thought of going to Dhaba 13. We were disappointed by looking at the ambience of Dhaba 13 and were returning. Then we saw thisÂ dhaba just besides it. It actually looks like a dhaba on highway. The owner (Sardarji) was very courteousÂ and prompt to welcome us, offer us a table and providing the menu. That was a nice feeling. The menu consists of few combo items as well as the individual curries. We ordered one Paneer makhani thali, which came with a paneer curry, dal, aloo dry curry with 2 regular rotis. I felt the quantity was little less for Rs. 200, but the taste was good. We also ordered chola bhatura which came with 3 bhaturas and chole; that was really nice.Â The tandoori rotis were veryÂ good, cooked to perfection. Though the tandooriÂ rotis are available almost everywhere in Hyderabad, butÂ this was something special.Â The lassi was also good. Overall a nice and clean place for quick Punjabi food. I think the prices can be revisited once; the price of the combo items are on little higher side considering the ambience and establishment.",4,"2018-07-30 15:30:59",18,4,0

"4563231","I ordered from this outlet today. 
We ordered Kadhai Paneer and Tandoori rotis. 
The gravy of paneer tasted really good. Especially for the North Indians in a city like Hyderabad. 
I did not like their quality of paneer. It was hard. And somewhat bitter. Also the quantity of paneer in the gravy was less. 
But overall quantity was good. 
And the tandoori rotis were cooked perfectly, and most importantly they were made from whole wheat.
