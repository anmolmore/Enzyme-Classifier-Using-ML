"1700577","Zega is a beautiful Pan Asian restaurant located amidst the lavish property of Sheraton Hyderabad. The restaurant has got a great ambiance to it and serves some of the authentic Pan Asian dishes that one could ask for.
I went there for their ongoing Dimsum food festival with my pals and had a great time overall. The Dimsum food festival had a variety of Thukpa options ranging from Chicken, Mutton, Pork and the veg version alongside some beautifully crafted dimsums inspired from China. Next up, there was an option for various wok tossed gravies and some delicious desserts.
The first thing to try out was their Chicken Thukpa. It was simply delicious. The broth was super special and it had a balanced proportion of sweet, spice and tang into it which was amazing. The amount of veggies and noodles were also quite balanced and overall, it was an absolute winner. This was something I personally recommend all of you to try.
Next up, we were offered some of their Dimsums. The showstopper of the day were Pan fried Chicken Gyoza, Pok choi roasted garlic and Napa Cabbage Crystals, Prawn crystal wraps and Vegetable beijing dumpling. The Prawn crystal wraps had a tad sweet soy used as a sauce which could have had a slight more kick to it otherwise all these are a must try.
For mains, we ordered for Wok tossed Chicken in Dry chilli cashews, Crispy fish in chilli plum sauce along side Vegetable fried rice and Vegetable wok tossed soft noodles. The Chicken in dry chilli cashwes was the clear winner of the lot and was simply wonderful. It was a tad saltier in the first serving but we got it amended thanks to the chef. Overall, the main course was good and had clean, authentic flavors.
With out tummies full and our satisfaction levels reached, we decided to go ahead with their Toffee banana with palm sugar ice cream. This was magical. I have been a lover of Toffee banana but this fusion right here was mind blowing. The creaminess of the palm sugar ice cream went on fantastically with the crispy banana toffee and was a big boost for our palate.
All in all, it is a place to sit back, relax and enjoy a great layout of Pan Asian food. The staff is highly cooperative and seeks a lot of feedback which is a great thing. Happy eating. :)",4,"2019-05-13 11:07:35",275,1978,10
"30464956","It's been a very long desire to taste the pan Asian food at Zega, very beautiful place with a spectacular view from the outlet, well balanced ambience with nice live kitchen and interactive bar, coming to the service its seems very low manned for every order we have to stand up and request someone to attend for our request, taste of the food was just ok, need to relook into the clasic dishes, over all it was a very average dining experience at zega.",2,"2019-05-09 22:15:34",67,159,3

Butter-Garlic-Lime Crisp Fish and Classic Kung Pao Chicken with steamed rice were our favourites. The staff are very polite and give good suggestions which suit your food palate.

"29055446","It was an IPL Sunday evening when we went to this place, the food tastes really good unlike other 4-5 star hotel restaurants where food is average. Ambience was just ok as it was too dull according to me.  The highlight of this place is its open till late night 2 am and has an amazing roof top.
We order 1 veg and 3 non veg starters and all were perfectly done. Specially mention for Butter garlic fish (if u like buttery flavour) which was just superb. 
The only thing which I didn‚Äôt like was the portion size which was too less. 
And yes you get booze served here even on dry days üòâ",4,"2019-04-23 17:13:50",25,68,3

"1705045","I had visited Zega on Weekdays for Lunch few times earlier and felt underwhelmed overall. Last visit for a Sunday dinner changed the perception however. First of all, the ambiance comes alive in the night with a lounge like feel, and even the otherwise boring corporate concrete jungle around seems better in the night from a height. I am guessing they put their best efforts on a weekend compared to weekdays as the food quality was significantly better. Food order was two varieties of veg sushis (the crispy one was very well made), soft noodles, and a coconut based Thai curry (which was neither too sweet nor heavy on the stomach, very well made overall). And the place was quite packed as well making it lively. Overall, worth visiting.",4,"2019-04-08 13:15:28",119,110,0

Chilli chicken, fish, paneer were also of subtle taste. The lamb starter should have been more soft & in eatable consistency. Egg and chicken friedrice was not having any salt. Veg Thai Curry was ok to some extent. Diff types of chicken noodles were ordered which was of average taste. Schezwan veg fried rice was below average.

"2284812","I‚Äôve visited this place located on the tenth floor of Sheraton hotel for a Sunday lunch at 3 pm. Should I say the service was slightly ignorant? They seemed taken aback by having to serve me at that point of time. 
Anyways,
The hotel is magnificent and provides a beautifully view of the city if seated in a right place.
Chicken gyoza was rightfully bland. 3/5
California uramaki , great as always . 4/5
Japanese minced prawns , chicken skallion and butter skewers - was impressed by the name but not so mouth watering and very bland. 3/5

"60891649","This luxurious restaurant is located in one of the most posh areas of Hyderabad. Situated on the 10th floor of Sheraton, the extravaganza starts right from its entrance. Unlike it's location, it is not too economical, neither expensive to skint  you out of money. The ambiance is subtle, dim lights and decorated with fancy wooden furniture to add the extra wowness. The menu is sorted, right from starters to main course to desserts! We ordered slowly cooked lamb, freshly prepared chicken and shrimp... These were from the chef's menu!! Not a highly preferred place, however, you can visit for the experience of high end hospitality!",5,"2019-01-03 16:43:08",19,694,1

"3889811","This is a fantastic place. I rated them 1 star on my first visit. They were apologetic (invited me again immediately) and I didn‚Äôt show up until after 10months because of the traumatic first visit. They have upped their standards significantly since. Best hot and sour soup on par with any Chinatown joint across the world - bamboo shoots, shiitake mushroom and all the works. Gyoza is good. Heck everything they served was good on my second visit. Special shoutout to the lady who mixes the drinks - a true professional. Her Nirvana cocktail is just that - sinful pleasure. I went there on consecutive weekends. Tip - go during the day because it is well lit and has a wonderful view outside. I will be there again. Cost is very reasonable for the place which is a very pleasant surprise. I will be there again for some more of the Nirvana potion. ",5,"2018-12-04 22:13:50",9,11,0
"2471140","Chinese cuisine is a comfort food for me. And the chef quickly noticed this after a quich talk with him. I curse myself for not remembering his name now.
Chef prepared a special chicken fried rice for me as I was not in a mood to order from their menu. And it was pure magic. I also ordered the dimsums which recalled me my darjeeling trip. ",5,"2018-11-29 20:30:17",32,183,0

"32026990","This place is good unless you look at the menu card. It's like drinking alcohol and having good food and finding out you paid extra which you could have saved if you would have gone to a similar place with much less to spend. 900 rs for a glass of wine ? Well not worth going twice specially if other places are serving the same wine for 400 a glass.
But if you're a first timer the you must visit just to remind yourself there are other places much more cheap than this.
DJ plays some really nice music.
And one advantage is that this place is opened till 2 am.",3,"2018-07-03 00:15:40",4,6,0

"22578","This is an amazing place to hang out. 10 th floor. Ask for Neel or Arjun to get best of the hospitality. Sai is the masters for making the deadly drinks. Awesome place to unwind. Be here and you will realise. Crispy veg is a must to try and feel the heaven.

"53444820","Would not like to even give 1* as Service was pathetic. Staff was appearing to be busy and had no courtesy to attend our table in the centre of the restaurant. Starters were served after main dish though they were ordered much before. One of the staff half served a dish to a couple of guests on our table and hopped to other table without finishing her task without any apology. We had to keep on asking for a dish (Sushi) which was ordered 90 mins. before it was served. Noisy place...",1,"2018-06-20 08:21:51",4,3,0
"1241012","Table was not clean and there were stains on it, obviously not a 5 start standard. Food was ok ok not something great with limited variety on menu. Service was below average as they were not prompt I had to wait every time to get something served on the plate or need to call them and ask to serve. On a whole the experience was very poor. Nothing great when I visited with my wife for dinner.",2,"2018-06-11 12:56:09",15,55,1

We ordered ‚Äúprawns tempura maki‚Äù and ‚Äúdragon sushi‚Äù, both were amazing. Mock tails have a very limited menu (but that‚Äôs how it is :D) The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Ambiance is cool. Good music and they have private seating sections too. This place is open until late night, hence, giving a little levy on time. They have a nice terrace (city view) which is open for everyone. Do visit this place if you want to try some amazing ‚Äúsushis‚Äù.",4,"2018-06-06 16:31:39",60,54,0

We ordered kung pao chicken, homemade icecream, beers and some rice.",3,"2018-06-01 00:15:12",121,3014,7
"34899393","There are places that deserve a 5 star but they're worth a single visit. This one's different. The restaurant experience was 5 star indeed and deserves multiple visits. The food taste and quality exceeded the expectations. The presentation was great. Nice and courteous waiting with quick service.
However, the security of the hotel (Sheraton) in which this marvellous diner was in, did not know that the hotel even had a restaurant called Zega. Also, there's no elevator from the underground parking space.
It was a 5 star experience for the restaurant, the ambience and the food. But I cannot say the same for the convenience at the main entrance.
Anyway. It's a must visit. I apologise for the 4 stars it easily deserves a 5. But, I really had no choice based on the inconvenience at the entrance. ",4,"2018-05-28 22:20:28",5,36,0

"15795291","If there is one place where one can get good food, excellent service, a beautiful ambience without the snootyness of a 5 star, it would be zega. We visit this place often esp at night. Pradeepto the bartender is v creative and makes some excellent drinks..based on your preferences (in addition to what's on the menu). Definitely worth a try!",5,"2018-05-27 06:30:09",83,233,0

"542534","We went for a family dinner on 15th April. Being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba. Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7-8 min, whereas in any other 5 star, a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry. However we went inside and opted for a buffet. The food spread was very good however, few of them were cold(roast chkn and fish tikka). The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert. The most annoying thing was the on the table service. The table wasnt ready when we were seated. We had to ask for napkin, spoon, fork and even for a glass of water. Multiple times. The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean. The taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star.

I keep asking for the kimchi :)
Nothing can go wrong with your order here just feel free and order whatever your heart permits and your tongue ask for it.
Everyone offers you great service especially Kirti (the pretty girl in her suit I hope am recalling her name correctly)

"803530","Had been there for lunch on a Friday afternoon. they have a very cosy atmosphere with a wonderful view of the Gachibowli Road from atop the 10th floor. Their food was something that we thoroughly enjoyed. we had their awesome tyangra style hakka fired prawns which was sweet and mildly spicy. there were about 6 chunky prawns in a plate. Their Maki salmon sushi was great as well if not the best. Then we had the Chinese barbecue Pork belly ribs which was chunky, succulent and juicy. in short, we had a really great meal and look forward to a second visit there soon.",4,"2018-04-10 23:11:33",34,93,0
