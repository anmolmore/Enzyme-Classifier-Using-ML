"49697754","The one star is not for food, it's pretty decent.
I visited with my friends and the crowd was really less. We were there for a short period of time and awaiting our cab. The staff was constantly asking ""Aap ka hogaya?"".
We informed that we are waiting for our cab and the one of the staff member pointed out there is your cab.
They just wanted to get rid of us, was the place crowded no? were we eating there for free? no.
Never visiting this place again...",1,"2019-05-15 01:11:11",5,3,0

"38709627","Litti chokha lovers missing this delicious dish in Hyderabad can definitely give it a try. They serve litti with 3 variants of chutneys, chokha and salad.
Chokha was a mixture of potatoes, tomatoes, brinjal, garlic and green chillies.
Littis were properly baked and had sattu in it. Overall a healthy dish. I also tried mutter panner here. It tasted good.
The vibe here is happening with good music and they also have birthday celebration space.
I would recommend this place.",4,"2019-05-06 16:12:02",6,2,0

"33520116","Ordered litti chokha seing good reviews. They sent 2 littis with chokha, two chutneys, onions and lemon. The littis were good enough however the chokha was bland..the only taste i was getting was of mustard. No freshmess of coriander, flavour of garlic, or onion taste. Both of the chutneys wrre tasting almost the same. The only dominating taste was of raw mustard which overpowered everything. The food lacked freshness. They need to work on making fresh chokha with fresh flavours.",3,"2019-04-22 21:54:51",25,33,0
"15672861","Its an open space eating place famous for their litti chokha. Although they have a range of options to order.
Recommend this place if you want to try litti chokha. They serve it with chokha and 3 types of chutni.
The service is very slow so you need to be really active to ensure that your order is through. ",3,"2019-03-18 12:22:02",111,688,1

"2125650","This is THE place for Litti Chokha. (drops the mic)
Food : 4.5/5 The Litti Cokha is just amazing, sitting in Hyderabad and getting such quality food that reminds you of your home town stalls is really something. Would have been nicer if the Chokha was a bit more hotter/spicy. But understand that such taste would not go well with lot of foodies here. I have gone there again and again for Litti Chokha and have very rarely tried other things. This time tried the Chinese plate and really liked that too.
Service : 3.5/5 It was a self service join which now services your table. Timely service and good behavior there is very little more to expect.
Ambiance : 3/5 Has a very nicely maintained outdoor sitting beside road.
Price : 4/5 The place is very reasonably priced for Hyderabad standards (though 2 litti for 100 bucks might sound expensive to someone from east India ;) ).¬† Portions are good and taste is impeccable.",4,"2018-11-15 01:51:00",78,1608,0
