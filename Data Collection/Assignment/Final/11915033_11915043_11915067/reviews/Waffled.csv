"3201521","Warm waffle with a scoop of Raspberry ice cream... now that is what I loved !
If you would like to indulge in Chocolate, do get a pocket friendly Chocolate Puffle waffle... its too much for an individual to finish off !
The outlet gives you ample space to move around and also good seatings...",4,"2019-02-04 10:52:30",179,1202,0

Puffle Waffle is the leader of this Waffle Battalion, it has so many stuffs in it like choc bytes, choco sticks, ""Nutties"" ‚ù§ and many more... it was a monster and can get you high !!!
This was served in a cup which made it really tough to have it, when we registered this discomfort, he owners were quick to let us know that they already have a fix for it and will be in store soon...
Waffled shares space with Plush and they get some really nice icecream scoops to join their waffles from Plush...
Personal Favorite was Waffle with Raspberry icecream...
I wanted to have their Red velvet waffle, unfortunately they ran out of stock...",4,"2019-02-04 08:06:20",4,12,4

The ambience is vivid and playful with paintings on the wall and the creative interiors that is perfect for a budget friendly outing with friends and family that serves signature waffles which definitely sweep you off your feet.
The original crispy waffles are freshly baked on order and come with exciting toppings such as nutella, chocolate, cream cheese, raspberry, blueberry, maple syrup and a lot more that goes well with whipped cream and paired ice cream scoop on the side. My absolute favorites were the below. 
The BLUEBERRY WAFFLE was topped with blueberry jam, served with Blueberry ice cream and whipped cream.
The CHOCOLATE WAFFLE was topped with chocolate sauce, served with Chocolate cookie ice cream and whipped cream. 
The RASPBERRY WAFFLE was topped with raspberry jam, served with Raspberry ice cream and whipped cream.
NUTELLA WAFFLE was topped with nutella spread, chocolate wafers, served with Chocolate ice cream and whipped cream.
The PUFFLE WAFFLE served with chocolate ice cream, wafers and whipped cream had an amazing texture and a burst of flavors from the very first bite that wants you crave for more.
So the next time you have a craving for a sweet tooth, you know where to get WAFFLED!!",4,"2019-02-01 07:01:02",87,369,0
"33769278","Waffled is located along with Plush, Gachibowli. I was for a tasting session along with my bunch of foodies.
They have a vast menu ranging different types of flavours to choose from. They are ranged from 110 - 150 rupees. Amongst them, we had tired:
‚û°Ô∏è Chocolate waffle: Checked waffle served with chocolate Icecream and whipped cream. Waffle was very smooth and tatsy.
‚û°Ô∏è Raspberry and Blueberry waffle: Both came with their sauces spread on the waffle batter with their flavoured ice-cream. Blueberry was little tangy and unnatural, raspberry was quite authentic.
They also have Puffle waffle from which have tried
‚û°Ô∏è Chocolate Puffle waffle: Bubbled shaped waffle served in a glass of ice-cream topped with chocolate sauce, choco bytes, chocolate sticks, nutties and whipped cream. This was the best of all. An absolute lover for just 150 rupees.
Overall, a nice little place to have waffles and ice-creams with your loved ones.

The waffle itself is mainly of two types ‚Äî your regular chequers style, and the newer puffle waffle. The latter is more like a bubble waffle. As is the custom, each waffle is served with a side of a scoop of icecream and a dollop of whipped cream.
Listing down the ones I tried ~
‚Ä¢ Chocolate waffle - We got this with cookies and cream ice-cream and it was dreamy! üòç
‚Ä¢ Raspberry Waffle, Blueberry Waffle - Waffles smeared with berry jams, and served with raspberry and blueberry ice-cream scoops (Bonus: the ice-creams contain actual fruit bits!)
‚Ä¢ Chocolate Puffle Waffle - This was the star of the day. Priced aplty at 150 bucks, this hug waffle is folded into a glass and topped with chocolate scoop and whipped cream. ü§§ MUST TRY!!
Bottom line ‚Äî The prices are nominal, but the taste is phenomenal! ",5,"2019-01-31 20:47:23",150,2106,7
"39216844","Excellent new place in Gachibowli for your Waffle cravings.
Went to this place with my foodie friends a couple of days back. Totally loved the ambience . Starting from the face of the truck to the painted canvases.
We had different types of waffles here starting from the Nutella waffle followed by the Raspberry and Blueberry waffle.
I personally loved the Belgian Chocolate the most.
They have launched a special dish called the puffled waffle which is a waffle which is puffed out like pancakes filled with softy ice cream of vanilla and chocolate.
Highly recommend this place to everybody.",5,"2019-01-31 11:50:34",180,1896,4
"30883441","Since weekend is a dessert day for me I plan to have waffle. So one of my friend suggested me this place. I went there and found the ambiance very cool. Then after seeing the menu I ordered.
Chocolate waffle- which is waffle with chocolate syrup and scoop of ice cream. It tasted good.
Raspberry waffle- so people who like to have jam, this one is for them because waffle had raspberry jam on it.
Nuttela waffle- this one is the best one because yes it's nuttela. There was topping of choco crunchies
Blueberry waffle-this was again like raspberry because blueberry jam was over the waffle served with the ice cream scoop
Puffle waffle-this was my favorite whipped cream on waffle with chocolate flavor and soft waffle. This one made my day
Over all I will conclude that this is a really cool place to have waffle. There waffle are really soft, crispy and fresh. Loved the place",5,"2019-01-31 00:10:50",60,120,4

Visited this place on last Sunday Evening with my foodies gang. This place is joined with plush creamery with ample of seating space and beautiful ambiance. Still some of the work is under work but still nice. Service is good too.
Coming to the dishes, we have tried several waffles.
Chocolate waffle - This is the most basic one but beautifully done.
Raspberry waffle - This was served with amazing raspberry scope with some jam on the waffle was amazing.
Nuttela waffle - This one is the üåü loved it. Must try.
Blueberry waffle - it was decent only thing was at the last some strong flavour which was not that amazing.
Puffle waffle - One of the best one I had and was amazing in taste. Whipped cream with such a soft waffle was great in taste. Only issue was the cup but we later on came to know that they will come up with the bigger cup later on.
Completely loved the waffles as it was so fresh and soft, best think was the whipped cream served with all the waffles. Price wise also its quite decent and will love to visit again for sure.
Must try üåü
