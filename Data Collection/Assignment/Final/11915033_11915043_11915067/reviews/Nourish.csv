"49462468","This place serves some really good bubble tea. The flavours will pop in your mouth!
The ice tea is really bad though. I would suggest not to try it.
The ice-creams and cold coffee are good.
The variety in the menu is nice.",4,"2018-11-19 12:24:59",111,1007,3
"77067653","Will not recommend. Drinks are all flavoured and sugary on top of that they have to put Nitrogen. Fruit ice creams hardly had any fruits.
They served 10 people in 1 hour and that too we ordered only 10 items.",1,"2018-11-08 16:06:33",1,0,0
