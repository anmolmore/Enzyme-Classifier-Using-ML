"37401226","This one is near to paradise gachibowli. The ambience is decent and the service is fine. We tried the pepper chicken for starters and then for main course, we tried kolhapuri paneer with butter naan and tandoori roti. Pepper chicken but the quantity was too less for their price. Either the quantity or price could be changed. Main course was fine, especially butter naan was really nice. ",3,"2019-02-12 23:43:51",144,246,2

Main course was also good. Chicken Biryani was awesome in desserts. Rasmalai was mouth smashing. Honestly we had enjoyed a lot. Ambiance is nice. Service was good and staff also.

We went for Ala-carte and taste of food is too low.
Even buffet experience is also not worth for cost",1,"2019-02-07 20:28:55",26,22,0
"54300248","Been exploring about restaurants in Gachibowli and found this place. Been to this restaurant ordered chicken drumsticks and spl chicken biryani which tasted really good, finally ended with a good dinner. As the taste was good ordered a non veg combo next day and surprised to see a cockroach in the meal. It was really a bad experience to see a cockroach where the restaurant has taken away all the positive views that I had towards it. Please don’t play with health of customers, it takes time for anybody to order food again if we come across these situations. Please note that Restaurants shouldn’t be the place to hospitalise customers by making them unhealthy. Apologies will not do anything, maintain healthy and hygiene environment. Thank you olive, you lost a customer and I will not visit this place anymore.",1,"2019-01-31 16:39:26",2,1,1
"37616423","This is a good place for north Indian food to have. We went very late around 10pm BT they are open till 11 i guess. We ordered golden prawns, tandoori chicken bhuna murg, butter nan. The tandoori which was really good.only the masala kulcha was not upto the mark and less pieces with no masala inside it. This is a zomato gold resturant which can save you bucks.

"30307683","A decent restaurant among pubs and restaurant in Indira Nagar to have some proper North Indian food.
In food, I tried Paneer tikka masala, masala kulcha, and some masala Papad. All of them were pretty good. It has the complete feel of a family restaurant and the prices are also pretty reasonable. The quantity of the food is decent as compared to the price.
The ambiance is nice and the staff is courteous.",4,"2018-12-30 14:00:26",179,1874,7

Their dishes were a great deal. Maybe not any different from the regular items, but were really tasty. And mutton rogan josh, is a must try.",4,"2018-11-28 10:33:11",30,180,0
"599375","It was my 4th order with Olive Garden in the last 6 months.  I loved the food from this place and this is the reason I ended up ordering from here multiple times.
This time it was a total disappointment in terms of the Veg Food and the service that was provided.
There was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for Veg Dum Biryani & Veg Pulao.  Both of these dishes were same I don't know how the restaurant makes that difference - still wondering.
In terms of the service, I ordered the food from Zomato at 8.00PM and the time of delivery was shown as 8.55PM.  I ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing, however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 9.30 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time.
I would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with Biryani & Pualo.
Service wise I would rate this place a 2.5
The manager/executive from the restaurant to whom I spoke over the phone just kept saying one thing that sir we are working on your order and it will take 10 mins.",3,"2018-11-21 19:27:39",10,27,0
"37407502","After getting suggestion from one of my friends, we went tonight there for the dinner. We were two and ordered Tandoor Chicken, Virgin Mojito cocktail, Veg Fried Rice and Schezwan Chicken...All the items were extremely good and very tasty. The price of each item in the menu was satisfactory. The behavior of the staffs were also so calm and polite. They accepted Zomato Gold too. We appreciate the job of the cook and the staffs there. The decoration and the sweet 90s music made the dinner fantastic. Loved to visit the restaurant and will surely visit again.",5,"2018-11-18 23:48:23",15,8,0
"39118650","We visited this place on a weeknight so there was very less crowd. The veg food was okay. On nonveg side we tried their buffet. They served soup with 2 starters, salad and some veg starters. The soup and the starters (the apolo fish and the chicken kebab which was not even close to any kebab) was good. The curry and roti was okay and the biryani they served was tasty. Overall the food was not bad with very reasonable rate. The place was comfortable and the service was quick.

"678733","Have been here many times. I was a frequent at their madhapur branch since 2006. Its a quiet place and family friendly. The lift is old, dark and horrible. It feels it will breakdown, except that it doesn't. They tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one. Coming to the food. Its just okay. Nothing outstanding or too bad. Starters and Chicken items are usually good enough. Their tandoori chicken doesn't have breast portion. I couldn't understand the rationale behind it, its just leg, thigh and wings. And yes I don't know why they have downgraded their crockery. They serve curries in smaller household type steel bowls.",3,"2018-11-03 11:17:19",23,6,0
"55210374","Bought coupon from nearbuy @ 375. It was mentioned that the actual price is 469 which is false.I have attached the price tag mentioned at their hotel.
I compared it with the other hotels near by and I feel it is highly overpriced.It should be aroud 250.
Very limited starters and sweet items as compared to other nearby hotels.",1,"2018-10-12 14:42:56",2,1,0

"27888455","We've been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters.
So as soon as we reached the spot, we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area. The interior was also tiny and seemed confined.
Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic, chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant. The staff were ok, not quick but not rash though. Even though they got our food very late, they somehow tried to convince us with something non-relatable situations.
Forgetting all that, we just wanted to concentrate on our food. As soon as we had our first bite, the first thing that came to our mind was - it's good but not great. The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices.
Overall, it's a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay/work near Gachibowli. This is not a place to visit from a long distance.

Starters Non veg- appollo fish was very tasty and was on the spicy side, chicken tandoori was good. The chicken soup was thick and delicious.
Maincourse- Veg Biriyani, chicken biriyani and white rice. Chicken curry was tasty and the chicken was nicely cooked. The mutton curry was not up to the mark. There are different bread items like butter Naan, kulcha and butter roti also. Other items like veg curry, dal fry, rasam was ok.
Desserts- Fresh cut watermelon, ice cream, Bombay halwa. The gulabjamun and the caramel custard was super delicious.

"2698588","New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.

I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here.",3,"2018-07-31 20:53:33",101,332,0

Veg white sauce pasta and chettinad chicken biryani for mains.. There was a lotttt of cheese in pasta.. Taste was on another level.. Biryani was spicy.. A little disappointed that the spice level dominated the flavor.. But rest of the items compensated for this..

Also they support Amex, which was quite nice as I am unable to use my CC at a lot of restaurants.
