Loved the pav bhaji and rasmalai. Hope to visit again and try out other stuff as well. Kaju katli was good to taste but was a bit on dry side and thick sliced.",4,"2019-02-27 01:22:05",61,119,0

Have been to this place multiple times. Parking becomes an issue here during busy times in the evening. Recently ordered Boondi Laddu and Samosas from this place.
Boondi Laddu was overloaded with color which was off - putting. Taste wise was just OK.
Samosas are good here though. I liked the filling in the aloo samosa.",3,"2018-10-25 19:40:14",77,323,1
