"83295755","Hi, I ordered a veg biryani from the restaurant. It was very nicely made and tasted awesome. I love the flavours of different veggies used in preparation. It was hot when served. 1 plate can serve two people easily. Curry was also very nice. The deal was at very nominal price. Thanks Zomato and restaurant for its services.",5,"2019-03-16 15:24:02",9,1,0
