"27059566","We, a group of 15 people visited for dinner on 16th April 2019 for a colleague‚Äôs farewell get together. First of all .. they are NOT accepting Zomato Gold (despite being listed on zomato). They blamed on zomato of being unprofessional for some issue, best known to them. Secondly, the overall staff seems to be utterly unsatisfied and hence, unprofessional. There was hardly any food (quantity wise) kept for the buffet. We had to repeatedly request to refill. The manager, Mr Vijay Kumar (got his name after asking 5 staff members) is a shame to the hotel. I only wish we never went there. Most importantly, we didn‚Äôt like the taste of the food as well. Strongly recommend avoiding the restaurant. ",1,"2019-04-18 01:13:46",1,82,0
"37794020","We had a good breakfast at this place. The south Indian cuisine is delicious here, But all the other cuisines are just average. In Beverages, It had only papaya juice, bitter guard juice and chocolate milkshake which are not up to the mark. If you are a south food lover, this is the best place to have your food.",4,"2019-04-09 12:02:56",18,18,1
"39975834","Went for a lunch buffet here.
First of all the surroundings is beautifully made. The chain of restaurants is really nice.
The food quality and variety was good. The taste was also good. There was also a live counter for pasta and dosa.
The non veg and veg varieties are also appreciable.
I would recommend you guys to go there once. It was a good experience.",4,"2019-03-29 00:51:38",42,49,4

Not a big buffet spread, but the food is great over here. liked the fish curry and mutton curry.
Live counter has dosa prepared. Desserts were great.

"1153682","We have been here for dinner last night and we kept our expectations minimum looking at the reviews for this restaurant. Buffet is as mentioned in the menu - consists of 2 non-vegetarian starters(1chicken and 1fish) , 2 veg starters(paneer and spring roll), chicken curry, mutton curry, fish curry and usual main course followed by limited set of deserts. Rotisserie were good and food was okayish. Could've been better at deserts and starters. Live counters were not great as one was serving dosas upon request and other was veg salad. Ambience is okay and service was courteous. Bit heavily priced for the regular buffet they offered. One thing noticed was soft drinks were not sold at MRP but for a modified price(25rs can sold for 100rs). I think this shouldn't be encouraged. Note that there is no wallet parking and don't expect the 5-star ambience(gst still is 18%, though). ",2,"2018-11-11 14:26:49",38,718,0

"35718304","Visited Ella for a buffet lunch with my team on Friday. Both indoor & outdoor seating is available. Very tidy, well-spaced and warm ambience. 
The buffet is average includes south/ north Indian and continental spread. The presentation is attractive and the service staff is humble too. The fish preparation is worth mentioning both the starter & the main course, while the overall food was just average.",3,"2018-06-22 17:33:54",90,117,9
"8169781","This place is good for a buffet. I had stayed at Ella¬†for some 6 days we had our food here most of the time. The buffet spread is good. Some dishes are very good. I have liked the fish, biriyani and parotas. The dessert collection is few but well arranged and presented.¬† They have variety with Chinese, continental and south Indian dishes. The live counter is good but nothing superlative. I like the space and feeling of open with the big glassed walls. The staff is very courteous.",3,"2018-05-19 14:36:24",61,1188,0
"657929","A quiet, cozy place with great food and no loud music. Bang in the heart of Gachibowli area but cut off from the bustle. The buffet is perfect with a wide range of cuisine (North Indian, South Indian, European, Chinese, salads, desserts) and their a la carte menu is good too.
This place is a favourite of the entire family and I often take people out for lunch or dinner here too. I wonder why this has such a low rating here, coz I have never had a bad experience.... Perhaps the food not being super spicy has something to do with it; or maybe the lack of loud music, etc. OTOH these are positives for me.

"29223328","The restaurant is situated at the lobby level of Ella Hotel, apparently it's a 24x7 option but there was hardly anything in the mid night menu out of which half of the things chef denied to prepare due to whatever reasons.
Ambience is decent and the place is clean.
Finally, numerous rallies to the kitchen by the server, caeser salad was served which was made really well.",3,"2018-04-12 17:45:24",53,272,1
"42241708","I was at Ellaa for 2 nights and breakfast was included with room at Indus. I enjoyed the breakfast here, there were many varieties here like, Poha, Upma, Sausages, Puri Bhaaji, Pancake, Idly, Dosa, Medu Wada, Aalu Paratha, Paneer Paratha, Breads with butter & jam, Egg Bhurji, Egg Counter for Omelets, Fresh Fruits, 2 types of Juices, Tea, Coffee.
Watermelon Juice was really bad. Tea Coffee was very average. White bread quality was bad.¬†
I really enjoyed Poha, Puri Bhaaji & Medu Wada on both the days.
It's a budget hotel, The hotel rating I would give it as 3 star as the Room Service is BAD and it takes forever to deliver food to the room.

Drinks: tried coco mango, virgin mojito, cranberry fizz, and of all these coco mango just amazed me and it was WOWüòç
FOOD: Ahh...whr shall i start? We had veg lunch buffet and there was a huge variety, 2 starters, soup, main course, desserts. To a special mention, papdi chat, baby corn, mushroom cream soup, noodles, biryani, chocolate pastry, gulab jamun, kiwi mousse, halwa, all were sumptuous and  recommended.
The things which went wrong were Pasta, completely bland, bhindi masala, not even good in presentation, palak paneer was bad, some virgin mojito drink, it wasn't even a drink, just a sugary syrup.
Dahi wada was soft, and juicy and i loved it.

"45163686","Well my friend was insisting me to visit this place from a very long time ,and finally we went to thus place 
Coming to the services ,firstly when I entered the place I visited the washroom ,and the opening of the door was quiet confusing and I thought I am locked ,so first they need to really work on the easy locks of the bathroom rooms
Coming to the staffs ,they were quiet curtcious and responsive and they indeed made sure that the extra plates were cleared in the table from time to time 
Coming to the variety of the food in the menu ,they had a decent variety ,and yes coming to the dessert option had limited choices in the english dessert counter as most of them were with egg ,and the options that were available in which one of them was blackforest jelly which tasted real bad .Apart from this they had a live counter for dosa and chat ,there were quiet a variety of ice cream flavours ,coming to the food menu they had 3 to 4 variety of salad ,one veg and one non veg soup with the 3 to 4 variety of buns ,then they had chinese starters like baby corn and manchurian ,noodles and spageti and in the indian item they few variety of bread and 3sabjis which I am not a very big fan of 
Coming to the taste of the food ,I loved the spagethi and the munchurian it was truly amazing,the sweet corn soup was also good,and in the variety of salad the corn salad tasted the best ,the ice creams were normal as you get everywhere,the indian desserts were good too and north indian is something which I dont touch ,so cant comment much on that
Coming to pricing I felt it was 800/- for the buffet ,I felt this was a bit on the higher side but the variety wasnt that vast so 600/- for this buffet could had been a apt pricing
Altogether this place is above average but not very good",3,"2018-02-01 00:20:19",172,1184,0

Didn't really expect such a large spread for breakfast buffet at the Ellaa Hotel. The food was great with a lot of varieties ranging from Indian, continental and European. Although European cuisine was quite far away from its original form and taste, the effort could be appreciated. The south Indian and north Indian dishes were quite up to the mark.

"358984","It was one of the most pathetic breakfasts I had ever eaten at a 5-star establishment. Almost all tables were messy, missing napkins, glasses or cutlery. We settled on one and asked for everything. Everyone was running around, the waiters, as well as the guys in black suits who I guess, were one grade about the servers. The offering was Indian specific and nothing of note was offered in the continental section.¬†
There were rock hard stale pastries like croissants and danishes but they were almost unedible. When asked for water, the server just picked up glasses randomly from other tables and put them on our table. One of the glasses was a used one with a clear indication of lips on the glass. The guys at the live counter were uptight, they were like what and why do you want anything from here. Poori ran out for a good 10 minutes and we had to wait for a refill. I can go on but I have to stop somewhere. That was a disaster of a breakfast. As mentioned above, the place was filthy, disgusting and dirty, there are no words to manage how ill managed this restaurant is.jeewan.me",1,"2017-06-25 08:22:45",47,160,1

"1291095","Just now had a lunch buffet at Indus. The spread wasn't that great and there wasn't anything that stood out. Started with the jal-jeera that lacked any sort of flavor. Golgappas at live counter were ok-ish. Liked the egg starters and dahi-wadas. Mutton Rogan josh was flavorful but meat was undercooked so had quite a struggle there. Chicken curry was okay and so was the Hunan fish. Dessert spread disappointed for ice creams weren't really tasty. Coffee kalakand tasted like coffee bite, just a little more bitter! Swiss roll was okay and the other barfi, which tasted like coconut barfi, was good. Lack of drinks/mocktails, specialty items and desserts just took it away from them. Since it was a buffet, service wasn't really put to test but looked decent.",3,"2017-02-10 16:14:21",84,511,0

"3053087","Visited Ella with a group of friends for dinner. We chose to go with buffet.
The entrance of the the Ella group increased our hopes and expectations of a fine dining experience. Until the entrance of the Indus restaurant, the feel is classy. The ambiance of the restaurant is awesome.
For religious reasons, I preferred to have vegetarian food on this day. To begin with the starters, Onion Rings and Potato Sheek Kebabs were served. Onion rings were good; it had very less coating and aptly fried. The Potato Sheek Kebabs were over fried. It is very clear that color has been added to show the dish as a proper kebab.
Veg Hot n Sour Soup was hot & spicy; but it was not thick. It looked more like Veg clear soup with boiled vegetables and spice.
Among the vegetarian salad, Russian Salad and Alu chole were good. But I did hear from my friends who tasted Chicken and Fish that the non-veg starters lacked spice, taste; its bland.
I wonder two kinds of dal(Palak and makhni) were served. Typically, in a buffet, only one variety of dal is served. Both of them didnt go well with my taste buds.
Sambar was less than mediocre; more watery with added sambar masala.
Corn Pulao was as bland as it could be.
Disappointed with the main course, I moved on to desserts. Jilebi was cold, soft and soggy. Besan Laddu, Chocolate Brownie, Coffee Kalakand... none of them were good and our entire group was left wandering.. how can all the desserts be messed up. Except for Mango Ice cream nothing was worth mentioning among the desserts.
Overall ambiance & service were good; but whats the fun when the taste of food was completely bland and tasteless.

1. The starters served were cold enough to use them as ice for our drinks. :(
2. The salted ones were stoned by the salt, for high BP patients, we made it mandatory to stay a kilometer away. :(
3. The buffet was pretty limited, we expected a huge spread for the price tag, so I will not say that it was VFM. The biggest disappointment was at the sweet counter which was limited to 2, despite being informed that we have lot of mouths having sweet tooth.
Since then, I made it pretty clear in my mind not to visit the place even if I have those discount coupons or offers.¬†

"375579","Bought coupon through little app and even after checking the bad rating thought of giving it a try.
Ambience - Great.
Service - Slow.
Menu - Less items.
Taste - We reached till 1PM and thought everything might be ready but we were wrong. There was no welcome drink. The items were still getting filled. After waiting for 15mins, we started with starters. Being a vegan, i took the available 2 veg starters and my friend being a non-veg started with the available 2 non-veg starters. I have been to a lot of places for buffet and never imagined some restaurant serving ""bhajji"" for veg starters. That was really disappointing. The other starter was good. Similar non-veg starter scenario, they had egg-bhajji and other item was good. Main point was they had become COLD.
After starters moved to main course, which also had a few items only not like other restaurants where there are a lot of items and again it disappointed me but went with the hope that taste will be good. Dahi wada were tasty. Chinese main course was okay but north indian main course really bad. The taste was not at all good. They had live counters but no one was present. Thought it is not there but since i had paid money for buffet which included of live counter i asked them and they told it has pasta and dosa. @Mangement - please always keep a person standing so people can have from main counters. Biryani was bad. In the middle of main course, they had brought the welcome drink which was chocolate milk shake and it was not so chilled. Moving to desserts, it had 2 sweets and 2 pastries and cut fruits and some pineapple kesariya which was tasteless. They had 4 kind of icecreams which was the only good thing. It had no item which i felt like taking again.
Advice - Please improve the taste of the food items and keep it hot and welcome drinks should be chilled and served in the beginning. Also position your items so people can see it properly and on live counters the chef should be present even when customers are not there. Maintain the level of a 5 star hotel.",1,"2016-03-20 17:52:43",112,573,5

The buffet spread was rich in taste , of course I hold a disclaimer for people having a spicy tooth. It's not going to please them, but people who want to experiment with food they will definitely enjoy it.I have good variety of bread on my platter, with fish soup (though am not a big fan of soup, but this was really a breaking point for me). Quite a nice experiment! Next had few non-veg and veg starters(except the meat balls rest were good), some noodles, had choice from the¬†live counter(chaat, appam and many more). The food was good , warm and fresh which was the best part. service was good at all time. The place being lit with nice lightening effect and based on theme music was good to sit down and have few conversations over a good spread of buffet. The place¬†was not crowded and I liked to have my choice at ease. ¬†The last section being the dessert area which was so refreshing again. There was no regular sweet item but one can get all terms of varieties. Gulab jamun, ghewar rabdi, apricot pudding, chocolate pudding, firni kheer and many others. A nice place to have a lunch or dinner time with family, friends. One can also sit outside and enjoy the natural ambience with a live counter being addressed there too.",4.5,"2016-02-07 16:38:25",137,287,3

My experience during dinner buffet was good, but when we sat in the lawn there were lot of mosquitoes that spoiled the evening. Though the management tried to handle that with some mosquito coils there wasn't much use and the smell of mosquito coils spoiled it more.
Later when I visited this place for lunch buffet the experience was awful. The starters were served only once. The staff told that they will serve starters at table only but we got the starters only once in first 20 min. We got frustrated and asked the staff for starters no. of times, their answer was ""its coming"", which never came for first 30min. We were too hungry, so continued with the main course. The main course was not wide spread. Every item was normal nothing great. Biryani was ok. Limited desserts for what they charge.

There aren't much options you get to choose from. I mean, this being an upscale place you'd expect decent choice and you end up being let down there. 
Some of the dishes taste amazing (like the chicken starters,biryani and pasta) and the rest were very bland and unappealing. But there heroes of the day were...you guessed it...the desserts! Absolutely yum! Decent mix of Indian and Continental. No problems there.

This was the worst morning ever. The menu spread was limited with not many juice options and muffins and breads. The aloo poori which is meant to be hot and savory was tasteless with non-existent aloo in the gravy. The most disappointing section was south indian food. The sambhar was spicy and the mysore bonda was stretchy like a rubber. The staff was not at their best and the service was extremely bad. They could not even serve a simple hot coffee.¬†
The price does not justify the taste, quality and the service that you would expect from a star hotel like Ella.

"29209386","Contrary to all reviews here, I have had an excellent experience at Indus, Ellaa on every visit, be it for the Buffet breakfast or the Ala Carte dinner!¬†The dining area looks nothing exceptional, but sure makes for a decent fine dining experience. 
Coming to the breakfast buffet, they have a good spread of dishes across cusines. The south indian items in the spread taste great and equally delectable are their chicken sandwiches, desserts, choice of breads and muffins and other continental items. More often than not, breakfast buffets have a wide spread with only 2-3 items having that exceptional taste, but at Indus, all their items had good taste and were definitely worth trying! Infact their breakfast is one of the best you can have in hyderabad, and at unbelievable prices! You sure can't beat their taste and prices for the breakfast! ¬†¬†
Having tried their dinner Ala carte, I can safely recommend trying their Chicken kababs, kadai paneer and assortment of naans (Special mention for the garlic naan). The dal varieties aren't great and should be avoided!
Overall, Indus is great for their breakfast spread and decent for their paneer curries! Service is good and the staff is definitely well trained!¬†The best part being that it's never too over crowded, making it a great calm, relaxed setting!

With an amazing ambience even at the morning hours, the large fields of grass and garden lying which you can see even from the dining area the place is a beauty.
