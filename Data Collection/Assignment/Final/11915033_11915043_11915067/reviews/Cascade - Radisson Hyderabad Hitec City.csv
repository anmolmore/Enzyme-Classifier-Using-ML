"42162925","I had the opportunity to be at Cascade for 4 days and I must say the food served here was of top quality and the service rendered by the staff members was very courteous and on time. 
On the fourth day, I noticed that ""Naan"" wasn't available at the counter but when I enquired it, they immediately arranged it at my seat promptly. 
Chef Tarunima was checking with all the customers and educating them on the availability of live counters. 
Overall an excellent service, looking forward to joining again with family.
Thank you for all the great work you guys do!",5,"2019-04-02 00:56:25",2,15,0

"1060549","Had been to this place for a team lunch two weeks ago. A very good place for team gathering, With a widespread buffet and very nice service, this place is highly recommended. The starters and main course were equally good. The variety of desserts were very nice.  And the cold stone ice cream counter was wonderful.

"37381843","Sunday brunch experience at Cascade-Radisson. It was a mixed experience because they had things we loved but also things we hated, I’ll describe in the review.
Service was really good, one of the best. Mr. Salim and staff really did a great job to host us. Plus point for them! 
Ambiance instead was a total let down, at least for us. Floor was dirty (as you can see in some pics), chairs were dirty, even the water bottle was dirty. The restaurant itself has nothing special, no atmosphere... just bland. If you want to go and have a good time and to enjoy the atmosphere this is a NO NO!
Food was on the good side. It had good spread and some really good items as fish in butter sauce or polenta with mushroom ragou. Starters were average as desserts. The best part on desserts was the fresh made waffles. All other items are usually like everywhere, salad counter, pizza and pasta counter etc. With some small exceptions has nothing special on menu but not bad on taste.
When it comes to the price for the buffet I think is too expensive. Most of the times we go out with some kind of discounts or coupons but at full price definitely not worth it!

"88582523","I visited cascade with my relatives, but there is no ward to appreciate really, the food is really awesome, starting from soup, starter, main course, dessert, chaat, everything thing is above excellent. We don't find any fault in quality, service, ambience, decor, staff behaviour, neat and clean, hygiene everything is above excellent. We strongly recommend to try cascade. If you are not going to cascade then definitely you are going to miss something in life. Staff misfit and pranks is excellent. Wonderful experience, never thought. This is one of the best restaurant.

"48372980","One of the most pathetic and tasteless food i ever had. This 1 rating is also only because of ambience. Remaining things just shit. I went for buffet here having lots and lots of expectations, but all waste. I didnot understand still what cuisines or what food they are trying to serve ! First of all , all the menu in the buffet were cold, i felt like i am eating a day before's food. Not at all fresh. You will find lots and lots of varities in buffet, but when it comes to taste, disappointed. It was completely waste of money. Services and hospitality was somewhat good. But i am not at all happy with this place. To the Management ,here is request Please Change your menu and the way you cook. There are many other places which serves far better food. I cannt even think to visit this place again.

"84128263","It was really amazing experience, went there for our wedding anniversary with my kid, thoroughly enjoyed the food, great ambiance and amazing hospitality, they have decorated the table and arranged a candle light dinner, they didn’t charge anything for my kid, gave some specially prepared food for her, and a very good welcome drink. I want to mention special thanks to Salim, who is the head of the hospitality there and Nischit who took care of us for almost 2 hours 30 mins. I don’t have any complaints, from the starters to deserts everything was so perfect, it was a perfect wedding anniversary, never forget this. Thoroughly enjoyed to the core, I would recommend everyone to try, bill was just 2100 rs, as he gave discount of 20% which I didn’t believe initially. Thanks again Salim.

"90367600","Enjoying my last hours in this hotel. 
The staff is very helpful. I really had a nice time staying here. The rooms was great... shower was perfect. They cleaned the room everyday. 
As for the restaurant staff... i have to say that Pranika was very very polite and she gave me a good feeling. Anything i wanted she helped me with it. i can say that by far she made me feel at home. The only thing that was a little bit frustrating....was the fact that the wifi wasn’t working properly everywhere in the hotel. Maybe a little thing for the hotel management to work on.
But the fact that the wifi wasn’t working properly  will not hold me back to  recommend this hotel.
I will give this hotel 4 stars. 😀",4,"2019-01-16 11:16:21",1,1,0

"38049215","We went for the buffet lunch at Radisson after a few years. The overall experience was very average. There were events going on and the place was overcrowded. Very few staff to help/assist.
Coming to food, some items on the buffet were decent. The basics liike Paneer curry, lacha paratha etc were good.
Salads and chaats were OK.
Desserts were below average.
The one thing that is usually safe is a pizza. They had pasta and pizzas as part of the buffet. Unfortunately they couldn't get the pizza to taste decent. I had to leave pizza and eat something else, which I never do.
Poor experience overall and unlikely to return again. ",3,"2018-11-20 08:19:18",34,233,0

Their service is really good and I find the ambience very relaxed. The a la carte section is quite limited and basic but they do make a pretty mean grilled fish dish.",3,"2018-06-30 13:57:19",90,514,1

After a wait of 10 minutes we found our table.First impressions about the Buffet was that the spread was huge and also contained many live counters. It had a nice mix of South Indian, North Indian and Continental dishes. 
I tried many of their dishes but the items I liked the most here are Palak Idly, Cheese Omelette, Chicken Sausages, fresh Grape juice, White Chocolate Berliner and Black currant Yogurt.epicureantales.com",4,"2018-06-27 10:55:08",443,2461,24

"43573341","Cascade is a luxury dining restaurant that falls under the notorious Carlson Group of Hotels and offers multi-cuisine dishes.
The tremendous ambiance fully complements the canons of the place and instantly lightens up your mood into musical. An addition to the offering is an elaborate buffet for foodies. Cascade is in Gachibowli main road.
It’s located on the second floor of the property. While the lobby is inviting, it only dispels all the doubts about the food being as inviting as the lobby. As you enter Cascade, you are greeted by a Buddha Statue.
As soon as you enter their food counter spread all over at the corner side. we had a few veg and non -veg salad, sausage with spinach. Started picking one of one and observed fish was stale and seems It was reused. The chicken was hard and sausage was almost beginning to wring itself.
Actually, none of the salads were any good, partly because they weren’t fresh - something that is supposed to be figurative of a salad – “freshness”.
Starters : We had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. Veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. Non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. They had little variety of but not so tasty starters.
Anyway, rushed towards main course ‘Dal makhani” which was waste. Or in another word, I was searching for Dal Makhani flavor. And I feel, in this level of restaurant at least Dal Makhani should be right!
Moved ahead and tried vegetable dum biryani with Mutton curry. I must appreciate, mutton curry was yummy and cooked properly but in the same dum biryani could be better.
For desserts, it's a good mix of Indian (including Hyderabadi bestseller Double Ka Meetha) and European delicacies.
I am not much of a dessert being, but was glad to see a large number of desserts in the buffet.
Overall, I will not call it astonishing stuff, but it has wonderful musical spacious place with decent ambiance but they need to improve food side a lot.",3,"2018-05-15 10:42:07",71,2079,0
"54258078","Went there for a dinner buffet. Highly disappointing. Firstly, they quoted wrong price over the call. On top of it, there were very limited items in the buffet.

"538260","The largest breakfast buffet by a long shot in Hyderabad. I was surprised by the choices on offer. Spend the weekend here in this hotel and did not have lunch on both the days due to stuffing myself up at breakfast. 
- cereals, breads, pastries 
- eggs, grilled vegetables, breakfast smoothies, sausages 
-idli, dosas,Uthappa, vada with different condiments 
- Chinese noodles with some stir fry vegetables and chicken stew 
- poori with bhaji and pav, chicken kheema 
- cheese and cold cuts 
- fresh fruits 
I have probably not gone over the entire spread as there was more.
Service was polite and courteous and we had no complaints whatsoever, the food also tasted pretty good. I won’t hesitate coming back just for breakfast on weekends... loved it! ",5,"2018-03-25 08:51:53",69,120,0

"158963","We came here for a buffet dinner over the weekend and it was a blast!
Ambiance: Well it's Radisson, so the place looks amazing and one side has huge windows that overlook the gachibowli road. On the opposite is a nice glass wall with water running over it. The spread is at the end with the soups on one side veg and non-veg starters on one side and main course on the other side. Live chat, breads and ice-cream counters on the side. There are beautiful chandeliers and the lighting. The place looks really good.
Food: First of all the spread was amazing. We had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. Veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. Non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. The fish was really good and I enjoyed the chicken starters especially the peri peri chicken. 
In main course we had lamb stew, jamaican jerk chicken, kung pao fish and another fish item with coconut rice, steamed rice, noodles with veg and non-veg biryani. For vegetarians we had paneer tikka masala, dal, baked veggies and few other options. The best item was the jerk chicken followed by the kung pao. I also tried the samosa chat which was quite good.
Finally came the desserts. There were cakes, halwa, macaroons and various other items. The macaroons were the best followed by the cheese cake.
All in all a very nice meal with a lot of options and great service.",4,"2018-01-09 13:42:24",366,3961,14
"20455519","Exquisite buffet breakfast spread covering South Indian, North Indian, a bit of American and Italian cuisine with Gouda cheese. I had my first pesarattu there and yes, i loved it. I really wish they would serve pancakes too and most importantly have labels for dishes which are to be made to order. You must try their range of English desserts, croissants, donuts and biscuits. They also have an array of unique jams which would melt your heart with the soft bread. Overall a delightful experience.

Breakfast review - 
A typical buffet everyday seems very wide spread with options for everyone. There are about 10 Indian options like Idlis, wada, dosas to order, pav bhaji, puris, parathas to order, upma, poha etc. I couldn’t try everything, but the paneer paratha was very good and I totally recommend. The bakery counter has multiple selections too that comprises of different bread rolls, basic breads, butter/filled croissants, choices of donuts (excellent), cupcakes etc.! They also have several selections of beverages (hot and cold and soy drinks too), vegan options on request, variants of muesli and cereals, choice of cheese, salads, fruits, etc. They have western (cold cuts etc.) and Asian (noodles and rice) alternatives too! 
Pros: Widespread buffet, most of the spread is very good in taste, helpful staff, comfortable seating.
Suggestion - Would be nice if the staff smiles and makes it more welcoming.

Ambience: The place was too bright for a fine dine. The presence of buffet right under the nose of fine diners was not really a good idea. 
Etiquette: People were nice and professional. Expected minor surprise for the birthday girl as it happens in many fine dine restaurant when you book table in advance and mentioned what is the occasion. 
Food: Moderately priced. However, they lack variety. For a fine dine, we expected a few new items on the menu but it wasn't. Taste wise food was good. However, the food doesn't tickle you taste buds. 
Presentation: It was not too great. Mediocre not too fancy. 
Verdict: You may visit there for a fancier place in comparison to standalone restaurant.

Cons: Food variety and taste.",2.5,"2017-11-16 15:39:07",4,12,2
"975655","We went to Cascade for Birthday dinner and opted for buffet.
Ambiance: very beautiful. Not clustered and has a relaxed atmosphere to it. 
Service: the moment you go in they had all the details as I had booked through a app and we were escorted to our table the service has been prompt and excellent with polite staff and courteous behavior. 
Food: Very good spread. lot of options for salad. I went for the egg salad and the chicken salad. Very tasty.
Starters: good spread of veg and non veg. Very happy with the Hong Kong fish and zaffrani chicken. both were very tasty and must have. In veg crispy veg was a must have. Most of the starters were cold. Considering we went almost at the beginning not sure how it can be cold so fast. Moving on to the main course. another great spread and good options for veg and non veg. Fish was very salty so i had to pass that. other dishes were very good and mashed potato is a must try. Chettinad chicken was another must have. They had rotis and nans to order (live). I tried the Mongolian rice from the live counter. did not excite my taste buds much. Another problem with the main course some items were cold or lukewarm. 
Some more options in main course was one veg biryani, Mutton biryani, chicken curry, Chicken curry was something I would go for again but not so much happy with the biryani but again being a hyderbadi the taste buds for biryani is absolutely different. 
Desserts: another vast variety and i will give it 10/10. 
Overall: if not for the food being cold and fish item being salty the rating would have been better. Overall I would recommend this place for a casual dining. if you are looking for a place to have a relaxed atmosphere and have food at leisure away from the hustle and bustle this is a good place to be. 
Suggestion: I some how feel the placing of the spread was not apt. I mean it was very confusing at time and we had to take help again and again. for example. Soups is placed after the biryani. A little more organized would be good...",3.5,"2017-10-23 06:06:40",24,22,0
"260065","A buffet with a nice spread and value for money pricing is always in demand. The “Spices Unlimited” buffet at Cascade, the all-day dining restaurant at Radisson Hitech City is an example of this. The newly revamped menu of this buffet, on for both lunch and dinner, ensures that everyone has something suiting his palate. Quite a number of live counters make this even more interesting. 
The buffet is priced at an attractive Rs 1255 (all taxes included). Invited for a review of the buffet, I first did a recce of the items served. I was happy to note that huge spread had something for everybody. There were dishes from different cuisines, ranging from North Indian, South Indian, local Hyderabadi, Pan-Asian to continental. Live counters included those for dosa, ice creams as well as pasta and pizza. The dessert counter looked pretty extensive too. 
Among the starters was Paniyaram, the round batter balls popular as a breakfast or snacks. This was served with three types of chutneys – coconut, mint and tomato. I usually do not try veg starters but this was soft and good and the chutneys were delicious.Other vegetarian starters included Potli Samosa, Kothmir Vada, and assorted vegetables in Chilli Sauce. Veg Sushis were also on display, but I did not try it.
Chicken Quesadilas filled with a nice stuffing and grilled was one attractive dish in the non-veg section. Fish Tikka was a little bit too spicy for me. Chicken Nuggets, Pepper Fish and Shanghai Chicken Dry were the other non-vegetarian appetizers.
The pizzas for the day included a simple Margarita as well as Chicken Pizza.I tried a couple of dosas from the live counter – my choice was the Kheema Dosa though the Beetroot Dosa was a novelty too for its looks, like the coloured burgers which are in vogue these days. 
The buffet also had an extensive salad bar with highlights such as Braised Chicken & Mushroom Salad and Roasted Lamb with Onion & Cabbage.
Over to the main courses. Continental cuisine seems to be a strong point of the chef team. The vegetarian main courses included Balsamic Grilled Vegetables, a dish which had babycorn, carrots and beans in a balsamic vinegar based sauce. The sweet and sour Vegetable Caponata was another dish of note. Lamb Ossobuco, an Italian main course of lamb shanks with a dark gravy was one dish that was really good. Poached Fish in a watery gravy did not have much of taste, the same applies for the Roasted Potatoes. 
The Chinese part of the buffet had quite a good collection too. Fish Thai Red Curry went well with Szechuan Noodles. There was a vegetarian dish Mushroom & Bamboo Shoot in Scallion Sauce which also attracted my attention. 
The Indian section had biryanis, both veg and non-veg which are must for any Hyderabadi buffet. The other local dish was Hyderabadi Fish Curry. From the Andhra kitchen, Kodi Koora and Ulavacharu made their mark. Maa ki Dal and Matar Paneer were the Punjabi dishes served.
I am not much of a dessert person, but was happy to see a large number of desserts in the buffet. Sweets included Shrikhand, Rasmadhuri and Hot Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. Overall, I will not call it extraordinary stuff, but it was a nice spread and a value-for-money buffet. The lunch buffet which I attended on a weekday had a huge rush, pointing to the popularity of the restaurant. The menu changes every day so that the regular clientele is provided with a change of taste.

We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality, variety of dishes and a great ambience. But somehow, we don't know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it. It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that, we don't know.
When I retrospect back home, I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there. Not that they were rude but they didn't care much. The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us.
Well, coming to the dishes, we had a nice sumptuous dinner. The best part was the dessert section. If had a variety of spreads. It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes.
Oh, boy! I had a ball.
Had the staff had been a little attentive, I'd have rated an easy 4.0! I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy. But we've been too many 5-star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently.

Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City has lauched an all-new buffet at their all-day dining restaurant Cascade and I was invited to try it out recently.
Being housed in a star property, the place has subtle interior designing, a great buffet area and a sprawling dessert counter with a mind blowing array of desserts.
While I loved the samosas, cheese calzones, a couple of Indian dishes from the buffet like the butter garlic naan and the curries, overall their food does leave a lot to be desired. Desserts such as black current ice cream and brownies were good.instagram.com",3.5,"2017-08-24 14:59:25",279,1947,6

- Buttermilk served was very bland and can be improved
- Items were not hot most of the time.

They do not believe in serving a glass of water unless specifically asked for after 20 minutes of being there. The smell of the cleaning liquid was so strong that i lost my appetite and to top it gave me a splitting headache. Although they claim it to be open 24 hours, they apparently start cleaning up the place around midnight. Customers be damned! I asked them to pack up the food because there was no way i was going to eat from there bearing the mind numbing smell. After the food parcel was given, they wouldn't give me the cheque unless of course, again specifically asked for.

First things first
The staff was extremely courteous , ministrant and assistive. This was something we were really impressed with everything they did as in they helped us with baby chair as requested by us for our daughter and also made sure we were seated comfortably.
Ambiance was more or less okish as the place was crowded and we could smell food everywhere. However we were given an option to sit on the other side of the restaurant where sitting was still better.
Food- We somehow had great expectations with food out here which was a disappointing factor.
Being vegetarian, the food choices were very less as in starters we had Pizza, Paneer Tikka and baby corns. Moving to main course we had only two options aloo sabzi and paneer kofta. There was a live counter of dal fry as well.
So, besides the food being palatable , we still were looking for a few more things in main course.
Not so good- The service was pretty slow may be because we were sitting on the other side of the restaurant or may be due to the servers being very busy. But , the time taken for serving mocktails and dal fry was forever which is not expected from fine dining restaurants and such big five star hotels.
Overall, we enjoyed the main course as the food was delicious and so was mocktail.
