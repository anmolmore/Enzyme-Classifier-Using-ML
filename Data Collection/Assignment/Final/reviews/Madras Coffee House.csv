Been here Everytime whenever my coffee addict BF and are out of our house..taking a detour is never a bad decision because MCH served the best coffee for the right price. On my very first visit, I knew I would be a regular customer to this coffee shop. They also serve Patti samosa, punjabi samosa, cookies, banana chips amongst the other snacks.
Patti samosa is my favourite side snack along with their filter coffee.
I am a coffee lover and I love this place. You will love this too if you are a coffee lover.
