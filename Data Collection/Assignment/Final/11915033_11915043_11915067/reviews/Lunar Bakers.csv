Till date, this outlet doesn’t disappoint with quality and taste so I highly recommend Cake from this outlet.foodiexp.wordpress.com",3.5,"2016-05-30 22:04:42",170,1513,1
"1944468","This bakery is so bad, that it shouldn't even be called a bakery. Their cakes are generally rock solid and eggy. The snacks are stale, no crunch.. the worst experience was the Chicken sandwich! Sigh. 
Giving it an average rating because it has been an emergency cakes retort when I forget a friend's birthday.",2.5,"2016-05-16 23:32:48",98,906,0

"32911281","It is one of the Bakers Inn outlets in Hyderabad. This is located adjacent to Sardarji’s Dhaba, Indira Nagar. It is a bakery shop and has few seats available inside. It serves cakes, puffs, donuts, biscuits, breads and other items. We ordered Butterscotch cake (half Kg – Rs. 350). The cake was really good. I did not try other items.
Good thing is that they accept food coupon but the prices are little bit high compared to others (like Just bake).",3,"2016-03-15 23:51:27",40,84,5
"4430961","It's nothing more than a bakery. As u all know its a part of bakers inn . they make delicious cakes , get ready to get embarrassed because of the beggers outside . they hunt you down till u give them something.. I had the worst experience here. I and my friends took pastries and sat outside coz the weather was pleasant. Beggars came up suddenly and were staring at our pastries that we couldn't eat . so we gave them and left that place",3,"2015-09-26 01:58:48",62,89,0
"1012420","Bakers Inn is best place to have cakes and pastries in Gachibowli, it has got seating arrangement and recommend for Pastries fans.

"1558998","I went for a new year cake. The shop was so ugly n the cakes was so bad at that time. All filled with mosquitos. I think they tied on 31st night. N the staff always changing. One day I asked for egg puff parcel. But she parceled vegg puff. After coming home only I came to know that. N decide no to go next time.",1.5,"2015-08-01 23:07:08",24,32,0
"14541441","A average place which makes a great chicken burger and chocolate fudge pastries.
This place is common for birthday cakes though there are few other places around which can also be a good option.",3,"2015-07-14 15:20:45",685,792,0

"545853","A wing of bakers Inn located in the food zone of indira nagar adjacent to sardar hi dhaba.
A double shetter bakery with seating space n front standing place.
A typical bakery where they serve puffs,pastries n cakes and food comes from central kitchen and stock is limited .
Except for the cakes nothing is impressive .tried puffs n burgers which r average.pasteries r below average n service is pathetic.
Only 1 person is there to serve n no body cleans the table after dining.
Pricing is lil high compared to their other outlets .since there are no bakeries near by ppl tend to go this place.",3,"2015-05-30 19:27:35",328,1432,1
"20243038","Cakes and more used to be one of my favorite pastry shops, that is until....
Over the past year the place has become very unhygienic, it's dark and dingy. The air-conditioning doesn't work on most days and the pastries are often stale.
Overall this place has become very avoidable and hasn't lived upto the standards it started with.",1,"2015-04-17 20:43:28",26,68,0

"15783727","I happened to buy a White Forest cake at this place on New Year eve. When we cut the cake, it was full of nauseating nail polish smell. When tasted the cake, I had a burning feeling in my throat and stomach all night long.I took it back to the store and the guys in the store too agreed that the cake is having a chemical smell, but they could not give any answer why this has happened.  Tried to reach their manager, but as is the norm, the guy is avoiding all phone calls. Suggest you to never ever visit this store, and put the health of yours and your loved ones at risk.",1,"2015-01-02 17:30:00",1,0,0

"61399","When I don't argue about the price set for a Cake, I want it looking perfect and I am very conscious about how it looks. I need a cake to surprise someone on his/her birthday and it is supposed to be special and I won't buy average stuff unless I run out of choices. 
When I went to buy a Chocolate cake to this particular bakery, what surprised me was that all but three of the ones on display were made on order and not for sale. Imagine yourself walking into a bakery and after selecting a cake, being told that it is for someone else and you need to settle for second best.
Ok, so with the tied hands of not being able to go anywhere else/in haste and having to choose from just three, a pineapple, a mango and a chocolate chip cake, I had to go for the obvious. Priced at 700 bucks, it wasn't cheap anyways. But it did have a lot of choco chip topping missing on the sides through which you could see the white and bread layers inside. Now this doesn't look good at all. Imagine yourself opening a box of cake when the clock hits 12:00 and what do people see?
So I asked for extra chips that I can use to fill the gaps, but no so surprisingly, they don't bake there and hence don't have it in stock. Now, what do I do? Pay 700 and take the substandard offering? Hell No!! I bargain to bring down the price to 600 and buy extra choco chips of the 100 saved, from another store and make the cake look awesome like it should (if I had the chance to buy choco chips which I in fact didn't so I had to settle for just the bargain, sadly).
I will not settle for second best if I am paying the full price and if I am getting second best, I will not pay in full. Sounds Middle Class? Well it is called No-Compromise. 
To tell you honestly, the cake did taste good but I am not sure If I would visit them again due to the lack of choices. And yes the service is excruciatingly slow and you do feel unwelcome.",2.5,"2014-05-08 17:37:18",180,1866,0
"1270124","Cakes N More is good. The snack, the pastries, the chocolates everything: tastes good. All available at reasonable rate. It my my hot favourite for Birthday Cakes. The only problem is that it does not have vegetarian pastries available, so, it is a fuss to go their for people like me, the vegetarians. Although, i may like to add that, if we place an order for veg items earlier, they provide the facility to get it done.",3.5,"2013-10-19 20:26:54",80,70,0
"1311354","I stay very close to Cakes n More in Gachibowli. I was very happy that a bakery was opening in the vicinity. The bakery is not up to the mark of other cakes n more shops. The variety is less and cakes are not fresh. They do not take orders in short notice. I have to frequently go to Cakes n crisps or Country Oven in Madhapur to order Birthday Cakes. Their price is also more than the average price of the cakes in the area.",3,"2013-10-15 17:58:26",23,203,0
"1218909","I wanted a cake in short span of time and i got to know that these guys launched website.  I have ordered a cake on their website and the service was amazing, i got a call instantly once i ordered and i requested them to deliver in Aparna sarovar where i stay and i got the cake with in two hours. The guy asked me to refrigerate it for some time and as always cake was yummy.  I am a regular customer for them since years and they never let me down. 
The new service that they launched was awesome and now apart from making excellent cakes they also have excellent service.",5,"2013-09-17 13:53:57",1,0,0
"59550","The cakes are decent, but the service is PATHETIC. The people don't know how to take the order. They usually don't deliver. I have ordered cakes at least 5 times from here and on 4 occasions, they have got the spelling wrong. So if you need a pick up, its decent, but if you are looking for something delivered, its pathetic.",1,"2013-06-28 14:07:19",8,238,0

"475454","One of the most awful customer service I have ever witnessed!
Cakes N More is a Strict No No!!!
Apparently, they have not been delivering for past one month due to unavailability of vehicle and the staff is very indifferent & unresponsive. I had placed an order at new year for a cake with special message icing. They gave away my order to some other customer without letting me know and shut their shop prematurely. No communication or concern for the customer.
Even though some of their stuff (litchi cake & blueberry muffins are good), I would strongly discourage fellow customers to give it a try.
Total Thumbs down!",1,"2013-01-01 23:18:15",1,1,0
"385209","Awesome pastries!
The ""More Chocolate"" cake definitely makes you crave for more.
Other baked goods are not as delicious as the cakes served by them.",4,"2012-11-22 18:43:44",24,25,0
"363772","Its pretty good. I have been there for couple of times. They can add more variety to the store. There are very less options to choose from, but whatever present there is good enough to visit back the place.",4,"2012-10-28 12:49:11",60,277,0
"95935","Been here a few times for picking up baked goodies while on the way home from office but was usually disappointed by the variety available by evening time.
The pastries are nice enough though not in the same class as Vacs, especially the chocolate ones.
One item that I really liked here was the blueberry muffins, once heated they are really soft and gooey with melted blueberries on the inside. The other muffins unfortunately were nowhere near as good.
The date and almond pie was a little too sweet for my liking but the pie itself was made just right and should be tried at least once.
The puffs are quite well made and crispy for the most part but they were a little bland for my taste, perhaps more filling and less puff pastry would be a better combination.
Overall a decent bakery with some really good items and some average ones.",3,"2012-10-25 22:42:57",125,751,0
"301659","I am more of a pastry person because a nice big cake screams of endless calories. Pastries tell you that you can have just that much and ITS OK. Cakes N More does a good job of simple cravings for desserts and general bakes. I like their Apple Struddle and their breads are fresh and truly what they claim it to be. I rarely see Multi-Grain bread as fresh as theirs. Go for it as the Always- Reliable- Bakery next door.",3,"2012-10-08 16:49:35",57,176,0
