"10","43404922","Masquerade by Mystery Rooms is the first of its kind novelty cafe in the city that is a complete entertainment package full of fun, games and mystery (and lip smacking food that doesn't burn a hole in your pocket üòã)
Play board games, read a book, engage your kids in fun video games or a duel of darts, this place has it all. Framed super hero posters, a lovely ambience in yellow and green and a huge screen to live stream your favourite sports - do I go on or you need more reasons to visit?
The menu is extensive and a great mix of different cuisines - don't miss the delectable nachos, chipotle cheesy paneer and fish tikka, the flavorful Thai green curry and the range of milkshakes.
The star of the menu though undoubtedly is the Masquerade Mystery Melon - a freshing thick milkshake with some mysterious flavours - oreo, walnuts, jellies, bananas - the shake seemed to have it all! üçà

"13","27009985","New place but does looks tempting. This is one of amongst many such new restaurants popping up in Hyderabad but will it be a little different well they do have an added benefit of the Mystery Rooms with them but food they have a long way to go. So my first order here was very limited thus follow your instincts too. We ordered chocolate waffle ,tacos and some shakes.
So shakes and tacos were ok but the definite problem was the waffle. We ordered a chocolate waffle but we received was a waffle full with jams of different flavors alongside of a good chocolate dressing on aide and loads of nuts sprinkled over with a side of chocolate ice cream I don't know about others but the taste of waffle was lost for me amongst so many other sweeter flavors. So not a good choice to order. Secondly the cutlery is definitely cute and trendsy but doesn't fulfills it's task.
So the service was much slower. The guy took over 20 minutes to just get our order out but that might just be ignorable but would suggest them to have so.e friendly staff for such an enthusiastic place they should have enthusiastic servers too.
This place looks good for small get togethers too.
This was my first time going there but I would definitely be interested in going there again and try out more dishes but till then the stars from my side would be 2 only ",2,"2019-04-14 18:37:13",122,852,2

A happening place where one can get indulge with their mystic theme and Outstanding food that to at pretty reasonable prices!
The entrance has a one abstract props which frags the attention and also you'll be occupied with their other interesting things placed and hung on walls...
The food at this place called ONION RINGS were the best till date I've ever had.
Good amount of cheese and Crunchiness on every bite!
They've also got VR GAMES, PLAY STATION AND OTHER INTERIORS GAMES AS WELL.
Everywhere you must have DRUMS OF HEAVEN but these were literally as tasty as Heaven!
Perfect moist, perfect spice level and messy food.
And when you order NAWABO KI SHAAN it means you should be aware that something Ridiculous is going to be served on your table...
And yes 6 large chicken legs stuffed with sauteed veggies and layers of masala, tandoor well served hot on table which literally was an feast to my eyes. If you appreciate good Flavors so yes you gotta try this out!
The dish that gets most attention at masquerade is CHICKEN LEG PEG & CHEESE NAAN.
This had the tons and tons of flavour in it and the chicken was super fluffy and Cheesy inside and both of these combination was MIND BLOWING!
I never had something like this before...
A must try tho ‚ù§Ô∏è
BAKED MAC & CHEESE was something which lures me by the taste of it! Was Rich and creamy and smooth too.
I enjoyed this dish because it was served as promised on menu!
KEEMA PAO FONDUE was a below the bar...
Mashed meat and veggies with garlic bread.
This could have been done better by not mashing the meat completely and addition of butter to make it moist and can be served with PAO only.
MASQUERADE MYSTERY MELON was inviting but didn't go with the taste of Melon. Was expecting a fruity taste but it was more like a normal shake.",4,"2019-04-14 11:07:19",190,2098,5

As soon as you enter the place you‚Äôll be mesmerised by their interior. Their interior and decor is remarkable. They have board games, VR zone, play station, Electronic dart machine and with good collection of books like a mini library. Once you go in you‚Äôll feel like never coming out. They have live screening too and the background playlist they have is really amazing.  
Mystery rooms are another level of attraction.
Coming to food:
We tried Mocktails like
1. Summer Hummer
2. Masquerade Mystery melon
Which were so reanimating & revitalising, perfect for the summer.
Next coming to the Starters:
1. Chilli potato 
2. Corn chilli cigars
3. Chilli chicken 
4. Butter chicken Samosa
If you‚Äôre a spice lover these dishes are a must try! All were finger licking good. You won‚Äôt regret spending money on these.
Main course time:
We had 
1. Chicken burger &
2. Mafia pizza
If you‚Äôre that ‚Äúextra cheese please‚Äù person then you should definitely go for Mafia pizza and the burger was worth ordering, it was too delicious.
In dessert we tried Brownie with Ice cream which was so amazing, perfect balance of chocolate brownie with butterscotch Ice cream.
Overall my experience @Masquerade Cafe & Experience lounge was fabulous. This place is a must visit to have some chill time with pals. 
The hospitality was great. And the staff was very kind and polite.",5,"2019-04-10 18:28:19",80,1135,25
"19","50113671","Mystery Rooms has launched Masquerade, a multi-cuisine caf√© and experience lounge, in Gachibowli, Hyderabad. Masquerade is high on the entertainment quotient, with a virtual reality zone, PlayStation, a dart machine, board games, etc. The cafe has everything that you look for in a place to make unforgettable memories. Ambiance and the decor draw inspiration from the melodramatic feel of Masquerade. The place is very bright, colorful to lift your spirits high. There is a corner with a shelf of books for all the book lovers.¬†
We started off with Mocktails. Caramel Mojito and Strawberry Mojito. Respective flavors were added to the regular Mojito. Sunrise: It≈õ orange-pineapple juice perfect for the summers. Mocktails were little extra sweet.
Food :
Chilli Chicken: Presented on a wooden plate, it was delicious with being sweet, spicy and crispy on the other hand.
Chicken Burger: Juicy, moist chicken patty stuffed in a grilled bun and topped with a cherry tomato!
Chicken Pizza: Loved the flavor, but the base can be better.¬†
Keema Pao: Full of flavor, tang and spice, ground minced meat curry is served in a key like a plate, with bread alongside!!. Must try!!
Masquerade Mystery Melon : Most delicious and creatively presented dessert. It is stuffed in a muskmelon with oreo cookies stuck on the eitherside.
Murgh Tangdi : Spicy, tender, delicious Tangdi chicken!¬†
You can enjoy the company of your favorite set of people with scrumptious food and lots of entertainment all in one place.",5,"2019-04-10 12:49:40",75,179,19

"21","49437288","Visited Masquerade yesterday for a soft launch of the caf√©.
We had the Vegetarian food that they had to offer. üå±
Soon as you enter through the doors, you're transported to a world so colorful, bright and cheerful, that you can't help but feel energised. Even on Mondays. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The ambiance is modern, pop culture inspired. So it's very vibrant. Every corner is picture worthy. And there's something for everyone. Kids or adults. Be it books, gaming console, mystery rooms if your inner Sherlock needs a challenge, IPL screening. You name it, they have it.
We started off with Mocktails.
We got Cinderella, which had peach and pomogranate undertones. It wasn't too sweet and very colorful.
And Caramel Mojito. A twist to the regular Mojito. We absolutely loved it. It was very refreshing, light and happy.
Of the two, we clearly liked Mojito better.
Next up was Nachos with Bean Salsa.
Served in a platter shaped like an umbrella, nachos were loaded with baked/cooked beans and cheese. It was good although we don't fancy nachos much.
Then came in Mushrooms. We didn't quite get its name right. But it was delicious. Mushrooms were juicy, spicy and delectable.
Up next was Jalapenos and Pepper Tacos.
Crisp taco shells were stuffed with beans, which tasted very similar to the bean salsa of the Nachos but with a little bell peppers and other greens.
Followed by Paneer Tikka Sandwich was served with a side of fries. Between the three layers of bread was very saucy, spicy, flavorful soft chunks of paneer, bell peppers and lettuce. The sandwich was absolutely delicious and was just the way we like it. The fries on the other hand, were a little too oily for us.
Lastly, for dessert, we had their BakBakLava. Basically a baklava but better. The layers of this pastry were very light, buttery, generously filled with pistachio and almonds, and delicately assembled over maple syrup. It was a delight for our eyes and taste buds.
Like their ambiance, the presentation of each dish was beautiful and worth capturing. They have a good selection of music playing all the time and the staff and service is also nice.
Overall, we'd definitely recommend this place to hang out with your friends, celebrate a little something, try the mystery rooms or to just chill and unwind.",4,"2019-04-08 18:50:12",133,1051,8
"22","49129920","I personally loved the ambience of this newly opened cafe in gachibowli Hyderabad. It has the theme of masquerade party just like the name suggests. The walls are lit with Crazy decors. Coming to the food I loved the starters and the beveragesüíö Drums of heaven is my personal favorite here. The chicken was properly cooked with right amount of sauce and spices. Summer hummer was my favorite strawberry flavored refreshment which tasted a thousand bucks. There were many other yummy dishes in here which were worth the trial and also the price. I would say a cozy evening visit here with your bunch of friends or your partner wouldn't disappoint you at all. There are addons such as books and many board games and also PlayStation . The best part is this cafe is an extension to the India's most favorite mystery rooms. You can also visit the mystery rooms along with amazing food this timeüòç‚ù§Ô∏è.
The other amazing dishes I've tried here are BROWNIE SHAKE, BLUE BOOMER, DRUMS OF HEAVEN, SUMMER HUMMER, CHICKEN PULLED TACOS, CHICKEN BOLOGNESE BURGER, VIRGIN MOJITO, CHEESY FRIES, CHILLI CHICKEN. TASTE wise all were simply amazingüî•üòã

"23","32316668","Was here for the soft launch of cafe for food. As soon as your enter the premises, you can feel the grandeur and the colorful and vibrant ambience of the place is really eye catching.
The theme of the cafe is something very unique where they're trying to offer their customers an experience rather than just food. They have some interesting games likes uno,jenga, snakes and ladders,vr games and also mystery room. They also have some bestseller books in case you're an avid reader.
AMBIENCE:5/5
The ambience of the place in a nutshell is a pop of colors. The place is colorful and vibrant with every element having a quirky feel of its own. The wall arts are magnificent and illustrious. Covered with DC and marvel characters, they're a sight to behold. The place even has live IPL screening for cricket aficionados. Comfortable seating and cool bean bags accentuate the seating. The ambience is so alluring that you're spellbound and won't stop clicking around.
FOOD:5/5
Chili chicken: The chicken was tender, juicy and adequately spiced and perfect for my palate. The spice level is high, although if you're habituated to eat spicy food you might feel it little hot.
Khema pav fondue: The khema was perfectly minced and was flavorful and the pav were soft and buttered. The only suggestion would be to proportionalize the keema quantity with the pav so as not to let it go waste.
Bombastic freak shake:. This one had chocolate and brownie. It was creamy and had crumbled brownie and tested absolutely delicious.
Crispy fried chicken burger: it was served with french fries and chipotle dip and served with fresh olives and lettuce. The burger had a crispy chicken patty and cheese, laden with veggies. With every bite, you can feel the crispiness coming through giving it a nice texture, although a little mayonnaise would've been good.
Avalanche: this had lime juice mixed with mint leaves and topped with soda and sprite. The drink felt slightly strong as the leaves were crushed and mixed into it. Although refreshing, it felt slightly strong.
Summer Hummer: this mock tail had succulent flavor of litchi juice with strawberry crush and fresh cream. These are all the things i liked together. This drink was having sweetness of litchi but also had tanginess of strawberry crush and went very well with the fresh cream. It was an absolute delight and a must try.
Bar breaker: it's a classic kit kat chocolate blended with vanilla icecream. The shake was creamy and if you're a chocolate lover, this is for you. It was divine and filling. Recommended.
Nawabi ki shaan: it was chicken legs stuffed with green chillies and cheese. It was served with papad and some bell peppers and onion salad and pudina chutney on the side. The presentation was on point and was really flavoursome with the marinate really cooked well and the cheese and chilli giving you the perfect balance of flavors. Although a little more cooking time wouldn't harm. Nevertheless,a great dish.
Pulled chicken tacos: if you're a taco fan then you should definitely go for this. Served with salsa and mayonnaise on the side, it was crisp and had a filling of kidney beans and chicken topped with cheddar cheese. It made for a perfect snack and worth trying.
SERVICE: 5/5
I went on a weekend and it was teeming with people but still the place was very well managed. The service was quick and the waiters had masks of famous cartoon and comic characters which was unique. The staff is courteous and did their job well.
VALUE FOR MONEY 5/5:
The place is great value for money as it gives all round experience. You can binge, play games and have an awesome time under one roof. Also the amount charged does justice to the experience provided. A great place to hang out and chill.",5,"2019-04-07 14:55:57",42,132,10
