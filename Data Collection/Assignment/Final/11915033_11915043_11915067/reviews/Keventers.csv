The bottle was half filled when it was delivered and when told to the customer care of zomato , it was said I have consumed it half and clicked a picture , 
No action was taken inspite of the picture taken as soon as it got delivered to me",1,"2019-05-09 15:54:22",7,7,0
"15698062","Well everything tastes like vanilla thickshake here and they‚Äôre overpriced. Can do better by adding more flavour to drinks and making em taste less like sugar syrup",2,"2019-05-01 17:32:20",2,50,0
"54372212","This place is just like take away not to sit and eat here.Their is no place for parking and its just beside ratnadeep.This drink is costing around 180rs but i have not satisfied with the drink he has given mango syrup rather than mango fresh type.
That is not at all satisfactory.Next time we will surely try chocolates and other things.

"40548961","Paid ‚Çπ180 for a large cold coffee along with ‚Çπ30 extra (‚Çπ210) for extra coffee and this is what I received. 25% of the bottle was empty and seemed like it was either opened or spilled. There was no carry bag and Zomato executive was just carrying this bottle in his hand. It neither had extra coffee and tasted extremely milky and sweet. Zomato customer care as always replied saying we will make sure this never happens. But I suppose with multiple disappointing incidents with Zomato, I should stop ordering from Zomato. Also not recommending Keventers to anyone. Not worth the money. ThickShake Factory is much better.",1,"2019-04-07 16:14:15",15,6,0

FOOD: The milkshakes are just average nothing worth the hype. The once in Delhi were far better and worth the money.
Got it for the bottles, it's beautiful and the caps have nice querky quotes.
AMBIANCE: NA
COST : Not worth the price.
SERVICE : Self
PARKING: You'll find ample space to park your car or bike on the road.

And how glad am I to see a Thickshake that's actually drinkable! The consistency was much more palatable since they have lesser ice-cream. (We've been needlessly spoiled by the other brands that just overdo it).¬†
