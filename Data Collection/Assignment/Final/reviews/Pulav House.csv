"34407330","I wish i could rate even below that, we ordered from foodpanda, consecutively 2days to be rest assured before reviewing, one day, chicken dum biryani, and the other day, chicken rice, and believe me, it was worst till now in my life. I never had such a bad experience. Is it because of foodpanda offers that the food quality degraded because it was certainly not the case with the other orders we made through the same offer?",1,"2018-09-19 01:06:35",120,2509,0

"29588570","The Chilli Egg was yummy and tasty with the correct spice, but miryala Kodi vepudu spoilt the show as for the first time I have seen a miryala Kodi vepudu with gravy which is unusual, however the taste was spicy and good. ( This was my first review and gave rating 4 but now have given 1)
But the second was worst and trust me will never order again from this restaurant, as it took nearly 45mins to cook and when the food reached me it was very cold not even hot (note this hotel is just 10 mins away from my office. 1 rating for the restaurant delaying in preparation of food as mentioned by zomato executive.",1,"2018-07-06 14:11:17",13,5,0
