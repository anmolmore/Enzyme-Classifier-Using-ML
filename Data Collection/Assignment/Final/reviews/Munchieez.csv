"644896","Ordered for a Bengali veg thali along with Chilli Egg...Delivery was before time and packaging was just perfect.
Coming to the food,
the Thali was good with a variety of rice,Luchi(puri),a mixed veg,dal and a sweet..a bit less oil here and there would actually help, otherwise fine.
What I liked was the Egg Chilli...nicely marinated and fried cut pieces of egg with an amazing gravy. üëçüëç

"29256092","The folk from the truck have now moved into a restaurant in the DLF area and haven't lost even a bit of a touch on their taste and the price. The staff is pretty amazing and caring and were readily accepting the feedback. The ambiance is good considering the budget and pricing of the menu. Their menu¬†offers quite a wide variety of dishes at a very cheap cost. I ordered sweet corn soup, mixed sauce pasta, honey chili potato, noodles with manchurian¬† and they all tasted good.¬† Honey chili potato was one of the best I have had in hyderabad and would recommend you to try it here. The sizzlers are pretty amazing here. I ordered sizzling with tutti fruit and fried ice cream with hot chocolate sauce and I really loved both the dishes.",5,"2018-04-24 02:46:42",15,63,8

"31801118","On one of my visit to DLF I came across food-truck serving sizzlers .Being a sizzler-lover I decided to give this place a try.To sizzle our taste buds, we ordered Hawaiian sizzler,Green apollo fish sizzler and Oriental BBQ chicken legs.
Flavor of the Hawaiian Sizzler was spot on.Juicy grilled Pineapple on top added an enhancing dimension to the coated-tossed meat.
Flavors of fish sizzler could be improved further.
Oriental Chicken legs tasted real good.Crispy flavorful non-oily coating went real well with juicy meat.But, the smoky BBQ kick was missing.
Considering the inhibitions and quality:costing¬† ratio they are working around with, I believe they are doing a good job.crackdownflavors.com",3.5,"2018-01-06 18:25:55",121,1005,0

"34023006","I dont understand why many reviews given before me have written well!
This is one of my worst experiences ever having a sizzler.
Both me, and my partner had STOMACH ISSUES after having from here!!!!!!!!!!
The menu was quite attractive and cheap, so we decided to give it a try!
We ordered the 5 sauce mix chicken sizzler.
1. The moment the sizzler reached my place, Lord have mercy!!! the SMELL of it was too disgusting that dint allow me to try the chicken much.
2. Coming to the pieces in the chicken, there was hardly any chicken, if you closely observe in that darkness there you will see that there is a small pinch of chicken, rest is some kind of maida or something!!!!!!!!
NOW, i understood why the sizzler was cheap.
NEVER going there back!!!!!",1,"2017-12-18 18:20:33",107,226,0
"15550151","This is one of the new outlets beside my office lane. I visited this on a weekday evening. They have a quite different menu from the regulars. Sizzlers are a must try here. We have tried the five spice non veg sizzler which is spicy. You get to know it once you finish it and not while having it. Another sizzler we had was paneer. Loved the paneer sizzler. Another popular dish over here is paneer pakoda. Biryani isn't much great as one of my friend's has tried it. Friendly on pockets and must try place. I will definitely go back.",4,"2017-11-22 08:55:05",44,229,6

"36727625","This is a sizzler serving food truck with affordable cost and good ambience situated near dlf gate 3.We ordered 5spicy Chicken Sizzler,Spicy Non veg sizzler with noddles and spicy Veg Sizzler with noddles.The quality,quantity and taste of the food is price worthy.I liked ""Spicy non veg sizzler with noddles"" most.
I loved the food and especially the behaviour of the cook.I would like to visit the food truck again.",5,"2017-11-17 21:15:00",1,3,3
"48155444","With too many regular restaurants set up all over the city, if you are looking for a different ambience and taste of food, this Food Truck is a must visit for you..! ¬†Located right opposite the DLF Gachibowli building, this truck has a various options of dishes to choose from..!
Although I would suggest that Sizzlers are a ""must try"" when you are here..!¬†
Piping hot finger licking food served with 2 different sauces makes it a steal of a deal for the price you pay..! The ever friendly staff helps you in customizing your dish according to your palate..!¬†
They made sure that Vegans are done equal justice by providing multiple options in their Veg Sizzlers..!
Moving away from the regular dining style, you have an outdoor dining over here where you can make yourself comfortable in a cozy seating arrangement..!¬†
I personally loved the food and would definitely come back to this place on any given day..!

"1366361","A food truck serving sizzlers at an affordable price .
Being right opposite to where I work I had to try this one, but unfortunately it's not upto the mark.
Well the pricing is bang on , the portions are alright but there are a few things missing.
First , the sizzlers are not served with either rice or noodles. Choice of meat is what you get .
Second, the chicken was overcooked and after being on the sizzling plate for a while it was too chewy .
Third, there is a distinct lack of sauces and taste , feels you are only eating chicken pieces without any Taste.
The above observations are made on an order of triple non veg sizzler.
Triple non veg sizzler has fried chicken chunks ,fried fish chunks & 2 fried chicken lollipop pieces.
Overall , for the price ,yes it can be okayish but from Taste perspective Definitely a lot to improve.
They should include a barbeque chicken sizzler & try adding some sauce options.
