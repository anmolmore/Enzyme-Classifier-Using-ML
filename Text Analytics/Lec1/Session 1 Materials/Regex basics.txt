### Metacharacters
Twelve characters have special meanings in regular expressions: 
1. the backslash \, 2. the caret ^, 3. the dollar sign $, 4. the period or dot ., 
5. the vertical bar or pipe symbol |, 6. the question mark ?, 7. the asterisk or star *, 
8. the plus sign +, 9. the opening parenthesis (, 10. the closing parenthesis ), 
11. the opening square bracket [, and 12. the opening curly brace {. 

These special characters are often called "metacharacters". Most of them are errors when used alone.

If you want to use any of these characters as a literal in a regex, you need to escape them with a backslash. 
E.g., to match 1+1=2, the correct regex is 1\+1=2. 

### Character Class

A "character class" matches only one out of several characters. 
Use a hyphen inside a character class to specify a range of characters. E.g., [0-9] matches a single digit between 0 and 9. 
Typing a caret (^) after the opening square bracket negates the character class.

### Shorthand Character Classes

\d matches a single character that is a digit, 
\w matches a "word character" (alphanumeric characters plus underscore), and 
\s matches a whitespace character (includes tabs and line breaks).  

\t matches a tab character (ASCII 0x09), 
\r carriage return (0x0D) and 
\n for line feed (0x0A).

The dot matches a single character, except line break characters.

### Anchors
Anchors do not match any characters. They match a position. 
^ matches at the start of the string, and $ matches at the end of the string.
E.g. ^b matches only the first b in bob.

\b matches at a word boundary. A word boundary is a position between a character that can be matched by \w and a character that cannot be matched by \w.

###Alternation
Alternation is the regular expression equivalent of "or". E.g., cat|dog matches cat in About cats and dogs.

Alternation has the lowest precedence of all regex operators. cat|dog food matches cat or dog food. 
To create a regex that matches cat food or dog food, you need to group the alternatives: (cat|dog) food.

### Repetition
The question mark makes the preceding token in the regular expression optional. E.g., colou?r matches colour or color.

The asterisk or star tells the engine to attempt to match the preceding token zero or more times. 
The plus tells the engine to attempt to match the preceding token once or more. 
E.g., <[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*> matches an HTML tag without any attributes. <[A-Za-z0-9]+> is easier to write but matches invalid tags such as <1>.

Use curly braces to specify a specific amount of repetition. 
E.g., Use \b[1-9][0-9]{3}\b to match a number between 1000 and 9999. 
\b[1-9][0-9]{2,4}\b matches a number between 100 and 99999.

### Grouping and Capturing

Place parentheses around multiple tokens to group them together. You can then apply a quantifier to the group. 
E.g., Set(Value)? matches Set or SetValue.
