"77073520","Hey friends! I ordered spicy chicken steamed momos and veg steamed momos. The veg momos were not so appealing in taste..it was average. However, the chicken momos were good. Worth price. The sauce needs improvement again..üòÖ
The experience was not completely bad. Worth money that's all I can say. ",3,"2019-04-27 17:37:24",5,0,2
"50931643","Ordered Chicken Spicy Momos and Chicken n Onion Momos through Swiggy. Packaging was perfect.
Comming to the taste, the Onion n Chicken momos tasted a little bland and the Spicy Chicken Momos were more of a spicy version of onion chicken momos. Overall they were just ok, not a fan of these though. ",3,"2019-04-03 18:29:50",74,64,1
"101909211","Ordered Chicken Popcorn and Veg. Machurian roll. Packing is good. But, instead of Veg manchurian we got Cheese roll and the taste is very disappointing. Coming to chicken popcorn it smelled like it had done 3 days back. The food is horrible.
PS: My suggestion is don't order the food from Snack Point. If you visit the place and have food there and itself it will be a best option.",1,"2019-03-22 15:59:48",1,0,0
"60145149","I've ordered...
Spicy burger - 3.5/5 which wasn't spicy at all...anyways it tasted good, bun was very thick.
Panneer kadai roll(cheese as add on) - 3/5 very oily(not cheese nor butter)...thick roti borders,not spicy was just 'ok'",3,"2019-03-19 18:41:57",16,1,1

"2852822","Hey guys , it is me again. So, today's restraturant is Snack Time. I have ordered couple of things from here like burger , potato pops an wedges, French fries. So, coming to point, I rate this restraturant in terms of food quality is 3.5 üåü for me . It can be better but considering prices. It is tasty enough to experience ample quality in making of food and it tastes good in your mouth. Coming to quantity, you guys really need to take note of this that quantity is so less. Don't get foolled by Quantity they mentioned in menu coz when you actually see your order they you will realise how quantity be. So, for that reason I gave 3 üåü. And packing of food and hygiene I will give 3 üåü again , it should be again better but it is credible enough to consider this rating so overall is 3.5 üåü but Zomato doesn't have feature to give 3.5 üåü rating so I gave 4 üåü to this coz I think 3 üåü might be injustice to restraturant from me..ok..See you guys at next reviews..Eat hard and party harder...",4,"2018-05-20 12:46:02",58,356,1
