"46058919","Ordered banana honey oats parfait. No trace of honey, not a single piece of pomegranate, namesake topping of banana, little oats at the bottom. The lid of the jar in which the food came in looked  as if it was used as an ashtray. Scam place. Never again.",1,"2018-03-13 14:53:46",4,5,0

"36744448","I have had the worst of experience couple of times with InnerChef. I was really amazed to see such pathetic service and food from them. I ordered desserts last night through Zomato. First of all the order arrived after 2 hours. We lost hope and we couldn't reach anyone from their team. This was not the first time I faced this problem. The same thing happened few days back when I ordered from Healthie, another InnerChef brand.
Coming to the food part, they didn't fail to meet my expectations. The food was pathetic. The brownie was stale. The shakes were hot. BTW, they again missed to give complete order (again). They missed one of the shakes. Although I didn't bother to call them again for that as the shakes were really bad.
I would recommend everyone to not order from this place. Thank You InnerChef for your services. I hope either you shut down soon or start from scratch as you guys have got nothing right apart from fancy packaging which is pointless.",1,"2018-03-09 12:26:59",6,2,0
