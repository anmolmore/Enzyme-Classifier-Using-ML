"37532726","Okay okay kind of place. The food is good here. The service though is a matter of concern. The rates seem reasonable and not over priced. Ambience is something which they may never have heard of. Ambience in the restaurant is like one could literally feel to just walk away from the place. The interiors aren't great, aren't well lit and the decoration seems to be over done. Can visit, but only if you like the loneliness.",3,"2019-01-27 19:10:41",7,63,0

"58781499","The food quality and taste is sub par.. we ordered pav bhaji , dahi papdi, rabdi falooda and chocolate thick shake. Dahi papdi was too watery. Rabdi Falooda had only broken noodles, no rabdi, just watery roohafza milk with tasteless broken noodles filled till brim.. Pav bhaji was tastes like pumpkin bhaji, and they did t bother to add even lemon to it. They need to improve highly on taste of they plan to stay open.. ",2,"2018-11-24 19:03:42",2,0,0
"2369976","Have been to Cusino multiple times, specially late evening. Lots of open space and ample place for my kids to play around :) (That is always a ➕). A big projection screen makes the ambience a few notches better.
Food's quality is descent and is definitely pocket friendly. You also have whole range of options available there including Indian, Chinese, Arabian, Chats, Thick shakes etc.
Thumbs up for the place. Prefer visiting late evenings!",4,"2018-11-07 16:04:30",40,116,0
"44603526","We have visited this restaurant. Ordered few items and one if the item was paneer chatpata. It was so tangy that we couldn't eat and we did complaint. The manager was not even ready to waive that item off. We paid for the item which we didn't eat. Think twice before visiting this restaurant. ",1,"2018-11-04 23:38:17",15,1,0
"33722272","This is my go to place for dinner directly from office for anything and everything. They serve amazing French fries which is why I keep visiting here. I had tried their Chinese and Indian menu and feel that their Chinese is better to taste. My personal favourite is burnt garlic noodles. The quantity served for all dishes are good for 2 at times a bit more actually. The ambience is pretty simple with a big screen to enjoy all the live matches. I have heard that their pizza is good and am yet to try that. They are not so great with biriyanis for sure and the service is a bit slow. 
In a nutshell, a pocket friendly casual dining place with decent taste and quality. ",4,"2018-09-30 12:57:23",118,770,0

"39638836","VERY BAD! They are adding Non Veg even to vegetarian dishes. We were a team of 5 vegetarians. We ordered Veg Manchurian and Crispy Veg. We could sense the taste of Egg in Crispy Veg, we called the incharge. He was very rude and said its obvious that egg would be added in all the items there as it is a Veg and Non Veg restaurant which made no sense. He did not even apologize for mixing Non Veg but argued saying in entire city in every restaurant.. There wont be a single dish without adding non veg. ",1,"2018-09-25 13:55:53",1,1,0

"311505","Being in the vicinity of Deloitte and opened late at night sort of gives them the license to charge whatever they feel like. 250 rs for chilli chicken/manchurian? Who are you competing with? China Bistro? Or the roadside noodle center? None actually, as this place has carved out a separate niche for itself viz. Being costly and absolutely not tasty. We charge you for being close to your expensive workplace. We charge you for your midnight hunger pangs. Absolute disappointment.",2,"2018-08-29 09:46:32",140,929,0

"5941351","This place is a life saver for people working on mindspace Rd, Gachibowli. It's ambience is super awesome. It has a super huge space inside with a big projctor aided screen to enjoy TV and loud music. It's a big yes if you are a big group and want to hang out for lunch and dinner.
Their Chinese is the best so far in all the food that I have tried here. And You do get all varieties of food and you won't be left disappointed. My personal favourite is the thick shakes that they provide.
But be mindful of the price. Though you will not be disappointed with the ambience but the food doesn't come cheap. Sometimes you would feel the items pricy.
My suggestion to them would be to improve their momo quality. I really hated them.
Overall, guys do go here and enjoy.",5,"2018-07-14 15:36:29",22,32,4

Veg Fried Momos we're under cooked/fried. Couple of Momos were watery and could say this a pretty bad dish.
Main course - Kaju Curry was good but some what highly sweet. Can be spiced up a more. Chicken chettinadu was also good. Rotis and Butter Naan asusual. ",3,"2018-06-06 11:43:12",91,177,3

Service - Extremely slow, the staff is not really well spoken, don't implement the customisation to the food.
Ambience - They have a big tv screen, playing good bollywood songs, so a 1* for that!
Food - The north indian is very spicy, and the paneer had no taste. The service coordination for sending the breads and sabzis was so bad that we ended up eating cold food. Coming to the south indian, how can someone manage to serve a cold dosa! unbelievable.

The Chinese food is great, while Lebanese (Shawarma stuffs) needs to be avoided. Indian Maincoruse is good, so is south-Indian (Pizza Dosa).

"133955","With a sudden spurt of drive-ins around Hyderabad, Cusino stands out for me for its overall ambience, food and service quality. The seating is very comfortable and the giant screen playing music videos is a plus. 
The food options available are very good and I've not came back unhappy or disappointed once so far. I've had biryani, chats, sizzlers, south Indian and burgers there. Their chicken leg biryani was awesome with 2 big leg pieces. The chole bhature tasted well and the south Indian options are also very good. They have an outlet of The Original Shawarma which serves very less quantity there compared to home delivery orders.
The service is super quick and staff very courteous.

When asked how much time, they didn’t have an answer. We got disappointed and ordered shawarma and fries. It would take 10 mins they said at 9:08. We waited until 9:20 yet no luck. We asked for the reason for delay. The host unbelievably said ‘khana hai tho khao warna Nahi’. We lost it here! We canceled the order and left. All they have is idli dosa and biryanis hahaha it’s a food mess under the skin of a posh drive inn. Relax and have good food somewhere else.

I have been watching this space starting from the day land is getting cleared to the day it was turned into a beautiful food court .. Though it’s just few clicks away from my workplace was never able to make it for unknown reasons & Finally payed a visit ..!
Cusino shares its space effectively (kind of drive in) with Swadist, Khatta meetha chat, Freshies, Tempteys , Mucho, gusto, The original shawarama, Berrylicious which allows you to choose from many options available..! 
Ambience is pretty much a Semi open type seating with songs running on large screen..! (Can be an option for cricket fans)
As I was already prepared to have sandwich ordered Veggie Club Sandwich from #MuchoGusto.. while my order arrives what else a foodie does.. click pics of ambience and suddenly bunch of people rounded me (as if I came for inspection ) & was not asked to take clicks of the food court..  they don’t want to reveal the actual reason though..! Upon questioning one of the reason they said was people were copying their ambience.. & I am like what should star hotels do then 🤦🏻‍♂️..
Finally sandwich arrived & tasted okay.. could have been better if the bread was crisp .. French fries 🍟 accompanied were good and fresh lime soda was refreshing..!
Overall bill 160₹

"5242111","This food court which is situated right beside Deloitte is a frequent hangout place for my Friends, though I never visited this place earlier, today we went to have breakfast here, food quality is average, waiting time is more, we ordered one Wada and a masala dosa, in menu they indicated price for 2 wadas is 40, but in the bill they charged 40 rupees for single Wada, when we raised the issue to cashier, they said in their billing software they don't have a provision for single items, they can't do any thing now, we're not in a mood to altercate, so we left the place,  the problem is not 20 rupees or other but the attitude towards customer.",2,"2018-01-07 13:48:31",9,30,0
