"93838475","Ordered a milkshake thru ZOMATO and the Milkshakes tastes bad and they do also have some plastic papers inside. Very much disappointed with them. ",1,"2019-05-03 11:39:31",4,1,0
"36262451","Visited this place more than couple of times, except kitkat shake and brownie shake nothing seems good over here. I would rather prefer thickshake factory or a thickshake from creamstone. One time visit place that's it..",3,"2019-03-26 17:48:14",58,58,1
"51145419","I ordered Belgium dark chocolates thickshake .. but quality was not upto the mark ... Quality was very poor and thickness also very less ... We need to improve more .... ",2,"2019-02-18 23:46:20",38,28,1
"1853730","It's not a milkshake, it's an extremelyyyy thick shake and you'll have to eat like an ice cream!!!
Ordered 2 shakes - caramel 5-star and oreo Nutella.
Both of them tasted good and surprisingly tasted the same as well!! 🙄
The caramel used was soft and not crunchy.
Suggest you to improvise on the texture and the proportions of the ingredients...
Also, there were a hell lot of mosquitoes, please maintain hygiene!! ",3,"2018-11-08 16:04:35",61,261,2
"53228470","Extremely poor service. Ignorant and neglected behavior towards customers. The bill of an order is the most basic item in any retail purchase/transaction. Unfortunately Milkshake Buffin, Staff, Management do not care about customers. No bill provided even after repeated requests. The owner over the phone blatantly refused and said ""we do not give the invoice to the customer as we have not got the required regulations in place and they are under process"" I was promised verbally over the phone that the bill would be emailed next morning. However, this never happened. How is this for treatment towards the customer? ",1,"2018-10-18 23:01:33",1,6,1
"41556306","Ordered online from this place. Their packaging brought a smile to our faces. The milkshakes were also tasty, but the 5 stars to presentation :) ",5,"2018-10-01 23:28:26",1,20,1
"50863981","I booked two milkshakes from neaybuy app but they took extra money by telling that price list is not updated. I ordered 2 walnut and Ferrero Rocher milkshake but they gave both  Ferrero Rocher milkshake. 
In terms of taste, it is good and it more tastes like thickshake. 
Quantity: 1 milkshake is sufficient for 1 person",2,"2018-09-28 11:31:49",30,32,0

A must try if you  are around this place, to make a note this is very near to ORR and you can quickly grab and vanish into the long drives.  Strawberry Banana is my all time favourite. The staff is very pleasant and i am glad that I found this one near to my home. Highly recommended.",5,"2018-05-20 22:02:20",39,158,0
