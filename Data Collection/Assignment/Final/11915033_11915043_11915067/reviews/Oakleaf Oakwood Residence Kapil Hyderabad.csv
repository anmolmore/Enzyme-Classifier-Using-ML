"1575466","Went for a team lunch to this place. And we were tempted by the rating in zomato. The ambience of this place very peacefully and lovely. It looked like they dont expect to be visited by a team for lunch and it showed in their serving skills.
They started with starters which are not many and we were fully aware of it. The starters were great and tasted very light. Main source is good for a person like me who likes not so spicy food. Special mention for the salads,they were really awesome. Even the deserts were too good. All in all the food was great if you like not so spicy cuisine and the only frustrating part of the visit was the serving time.

"73328891","One of the finest restaurant in Hyderabad 
Taste was really good 
We went for dinner buffet 
They served 2 veg and 2 non veg starters those are niceMain course was okay .. some of the items in was yummy
Salads and desserts are lip smacking 
One thing is food cards are not acceptable here this was only drawback about this place ",5,"2019-05-10 21:33:25",10,0,5

Me and my friend had dinner buffet on 1 plus one offer of Dineout passport. Throughly enjoyed the food. One of the rare times, Mai course is as good as starters.
Please offer more starters and desserts. ",5,"2019-03-07 21:22:02",20,21,4

"30307683","In terms of Stay, Oakwood is amazing.As they have a service apartments,lot of facilities are there and it was pretty wonderful experience. Breakfast is also amazing and lot of diverse options are there in it.
This time I went for the Buffet lunch with my team and we were really disappointed.First of all there are only 2 Veg starters and 1 Non Veg starter.At price of 850 for buffet,only 2 starters are just not acceptable.
Also we had to ask multiple times for starters.
In terms of varieties,they have only focused on salads as there are numerous options in it.
Veg starter
Chilli paneer (3/5)
Cheese balls (4.5/5)
In main course,there were various gravy options,noodles,Dahi bhalle and varieties of salad.
Dahi bhalle and kadhai paneer were good but noodles were not.
In dessert,they had  
Eclairs Praline (1/5)
Eclairs part was very hard,which instead of adding the flavour to it just destroyed the whole taste of it.
Raspberry palm on sandwich (4/5)
It was quite unique. Basically it was kind of a cream roll but in a different packaging.
Coconut pie (4/5)
Orange Pound cake (3/5)
Chocolate Cream caramel (1/5)
Strawberry pastry (didn't try)
Gulab Jamun (4.5/5)
They also serve Chocolate,Vanilla, and butterscotch ice cream.
Overall a nice ambiance to enjoy your food but definitely overpriced in terms of quality as well as quantity",3,"2019-01-21 17:29:27",179,1874,7
"1710740","Good food and a relaxing Sunday lunch buffet. Starters are limited with 2 veg and 1 non veg option however the veg salad section was a revelation. Like the green beans in creamy dressing, crunchy and mildly sweet. Main course and desserts had some good options - mango eclairs and raspberry pastry being highlights. Service is good and the staff very patient. ",4,"2019-01-20 18:40:16",54,271,0

The restaurant is in 3rd floor which is really nice to have some quality time with your friends. Coming to the food, the spread is not so huge but it is having the decent amount of varieties with all the trimmings.
The attendants were very friendly and liked the hospitality.",5,"2019-01-06 06:51:06",32,3052,12
"29165690","Had been to this place for lunch on weekdays! Very less crowd had a peaceful time. They had only 2 varieties of starters for vegetarians ( potato poppers and crispy baby corn) both of which was very tasty. But, they can increase the number of starters for vegetarians. In main course, they had lot of curry options available but they kept only tawa roti(plain and butter). Desserts were okay(pastries, Gulab jamun).",3,"2018-12-15 19:38:19",18,10,6

"1027434","We went for dinner buffet on Sunday, hence this review is for the buffet spread.
The food is delicious and the spread had a lot of variety. If one wants to indulge is gluttony this is not the place to be. The variety is healthy in nature and doesn't overburden your senses. The crem brulee was delicious and stood out for me. The hospitality and service were impeccable. The ambience was also good, the only minor complaint might be regarding the tables being slightly small. But this was compensated by the amazing service provided by clearing plates quickly to create space. Overall the very enjoyable experience.",5,"2018-12-10 11:33:53",6,6,0

"8673681","I visited Oakleaf for lunch buffet on a saturday afternoon. This place is located right next to Kapil towers in financial district. They have around 150 premium service apartments and this restaurant is located on the 3rd floor.
The ambiance of this place is quite decent and comfortable. The staff was also welcoming.
Starters were served at the table. They offered only 3 starters - 2 veg and 1 non-veg. In veg, they had potato bullets and a crispy starter which had vegetable filling inside. In non-veg, they offered chicken tikka. The starters very average. I was expecting a much wider range here.
For the main course, they had a huge spread of salads, I liked the Fried Fish with lemon dressing salad and the Kachumber salad. They had 2 soup offerings - pumpkin soup and chicken soup. Moving on, I also tried noodles with fish & scallion gravy. This gravy was delectable. From the veg section, i liked Paneer nilgiri korma. They also served Subz Kolhapuri, Aloo Vepudu, Dal Tadka, Exotic vegetables with Schedwan sauce and Biryani. These dishes were decent. 
The desserts section had a good variety of pastries and other sweets. But this section disappointed me. Only the Lauki Halwa was somewhat good.",3,"2018-11-24 16:35:18",75,365,13

If you already like steak , you must try it out here too.
I tried a la carte but I suggest everyone to try the buffet here which is cheaper and offers more options.",4,"2018-11-11 20:23:11",93,767,6
"33137836","Went there for a dinner buffet. Its in the 3rd floor of the Oakwood Residency.
The starters were good. They serve the starters , so you may have to ask around a few times if you want to repeat any starter. 
They have loads of salads and condiments. 
The variety cheese and breads they serve are pretty fresh. The main course was a little too ""Indian"" as opposed to the continental feel they have set for the rest of the buffet.  
The dessert was same as any other buffet place(cakes and gulab jamun).
The ambiance was homely and staff were courteous and helping.

This was followed by the mains - Bharti Vangi, Misal Pav and Vegetable Xacuti. My personal favourite though was the Kaju Chi amti with Flavored rice. 
Ended this sit down 4 course meal with a beautifully plated Olya Naralchi Karanji with sorbet. ",4,"2018-10-31 23:06:34",66,435,5

They had a lavish spread ranging from Indian breakfast dishes (both north and south )to continental, including a live counter for dosa, omlette, pancakes, waffles etc.
Loved the arrangements and the service as well.
Staff were courteous , polite and very helpful.
Would love to come back here to try out their lunch/dinner buffet.

The food was very average, choices were minimal, only 2 veg starters in Rs. 880 buffet.
I'd rather recommend some small eatery which offers cheap buffet, it'll still be better.

"1627427","This was Friday the 13th and birthday of a very special friend. We had an instant plan to meet up at Oakleaf for the dinner buffet. For me, buffets always goes a bit overhead since I can not eat as much I talk about food and brag about being a real foodie. That is also the reason that I form my opinion basis the quality more than the quantity most often. However, Oakleaf buffet was so awesome that I almost eat double my appetite. Not just the taste but the spread was something I had not found in any buffet before. And this was the first Baba Ghanoush I had. I cannot comment on the authenticity of the taste but I indeed liked the mashed eggplant. And those lovely breads with butter .. I had so much of them, you may call me insane! The starters were served on the table, main course was decent (though I tried very lil) and lip smacking desserts made my tummy too tight.

"31801118","I decided to visit Oakwood for a breakfast on a weekend along with my family.
Spread had impressive balance of indian and continental breakfast options.They also had quite good spread of fruits , cold cuts and cereals.
Basket bread :
In my opinion, folks at Oakleaf/Cafe115 never leave me disappointed when it comes to the quality of bread they offer.All the variants of bread in the buffet spread were exceptionally good.
Croissants  and muffins tasted real good.
Salads: DIY
Salad dressings were flavorful and light.Honey mustard had to be my personal pick.
Roasted tomatoes were pretty good
Live Counter : 
Pancake was fluffy and perfectly made .
Sausages and bacon were decent.
Humble french toast was addictive.
Uttapam was undercooked.
Different variants of eggs were done pretty well.
Indian:
Of all the indian breakfast options, Pongal had to be the unquestionable winner. 
Sambar and chutney were packed with homely flavor.
Drinks:
Of all the drink,mango milkshake was pretty disappointing.

I liked almost everything from the word go. We were promptly attended and service was good throughout. While soups and starters are good, I just fell in love with salads. Main course was good with many options. Desserts section can have few more eggless options and this is one area which can be improved. I used my gourmet offer which made it more than worth.

Most of the items were really bland in taste in the starter category
For main course - Not a lot of variety available, going by the fact that it is a buffet. Not good taste wise too
Desserts - For me this is the real crowd puller in buffets, no attractions here too

"125714","Recent surge in my work have limited my review sessions. Before I was leaving for Brisbane, Oakwood had extended an invite for an exclusive preview of their upcoming menu. I was unsure whether to take it up, but their PR and Chef promised me an extraordinary experience. A different menu was curated after considering my dietary preferences and at the end it accounted for a top-notch experience. 
Oakleaf, in-house Restaurant of Oakwood Residence Kapil Towers offers well-known dishes from the global cuisine. They have a Bar counter too and have been informed that their barman stirs up best of the Sangrias, Cocktails and Mocktails. The ambiance is classy, up-scale and evokes a calm-down feel sufficient to relieve the tensed and stressed corporates. Being a Service Apartment, the in-house guests form their majority of clienteles and the menu offers a good range of Intercontinental fares. 
I am penning down this review after a long time but my memories are still fresh as one can’t simply forget a good meal and a conversation. The pickled olives and jalapenos crostini was the right bite to start off the meal. What followed next was another light appetizer “Karari Roomali” seasoned with spicy masala and fresh chopped tomatoes, cucumbers and green chilies.
Switching over to some heavy and more flavorful starters, there was “Hara Bhara Kebab” sent out by Chef in one of the most innovative presentation which involved the very basic ingredients. The goodness of greens in a lip smacking avatar packed a punch of flavors and was non-greasy. “Span-uh-koh-pi-tuh” (Spanakopita) was a delicious revelation of Greek savory triangles. The golden crust phyllo encased a gooey, melt in the mouth filling and was an instant hit.
After the plethora of starters, Rituparna (PR) obliged to my request quite hesitantly for a simple main course and ordered “Paneer Kulcha” with “Paneer Methi Malai”. The stuffing was mildly seasoned and the Kulcha was silken-soft. Undoubtedly the best I have ever had.  The curry was an excellent preparation of cottage cheese in a creamy cashew gravy dotted with fenugreek leaves. It was a rich embodiment of creaminess and subtle flavors.
The Choco-Lava, so impressively done and beautifully plated, I couldn’t take my eyes off and admire the novelty of the Chef. Moist brownie alike cake with oh-so-ooey-gooey liquid chocolate in the middle and besieged by exotic fruits. Could the session end on a better note? I doubt!
Pricing is similar to fine dining restaurants. The staff is attentive, wearing smile all the time. So next time you want to elevate your clients/team members taste-buds and add some spice to business lunches/dinner, Oakleaf would not only make it better but will also provide the needed personal space for serious discussions as well.",4,"2018-05-21 21:57:19",149,1676,15

"34715433","One of the finest dining restaurants in Hyderabad .Situated inside the oakwood residency in financial district . Prime location with mnc’s surrounding it , hence easy to reach . Food is really appetising and presentation was on point . Caesar salad was scrumptious , but the lasagne I had was okayish .

"4502511","Situated inside the Oakwood Residency in Financial District, Gachibowli is this swanky and high end restaurant catering to early morning buffs who would aim at getting the best quality breakfast spread at decent prices. 
The entrance is quite like the one of a 4 star hotel, there is bag checking and parking valet with musical lifts :D The moment I entered Oakleaf , I was way too excited to pick my area of grabbing and gulping as the spread was rather wide and sure enough any breakfast person cannot in this span of 2-4 hours gulp down two portions of each item. There was ham, pork, bacons, salami, sausages with all sorts of sauces and sorting. There was a good spread of flavoured yoghurts and dry fruits in small adorable jars. The breads were available in brown , white and miltigrain and there was Nutella and Peanut Butter along with jams of different flavours too. 
You could order parantha with curd or pancakes with your choice of syrup and the juices were just too fresh and pulpy. Tea or coffee or a different flavour juice would be served to you on your table at the drop of a hat. The presentation is amazing and so is the hospitality. The cost of buffet is quite reasonable and they would also offer corporate discount which is bonus.
The food was sumptuous and delectable and I was filled to the brim of my appetite so much so that along with my group, we decided to sit there for a while in the outside seating to just bake in the sun and feel a tad dizzy with relaxation and slumber. After all, I truly believe that good food does get the best of you and hit your high in a way nicer than alcohol.

Also, not many would understand my sarcasm. Moving on towards the main content of my article, Oakleaf. This side of the city has very few fine-dining places and it really is a matter of concern. We need more of such pretty looking, good food serving, apt for candle-light-dinner restaurants in this part of the city. Also, I loved the fact that unlike many other hotels, the restaurant is not situated next to the lobby or the entrance thereby reducing the hustle. The view from Oakleaf is beautiful, especially at night! I was floored totally as soon as I entered....Read full post on fifatra.in",4.5,"2017-10-12 15:12:48",NA,898,0

Oakleaf, the all-day dining restaurant at @oakwood.residence.kapil.hyd launches its all-new menu and a brilliant one at that. Was there recently and I had a blast!

More of a buffet place with main importance on Residence services. Has a really nice pool. Ambience is great. The staff is courteous and very professional. 
Coming to the food, the Chicken starter was good. Along with the Steamed fish. They also have very well cooked Cantonese styled Veggies. Really liked it. The Bread along with the cheese and butter was very good. 
In desserts the blueberry Panna Cotta was good. 
One bad thing that turned me off was that I found a strand of hair in the Mutton Pulav.

I trusted his feelings about this place and agreed for lunch. This place is good, so was the food... but honestly, I recommend this place for meeting-over-lunch. Made me feel quite formal and wasn't comfortable eating just anything out there. I had to keep looking at the food for quite some time and pick one to eat! Maybe my bad..
I won't argue on how others feel about this place and food, bcz this is just my opinion. Could be good for you!

The pasta was something similar - was tasting a little indian but again in a good way.  On the drinks side my friends liked Rum Rickey out of all the cocktails.
In the buffet - the selection is limited and served to table. But they have a wide variety of salads and cheese to make up for the limited starter section.
They have a live pasta counter and the main course is a decent spread. The desserts again is limited but overall taste of all the dishes were good.",4,"2016-07-20 08:33:10",31,49,0
"11939621","Oakleaf is multi-cuisine restaurant sited amidst the famous Oakwood Residence Kapil Towers at Gachibowli. It’s already been a year since it started and has managed to garner attention mainly because it is located around the IT sector. 
The restaurant serves various cuisines like Continental, Italian, Asian and the likes. I must say the food is pretty much decent and a few definitely stand out. The interiors are beautifully done and I personally loved the paintings that were hung up on the walls. There’s an outdoor seating area as well that overlooks the entire Gachibowli area and would certainly make for a pleasant evening along with a cuppa coffee or chai!
I was invited for a bloggers table last week to try their buffet spread. We were seated along with their Executive Chef Brijesh Kumar who filled us in with all the details on the buffet. It’s always a pleasure to have a chef come and explain all about the food and works behind it.
We were first served the Mushroom Cappuccino which apparently is the chef’s signature dish and it was warm and welcoming. Also tried the Blue Bangle mocktail that was bang on taste wise making it thoroughly refreshing!
Next came up the starters which I must mention were a little disappointing, considering starters usually are the ones that taste best compared to the main course in various restaurants. But here it was the other way around! Main course was way better.
Bharwaan Mushroom Ka Kebab was just an average dish that had the mushroom stuffed with cheese and a few spices.
Prawns Fritters are usually everyone’s favorite kinda food because who doesn’t like deep fried food!? But unfortunately the prawns here were way too salty and the batter was very thick which turned it into an unpleasant experience.
Stir Fried Lamb was decent as the lamb was tender and the veggies served along with it in an Asian sauce were just fine. The taste overall was mild and not too strong.
Teriyako Chicken Skewers tasted fabulous! The chicken was tossed in teriyaki sauce which made the chicken taste divine. Certainly a good dish.
Dalcha Gosht is known to be a famous hyderabadi dish and I have literally grown up hogging on this one! The mutton was soft n tender immersed in the delicious dal which went well with plain white rice.
Gongura Mamsam was tangy and the mutton again was tender and wonderful. It was served along with a few rotis/parathas.
Gaeng kiow wahn is a Thai red curry that’s vegetarian. Curries made in coconut gravy are always tempting and delightful and so was this one that was served with plain white rice.
Dum Ka Murgh at first I thought was haleem, because the colour and the fried onions garnished on top looked very similar! I would call this the star of the show for it’s “oh so deliciousness!” the spices and the gravy along with the succulent chicken was to die for. I can definitely go back there just for this one dish! I personally haven’t tasted such flavorful dum ka murg in quite some time. Full marks for this one!
Grilled Polenta with wild mushroom Fricassee is a continental dish that’s made from polenta served along with rich mushroom sauce. An absolute delight!
After the heartwarming main course it was time for deserts. I would say it was nothing extra ordinary but the usual pastries and the likes. I liked the Kiwi Delight and the rest weren’t much to talk about. It would be nice if they could work on the desert section a little more.
Overall paying around 650 per person is a pretty good option for it’s variety in the buffet spread, quick service and aesthetically designed interiors.",3.5,"2016-07-15 01:17:21",34,154,0

Oakleaf, The all-day dinning restaurant which has specialty in North Indian, Continental, Italian food at Oakwood Residence - Kapil Tower had made a name by serving delectable cuisine.  I was invited over a blogger tables to experience buffet and few signature dishes of Chef Brijesh.  
The classy ambience and well trained staff draw my attention as soon as I entered. I like Oakleaf’s stylish interior which shows class of restaurant. 
The newly open bar has pretty decent option in cocktail and mocktail section.  We tried Tae Off and Blue Bangle which was refreshing drink to start with. 
In Soup section, Chef’s choice was Mushroom Cappucino. The garlic flavoured mushroom soup with creamy froth won my heart in one sip and I acknowledge by saying “WOW” to chef Brijesh. The perfect blend of ingredient and mildness of rosemary sprinkled on cappuccino was simply one of the best soup I have tried in recent time.  The signature dish of chef and FoodieXP’s recommendation. 
Bharawan mushroom ke kebab which has stuffing of cheese with indian spices and cooked in tandoor was good. Teriyako Chicken Skewers was next dish which has meritnation of Teriyako sauce on chicken was bang on the taste.  Prawns Fritters was little bit salty and bit thick coating didn’t impress me much. Stir fried lamb was also served which my foodie friends liked. 
Char kway teow, a popular Malaysia Singapore dish which was made with flat rice noddle with bunch of sea food proportion was not up to the mark and lacks perfection. 
Grilled polenta with wild mushroom fricassee was really show stopper. The polenta and mushroom base sauce was simply outstanding. This dish was something new for me and it impress me with its flavours. Grilled polenta with wild mushroom fricassee is FoodieXP’s recommendation.
Well know Thai dish Gaeng kiow wahn (Thai Veg Red Curry)  with steam rice was awesome combination.  The balance of spices with coconut milk and cream was outstanding. 
Dum Kar Murgh – Chicken marinated in a host of spices and slow cooked on a dum was delicious.  Famous Hyderabadi dish “Dalcha ghost” and famous Andhra speciality “Gongura mamsam” was favourites among lamb and mutton lovers. 
I took glance of Buffet which include Pan Asia and continental dishes and decided to pick up few dishes from Buffet.
A glass of Mint Lagoon was refreshing drink and defiantly a decent welcome drink.
In buffet there were 6+ options in salad section. That includes Greek Salad , Tossed Basa Fish Salad , Chicken Coleslaw Salad , Sliced Egg with mustered dressing and Pasta Salad. Each salad justify it’s ingredient and give distinguish experience. I really like variation in this section , flavours and freshness.  Yes…I am salad lovers and was happy to see variety and options. 
I liked Dahi Bhala and Chana Sev Chaat gives that typical indian tangy chaat taste. 
In Main Course there were good amount of options and I decide tried Vegetable in Hot Garlic Sauce , Barbeque Tossed Cottage Cheese ,Paneer Labbadar, Vegetable Korma, Fish in Black Bean Sauce ,Rosted Chicken with Rosemary Sauce, Curried Spice Grilled Fish…honesty speaking all dishes were perfect but few outstanding were Paneer Labbadar , Rosted Chicken with Rosemary and Grilled Fish.  Just loves these three dishes.  I skip Chicken Biryani as I wanted to keep some room for dessert. 
Check Exclusive Video of few dishes @ my Blog.
Buffet’s dessert section offers single serving size 6+ desserts.Kiwi Delight, Applie Pie and Mocha Pastry standout in Buffet’s dessert section.
Buffet which is priced at 580 + Taxes offers Continental, Pan Asia cuisine and famous local dishes. I was really satisfied with quality, taste and variety it offers and highly recommend it.

I had my boss visiting me and i was keen on taking her to fine dining. OakLeaf was one place on the list as i did hear about it being a great example of good food and a good hotel.
We started with drinks and talk of the town dishes such as Chilli Wok Fish, Paneer tikka and Chicken 65. They were all great, tasted fresh and surprisingly not blant at all! For main course we kept it simple by ordering a white sauce pasta and chicken schezwan noodles. I did not get a chance to taste the noodles but the pasta was delicious!! Not just food being the main attraction, there were other factors too that greatly influenced our dining experience one of which was the staff being attentive and asking us if we were having a good time there.

Oakleaf which has specialty in North Indian, Continental, Italian food at Oakwood Residence Kapil Hyderabad in a year time had made a name by serving delectable cuisine. Chef Brijesh Kumar had very thought cocktail dinner designed for First Anniversary Event.
The bartender serves Cocktails , mocktails , sophisticated red and white wines. The Bar section has lots of variety and I observer that bartender makes all popular and signature drinks with perfection with any effort. Guest enjoyed drinks by keeping bartender busy in serving variety of cocktails and mocktails during the event.Beverages are incomplete without great starters, prawns and tandoori chicken was made with perfection and Veg Manchurian was favourite among us.
The salad section has tons of variety which includes Indian and few international dishes. The standout salad was “Salad Caprese” and “Sea Food Salad”. Cheese Board with Nuts was another popular dish.
I must say Main Course was delicious and all dishes were made with perfection. In veg section, Vegetable Thai Curry and Lagan Ke Paneer was show stopper and in non veg section,Herb Gratinated Fish Steak, Butter Chicken and Shepherd Pie was simply lip smashing. Herb Gratinated Fish Steak wins the show stopper spot with narrow margin to Butter Chicken and Shepherd Pie. Potato Gnocchi with cheese Mushroom Fondue was another favourite among many foody friends.
I give full credit to Chef Brijesh Kumar for his expertise in North Indian, Continental and Italian cuisine. 
Desert section covers Sandesh, Kalikanda Khaja, Nutty Bar, Kurbani ka Mitta,Jambun , Brownee.The Kolkata special Sandesh was awesome and a bangaoli foody friend liked it a lot. Nutty Bar , Jambun and brownie was perfect for my sweet tooth.
My Food Experience was awesome and I highly recommend Oakleaf for its Bar and Food specially North Indian, Continental and Italian cuisine. 
Chef and Management talked about future plan and event which ensure that guest will get chance to taste verity and great cuisine in coming months. Stay Tune for further update.
Knowing fellow foodie friend Vishal ,Pallab and Sabyasachi Ray  was icing on the cake…It was my pleasure to meet you guys.

"29314710","Fantastic late lunch at the Oakleaf which is located inside Oakwood Residence Kapil, Financial District. If you love continental food and are always on the look out for places that serve good continental then you must check out Oakleaf, if you haven't already.
It was already 3 PM when I called them to check their timings and even though they officially stop serving their lunch menu at 3, the manager, Mr Ramesh offered to serve us anything from the full menu. We reached around 3:20 PM and were seated promptly. The place is very tastefully done and the view from the top is very nice. They also have a All-Day menu which includes sandwiches and burgers.
We started with a Ceasar Salad with chicken and bacon which was one of the best I've had in Hyderabad. The lettuce was well marinated and the chicken was grilled to perfection.
For the main course, we ordered a veg Lasagna for the missus and fish & chips for me. Again, the main course was excellent. Finally a place that gets fried fish right.
We finished with an Apple Trudel which was again out of this world. It was served warm with a dollop of vanilla ice-cream on top.
The prices are not too high and the taste and portion size makes it total VFM. The bill for 2 came to ₹1938. A Service charge was not included in the bill, so I tipped them appropriately.
Got to go back soon to try more stuff from their menu, specially the steak. They also have a lunch and dinner multi-cuisine buffet 7 days a week. It includes Indian, Chinese and Continental dishes. I didn't ask the price though.",4.5,"2016-05-29 17:54:38",19,36,4
"33539505","The food at Oakwood is good, but not the best. The ambience is neat, nothing fancy. I wouldn't recommend the breakfast buffet - the options are far too less. I personally like their Continental and Oriental cuisine more than their Indian. The veg biryani and paneer makhni were disappointing, but the pasta arabiatta and risotto were good. I did not like the mushroom cappuccino soup. Some of the desserts are really good, like the creme caramel! The staff is very polite and the service is superb! ",3.5,"2016-05-27 11:07:55",62,96,0
"1351980","Having read Sabyasachi Raychaudhuri sirji's review about this place, with mention of seafood, this place got added to my list of places to visit. Finally a friend and I reached over to this place for a lazy lunch. The entrance gives a corporate space look to it, especially with inclusion of accommodation in this building. We opted for window side table, to get more of the classy outdoor view that this place offers. 
As per the suggestions in the review and with the staff's suggestion, our menu consisted of: Pan Fried Pomfret, Norwegian Salmon Steak, Prawn Tempura, Apple Strudel and Barman specials in mocktails.
The pan fried pomfret ended up becoming the best version of pomfret, that i ever had! (i love seafood!) We also had a mocktail which was coffee based, it was one of the best mocktails I had in town. There was nothing that could actually go wrong with the food and drinks that we were served. A place worth visiting for sure, if you are looking for a place which is classy and serves some awesome seafood!

"260065","Oakwood, the world leaders in corporate housing and serviced apartments had started operations at Gachibowli, Hyderabad about six months ago. Over a short period, their longer stay options have become very popular especially with visiting professionals from abroad on a stint of a few months, and the property has been reporting extremely high occupancy. Oakleaf, their multi-cuisine restaurant serves Indian, Asian as well as continental cuisine catering not just to the in house guests but also to corporate parties and walk in diners.
The all-day restaurant is located on the third floor of Oakwood Residence Kapil, and can accommodate about seventy diners at a time with a lounge style seating. Three of us reached around lunchtime to see the lunch buffet already laid out. We did a recce of the buffet which had a nice compact menu of veg and non-veg items as well as salads and desserts. We were told that the restaurant has buffet breakfast and lunch as well as a set menu for dinner. Apart from that a-la-carte offerings are available all the time.
We had been invited to sample some of the special items from their menu, and without much delay we settled down with the Executive Chef of Oakleaf Mr. Brijesh Kumar to try out a set menu designed by him. Chef Brijesh, who has wide experience working for different restaurants all over India, informed us that Oakleaf is a true multi-cuisine place with a range of specialties from all over the world. They try to keep their preparations authentic, and as most of their in house guests are from Europe and South East Asia, there is a special thrust on oriental as well as continental cuisines.
We started our food journey with Prawn Tempura, batter fried prawns with a sweet chilli sauce. It is difficult to go wrong with this dish, but here it was excellent with a fluffy batter and the prawns cooked just right. Wok Tossed Chilli Fish, an oriental preparation was another one which made a mark, I loved the ginger and chilli based masala which was used in it. 
In the vegetarian section Paneer Tikka in a green marinade was quite moist and finger licking good. I love mushrooms and the other item from the tandoor, Bharwan Mushroom Kabab was extremely tasty, the mushrooms were stuffed with a cheese based marinade and grilled. In fact, a special mention has to be made of their tandoori section, all the items from that kitchen both in starters and main courses were simply superb.
In the soup section, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Mushroom Cappuccino, a garlic flavoured thick broth topped with cream. Insalata Caprese, tomato slices with egg shaped bocconcini cheese was a salad we tried out. The presentation and taste were both nice.
It was time to try out some continental food, and first out of the kitchen was Pan Fried Pomfret with Spicy Bacon and Shrimps. For a seafood lover like me, this was the dish of the day. The pomfret and the shrimps were grilled just the right amount and served with mashed potatoes, bacon, select veggies and white sauce. I liked that the seafood items retained their flavour. On the flip side, I would have loved a bit more bacon in it.
Next up was the tenderloin steak Fillet Mignon, served with a red wine based jus. The quality of meat was quite good and the sauce on top was nice. This is another dish to try out here. Lasagna Exotica, with layers of vegetables and cheese was very tempting. One could not help but appreciate the efforts taken in presentation of the dishes.
A couple of main courses from the orient were served after this. Char Kway Teow is a signature dish of the restaurant, a street delicacy from Malaysia prepared with flat rice noodles, prawns, eggs and vegetables. This is a meal by itself with a typical South East Asian soya chilli sauce in it. Gaeng Kiow Wan, the vegetarian Thai yellow curry went brilliantly with the steamed rice served with it. 
The trail of diverse cuisines continued with Murg Tikka Makhan Methi with naans. This was another dish worth coming back for. The chicken tikka was soft and succulent and the gravy was amazing. Alleppey Fish Curry with rice captured the flavour from Kerala. Corn Capsicum Kaju was a vegetarian’s delight.
Among the desserts I loved the Crème Caramel though my friends wanted the caramel sauce to be thicker.
I would go back to Oakleaf simply because the variety of dishes they offer. And they did well with many of the dishes. A look at the menu showed up quite a few other interesting dishes such as Prawn A La Grecque (Prawn cooked in white sauce served on a bed of rice), Bhuna Gosht (a favorite recipe of mine) and a Thai Stir Fried Prawns in Red Curry. I will try them on my next visit.

When Oakwood launched in Hyderabad near to my workplace, I was surely excited. Though I was not aware of the brand but the look at the property gave me positive vibes. After some moths of waited they launched their multi cuisine all day dining restaurant Oakleaf.
I was part of the pre-launch tasting and off course the grand launch. I must say that they have take pride In what they serve and they should. It is difficult to sustain in an area which is hogged by star hotels or price sensitive office goers.
I have been there already a couple of times and I was impressed with their executive lunch buffet spread. This particular review however is for a complimentary meal as a part of the bloggers table.
The ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful because you have a great view while you dine here. I specially love to take the seat by the window.
Since I have already tried their buffet, I opted for a-la-carte. I requested to chef to recommend us some of their signature dishes. Taking his suggestions, I ordered for a grilled salmon, mahi amritsari & veg lasagne.
The fish amritsari was punched with the right flavours but the only distractor for me was the use of Basa fish. I somehow feel this fish is ruining the industry standard somehow. There has to be an easier replacement for it. The fish itself doesn't generate any flavor. Anyways, coming back the spice level was perfectly infused to ensure it's not hot but spicy,
Next the salmon was served and I haven't had such better grilled fish in Hyderabad. It appeared that every layer of the fish was taken out and baked. The fish would melt in your mouth and accompanied by the salsa sauce gives you the right amount of tanginess. 
Though I wanted meat lasagne, I settled for the veg. I will never regret the decision. Being a pure carnivore, I could not imagine that veg. lasagne would taste this great. Each layer was packed with the cheese in such a manner that the veggies doesn't fall apart and the baked to perfection. I can go back for it again.
I tried few desserts from their buffet spread. A special mention for the creme brûlée.
I would definitely go back to try some more option of their menu.bongfooodie.com",4,"2015-12-18 08:38:07",129,2409,0

But the more fun part were the little add-on condiments to the salads provided.They had cheesy stuff, goats cheese, yogurt etcetc mixed with a variety of spices and the mixture was pure delight. And the price not too expensive I must say. Loved the hospitality and the ambience. Will definitely come back. Thank you Oakleaf! ",4,"2015-10-25 18:50:07",41,197,1

The food was good right from the starters to the desserts, though the choice was limited. I wont forget to mention the special thai green curry that I had and yes the fish dishes too. The things that I think could be improved are addition of few items more throughout the course and the highly expensive category. Overall a fine place to dine in a group.",3.5,"2015-10-22 20:42:04",137,287,1

Visited for a lunch buffet with team. It was nice experience. Food options were good, liked the service and ambiance ( it was a bright afternoon)  but some how the table is not comfortable to accommodate two people ( we four of us need to combine two such table by our self). Need improvement on hospitality and food choices for non-vegetarians.

"27150919","Our group wanted to explore a new place which had at least two or three diff types of cuisines on the menu . After seeing their menu in Zomato decided to try this place.
We reached around 8.50pm and  we were very happy with the ambience of the place, beautiful paintings , comfortable and soft seating , good layout of cutlery and crockery on  the table which sparked our expectations .
Once seated ,the attendant quickly gave us the menu . The menu looked quite elaborate and we quickly placed our order. 
I ordered Bharwan Mushroom ke Kabab , Vegetable tempura , Cottage cheese veggie burger and apple strudel. I remember looking at the time in my mobile while ordering as i was expecting a call. It was roughly 9.00 pm .
The attendant said minimum 20 minutes before the food will be served. We were fine with that. We started taking pictures of ourselves to pass time.
It was around 9.35 pm , the server came and gave us  complimentary poppadoms and we were so hungry that we quickly finished it. We all were looking at each others faces for the order to arrive. After 9.45 pm we got our first order 
Bharwan Mushroom kebab - Overall it was ok , the cheese was gooey and over flowing but i felt the mushrooms flavors could have been further enhanced. 
Vegetable Tempura -  The tempura was good but  did not have their trademark golden color on all the veggies as in not consistent . The sweet chilli dip was really good . 
The cottage cheese burger with sesame buns - I was really expecting lot of sesame on the buns but it wasnt so. The patty was cooked perfectly but not crunchy. The cottage cheese  patty was perfectly seasoned. Overall the burger was good and quite filling. Good quantity of fries but the coleslaw was not good . I was expecting the salad on the side to be good but it was not.
Apple strudel - It was pastry/pie filled with  minced apple with the flavor of cinnamon served with vanilla ice cream. It was good but wished more of apple filling in it. The ice cream was nice but i felt it for me  was not required hence i didnt eat it.
Overall the food was good but the service was very slow.They have to work on this for customers to comeback .

"1688082","We decided to visit Oakleaf for our team lunch. Oakleaf is an extention to the Oakwood Hotel which is located on the 3rd floor of the Hotel. The fact that the eatery is located right next to our office premise and has been freshly commenced, made it the ideal venue for our team luncheon.
The Restaurant has a serene ambience and depicts poise. The aura was very comforting and the diner echoed with elegance. We opted for Buffet over Ala Carte to be on the economic side.
The table was well prepared and was neat and spotless and the place overall seemed hygienic. The staff was very cordial and attentive. They were very helpful and attentive towards our needs and towards our inputs.
However, the food did not live upto the expectation set by all that ambience and hospitality.
To begin with, all of us were vegeteranian except one. The options for Veg. starters were very limited and we were not even served adequately and there were prolonged intervals between each serving.  We were then offered our choice of Pasta (Penne or Macroni) in the choice of our sauce (Red or White). The pasta seemed very delicious to eye but the there was no flavour of herbs or cheese and tasted very bland.  
We quickly moved towards main course. I started with soup. The broth of the soup was very light and extra salty, still retained essential flavour and tasted good to my taste buds only after addition of additional sauces and dressing. I liked the idea of serving four seperate kinds butter (each being seasoned by a particular herb). It tasted good when paired along the bread.
I love salads and hence I personally appreciated the exibit of multiple salad ingredients such as olives, jalapeno, pickle, cucumber, corn, beans, letuce, etc. all arranged seperately on the table to help create your own salad bowl with your choice of dressings and sauces available. I believe it was the best part of my experience with Oakleaf.
Moving on to the main course, I noticed that the menu lacked versatility and options. It appeared to me as if the buffet main course menu was not planned properly.  Rice lovers had only two options 1) Steamed garlic rice and Veg  Biryani. The biryani did not even remotely taste to its name and there was too much corn and chunky vegetable pieces.
They served Veg. Soft Noodle which tasted good to me, although a little bland to others and lacked texture. It was a little stiff and should have been steamed or boiled a little longer.  My colleagues complained about the Tandoori rotis being very rubbery. I am not sure how the non vegeteranians felt about the food as our table was dominated by vegeteranians.
Dessert was a total bust for most of us. I loved the Gulab Jamuns offered to me. They were round, soft, juicy, absolutely perfect. However, the Spanish muffins were too tough against the gum and didn't even taste fine. The Sabudana desert lacked sweetness and had a very thick consistency (more than whats required). I was a little disappointed for the fact that they did not charter any eggless dessert apart from Gulab Jamuns.
Overall, the dining experience was very average. I would suggest Oakleaf to add a few variety on their buffet sleeve and improve their Dessert. The hospitality of staff members and the ambience is the silver lining. However, a diner is only appreciated for the food it serves.  With a little attention in this area, I believe Oakleaf can become the finest in the segment they are competing with.",3,"2015-07-31 01:52:55",1,20,0
"12733501","Oakleaf is a all day restaurant which is a part of oakwood hotel, which is located in the prime location of Financial district of gachibowli, opposite to ICICI bank. I saw this place featured on zomato collections for newly opened places. and with free time in hand, i just wanted to try their lunch buffet. So landed here on the same day and had the lunch buffet. 
The ambiance is very good and simple. The furniture was very cozy and comfortable. The outside view of the corporate companies will leave spellbound and this is quite a place for the corporate lunched and team lunches, which is specifically designed for the business meetings etc. 
Coming to food, they have a simple spread which i neither huge or small, but it is well sufficient for an average consumer. The spread has varied cuisines ranging from Indian to Italian and counter parts of the oriental cuisine also. 
I started with the schezwan noodle soup, which was spicy and tangy. Being a clear soup, it was very essential for me to make up myself for a good food ahead. Then i had the starters, 3 of them 2 are veg and 1 non-veg. In the veg i had the tandoori mix veg platter and the stuffed cheese mushroom. In non veg i had the chili chicken. Among these i liked the stuffed mushroom and the chili chicken. 
The stuffed cheese mushroom is made with the cheese stuffed inside the mushroom and then sauteed in the malai sauce, which gave it a very smooth texture. Even the wrap in which the mushroom is slightly evident if you take a close look. It had an after taste which taste like the burnt cheese, which i find the similar taste in the pizza.It was served with the fried garlic yogurt which was even refreshing in taste, which was strong and tasty at the same time. I loved it. 
The chili chicken was done perfectly with the tender chicken coated with the chili flakes and then sauteed in the sauces to make it taste spicy and tangy at the same time. I liked it with the green chutney which they provided as an accompaniment. 
In the main course, the dishes are limited and i like the  way they up their menu. I ordered for a stir grilled paprika fish, from the live counter, which was perfectly done and was literally melting in my mouth. The grilled part needs some more perfection. The sauce was good. Then from the kitchen i got a complimentary dish from chef, its the tagliatelle lamb stroganoff. It was served with rosemary dressing and the cheese shavings are very impressive. The minced lamb was flavorful and the delicious flavor was escalated with the charred rosemary. I loved it. The tagliatelle was soft and was well cooked. 
Then i started my Indian main course with the murgh saagwala which was abit bland for my taste and i had it with the tandoori roti. The chicken biryani was average and the salan was not at all good. The raita is better. 
In desserts, the mango cake and peanut butter shells were amazing. The sweet shots are strong with the flavor and goes well with the cake. The service is very good and their gestures are simply awesome. Had a chat with their top chefs pradeep more and Brijesh kumar and they shared their experiences in being part of the hotel and their menu. etc. ..It was really nice meeting them over lunch and they were very simple and nice to interact with. 
On a whole with a courteous and comfortable lunch, I had a great experience and will look forward for more from this place.",4,"2015-07-14 12:44:21",114,1928,20
