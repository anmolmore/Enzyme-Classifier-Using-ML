"43854801","Yesterday we thought of having good biryani in middle of the work and we were sorting restaurants near by dlf and as we are crossing the road we found foodie cage  then we  thought of giving a try . 
First entering into the restaurant we found it was not filled  and the ambience is good and it has good theme all around 😊 and it’s one of the best ambience in this locality
We Just ordered  chicken biryani and baby corn Manchuria...chicken biryani has no aroma at all. I don’t know  either it is fresh or not and chicken pieces are too dried...we are getting dried rice in the middle of our bite of biryani..so pathetic😡 I guess biryani in train is far more better then this biryani.baby corn Manchuria  is so wet and not properly cooked.Both  were not up to the mark. Waste of money and time.
Foodie cage management should look into this to improve there services in this competitive locality.",1,"2018-01-07 15:09:20",52,123,5
