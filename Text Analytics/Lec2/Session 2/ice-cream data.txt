cookie dough, fruit flavors

every flavor you make. I look at all the good flavors offered in regular and then I look at the meager offerings in light/low fat.  I'm an ice crean freak, I want my ice cream, so I end up buying what I know I shouldn't have bcse I want that flavor.  I may have to stop eating it all together bcse of the fat/calorie content. Don't go to light, please stick to low fat, my hips are begging.
