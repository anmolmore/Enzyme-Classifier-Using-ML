"464690","Ordered a chicken kathi roll for a quick bite late at night. On my first visit to Hyderabad, I must say I had quite a shock to my system. It was SO SO spicy!
Probably typical of this region, but it was an intense experience for me. I was left wondering if this is what food from hell looks like- the ones they show in advertisements with fire all around.
Apart from this, the quickest food delivery I've ever had. The roll kind of fell apart after opening and should be done better.
Otherwise the food tasted alright. Go for this if you have that chilli appetite.",2,"2018-10-01 14:54:34",35,179,0
