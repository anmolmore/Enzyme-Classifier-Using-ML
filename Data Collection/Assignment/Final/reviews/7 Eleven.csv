Horrible food. The kadai paneer was WAY too oily. Butter naan was more like butter rubber mat. Romali roti was ok. 100 rupee service charge id your order is less than 500 is a big time rip off. Definite no no.",1,"2013-12-26 00:09:20",2,1,0

When I parked my bike in the basement , I did not expect many in the restaurant. It turned out to be below par as the restaurant was totally empty. There is nothing special about the ambiance in the 40 seater restaurant. The usual tables and chairs with ordinary hanging lights, a small LCD and some pictures of Hyderabad landscape. 
Food :
The two attenders were excited about the visitors in the restaurant. The restaurant serves basic Indian and Chinese cuisine. The soups in the menu were quite inexpensive with veg @59 and its non veg @69. We were not ready for a 'try out' at this place , so ordered cream of mushroom as a safe bet. The quantity of the soup was good , but I think they had compromised on the thickness to maintain the same. As my friend wanted to have fish , we ordered Fish Tikka as recommended by the attender. They served 8 pieces and it was good enough for a starter. Chicken soft noodles for Main course did not excite us much and we parceled the same for consumption at a later point in time. 
Bill payment was a also a headache as the amount was debited from the bank although the machine did not print the receipt. 7 eleven has to improve up on almost all areas of customer service to raise a competitive siren to its counterparts in Gachibowli. Else, its on the path of 9/11.",2.5,"2013-07-24 14:40:49",97,1342,0
