"31906531","Phulkas were good.
We ordered
Dal Tadka : Very hot, nicely made, it had too much garlic though.
Aloo gobhi sabzi: Also very hot, as a North Indian I am used to eat dry aloo gobhi sabzi, and it was with gravy. But it was good.
For price its a good deal, if you want to have home type food, as the food was not oily. ",4,"2018-04-04 13:16:39",175,571,1

"34892260","Sometimes we get the best food at the small restaurants. I was walking with my friends on the streets of Gachibowli where I spotted this new outlet. I decided to try this place and indeed it was a very good decision.
I took parcel of Chicken 65 and Chicken Chilly and both were priced at 120RS. I would say it was a steal deal.
â€¢ Chicken 65 - It was one of the best chicken 65 I ever had till date. Quantity was too good. Taste was heavenly. It was finished in less than 2 minutes.
â€¢ Chicken Chilly - Chicken Chilly is the famous chinese dish which i prefer almost every time I order food. The Boneless chicken pieces tossed in chilly,soya sauce and some capsicum at the top was excellent in taste.
The place has general ambience and I would prefer taking parcel or order for home delivery and enjoy these food with dear ones at home. I highly recommend this place.ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ",4,"2018-04-01 14:46:00",306,2005,3

"51359470","Curry was good and spicy but naan was not worthy as you are paying rs 20 per naan. May be because the naans were tawa naan, not tandoori naans.",4,"2018-03-02 16:57:00",6,0,0
