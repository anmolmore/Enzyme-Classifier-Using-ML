"43940631","Definitely yummy tasting and unique stuff.
But one thing I really want the owners to look into is hygiene. I loved to order from here but once had been to the place physically and witnessed the store in the middle of their own garbage, I can't bring myself to get that picture out of my head.
A humble suggestion, you are doing great with the idea and flavours, why not do it right by also caring about the hygiene. It's a responsibility that comes with food. You can do wonders.
Their menu deserves 5*, but rating them as a business.",3,"2019-05-18 00:15:19",4,3,0

It is tender coconut water blended with fresh coconut Malai and for all those coconut lovers out there, here's what you are looking for !!!

"51385400","Coco banana was good. The taste of banana was subtle. The taste was well kept to balance both coconut water and banana. As the fruit is ice blended you can see the icy formation on top.

"32732516","The dry summers of Hyderabad demands hydration. I ordered coconut milk shake 500 ml and watermelon with coconut milk and pomegranate with coconut milk.
I loved all the three juices.
Too refreshing.
But it would be really great if they can writr over the content.
As it is ample sweet. I was in doubt if they have added sugar or if the coconut itself is this sweet.
Over all great experience.
Would order again. ",4,"2019-03-30 14:49:27",135,419,0

Coco Mint is just a perfect soothing one with right blend of coconut water n mint while Coco Orange tasted more like mix fruit juice.

But didn't know that the blend of tender coconut water and the copra(malai) can be this amazing! This drink is very tasty, refreshing and energizing.

I love drinking coconut juice and when ever I see Coconut Juice on a menu there is a twinkle in my eyes.

üçπFresh coconut water blended with tender coconut malai makes it a healthy and tasty refreshment to have. The white texture of this resembles Toddy. Delivered quantity (500ml) was a lot for a person and there was no size customisation.
