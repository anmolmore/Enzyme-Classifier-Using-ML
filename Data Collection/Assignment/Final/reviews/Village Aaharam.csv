"37924927","VA in short is a wonderful food place to be at. When the food is good , we forget the ambience and that is what happens here. During my earlier visits I observed some very good & nice staff which was little missing during the latest visit BUT the TASTE will make us overlook this factor.
We happened to Order (Between 2 visits ha)¬† North Indian Thali, South Indian Thali, Chicken Fry, Chicken Curry, Egg Biryani, Prawns fry and Pulihora too. It is observed that VA uses HAND POUND rice and you will not find the white polished rice in any rice item that you order and in thali's they serve MULTI GRAIN Rotis which are very nice.¬† Any chicken item will be country bird and you DO NOT get Broiler chicken which is an other good thing. I also assume that the eggs they use are from ""Happy Chicken"" farms .
In Thalis, they serve Dal, a wet curry, a good fry and a coarse grounded Chutney which i think has an amazing taste and a must try. Dal and what ever curry he serves in thalis are lip smacking .
For Breakfast, it is again all about health and taste. If you order Dosa , do not expect that to be white in color but tasty. Pesarattu is simply amazing , Vada or garelu as they call it are a must try and the sambhar they offer in Breakfast is palatable.
I suggest you visit this place for Breakfast and then if its for Lunch, you should try their Thali along with a nice side dish of your choice.¬†
Kudos to Village Aaharam for their intriguing Menu and quality . I personally advice the staff to carry a little smile on their face and I tell you, IT WILL HAVE ITS POSITIVE EFFECT.",5,"2019-04-24 17:09:55",23,18,4

"39289095","Pathetic service ! After waiting ten minutes this morning for someone to come up
and take my order , I was rudely informed by the counter billing guy to either wait for a guy or I can choose to leave . I left the place recalling my earlier bitter experience with a waiter who just was
Tossing plates and water bottle on the table . I am never gonna go back to this place and won‚Äôt recommend anyone to go unless they wanna lose their self respect and wait for long time to get their food ordered ! ",1,"2019-04-04 12:29:01",3,13,0

"1098421","Amazing food, did hear about it before but couldn't make. I had a late lunch so there werent too many people.  Spacious and neat space...though i had brown rice for the 1st time it tasted so good with curries. the best dal, samabar and curries i had, natu kodi fry was bit hard...like the curd. overall i had a sumptuous lunch..,simple and tasty. Highly recommended.",4,"2018-11-01 19:19:57",2,0,0
"1202564","Amazing place. Ambience is just ok. But the food is really good. They say it's all organic, hope it's all true but the taste is... Ahhh! Must go, must try. They also have an organic store just near the entrance. Pretty pocket friendly, not like the other guys who bomb your pocket. :)",5,"2018-10-23 20:13:54",54,68,0
"45433494","I have visited this place to have a dinner. natukodi biriyani was cost of 300 but it will be enough to only 1 person. They hav use the normal rice not the basmati.. Rice quality was nice and organic..prices are high but food quantity is less. I could suggest go for Thalli's then any other items",2,"2018-10-07 12:34:36",5,4,0
"854088","Loved the food...thalis are served with brown rice which is great quality. Multi grain dosa and curries which come in thali deliver authentic Andhra taste. Breakfast is spectacular. Multi grain dosa and pongal and definitely among the best in gachibowli",4,"2018-10-07 09:54:54",18,179,0
"30287394","This place claims they are organic restaurant, but they are serving non veg dishes. So, I don‚Äôt know authenticity of organic. We have visited this place week back, Non veg is very expensive for the portions they serve. There serving portions are small. Overall food taste is ok ok. Items like jeera rice was little oily, curd rice would have been better. Chutneys are good. Dosas, idly are good. Salt portions are little inconsistent.",3,"2018-10-05 19:41:59",6,4,2
"31834517","Went when hunger was at its maximum. Was not disappointed. We were five, so we tried all kinds of rice there is. Tomato rice, sambhar rice, curd rice, jeera rice. I liked sambhar rice, but my friends liked jeera rice with dal and tomato rice also. Ghee idly was also very nice. My friends were a little unhappy with ambience so to speak and the portions served, but I went back with a full stomach and a big smile. So 5 stars.",5,"2018-09-29 16:52:10",1,36,1
"34081283","It appears they put lot of baking soda. After eating small amount we were feeling full. Even after 7 hours the stomach is full. I will never go there again, nor will i recommend to anyone. Dont give unlimited food with baking soda in it to make us feel full, give limited food with good quality.",2,"2018-09-28 21:07:28",3,1,0
"7238481","One of my favourite places. Have been trying this restaurant from last 4+ months and did not get disappointed even once. 
Food is organic and tasty. I really liked their preparations that are moderate spicy. It‚Äôs a good food and no bull, type of place. ",5,"2018-09-12 16:34:12",6,2,0
"27278290","Authentic food , heavy crowd in lunch time , breakfast also good , if you really like homely prepared village kind of food , you can get such food here , millets we're good in taste , sambar , chutney also authentic in taste , dosa not impressed as we had it in parcel , will try meals for the next time ",5,"2018-09-01 12:09:14",106,758,0
"373863","Been there with family and ordered Mutligrain dosa, ghee karampodi idly, Natukodi fried peice biryani and egg biryani. All the tasted items are amazing with their taste and single polished rice under biryani also added the health consciousness element to its height. Really recommendable place for healthy geeks. Also, have a stall adjacent to this place selling all the millets and other healthy stuff and natural ripen fruits.",4,"2018-08-13 15:05:04",26,4,0
"2221236","They more than just justify the Andhra Cuisine. Had their South Indian Thali. Food was awesome and filling. Every item was well prepared. I personally don't like Tomato Chutney, but their Tomato Chutney was quite good.
Definitely worth trying. Cheers üçª ",4,"2018-08-04 17:40:46",35,24,0
"1398737","This is a great place to catch a full and hearty Indian meal. I especially like them for their lunch spread. The breakfast options are very limited but the veg thali is unmatched in taste and simplicity. A must try place.",5,"2018-07-17 17:30:41",6,20,0
"93057","Pathetic service ! 
I‚Äôve ordered for a dosa and waited for more than half an hour, in the end the service guy comes up asking me if need some water and dosa is still not prepared. Thats really bad. I was pissed and got up to leave the place and no body even cared to ask me or stop me. 
Yeah they don‚Äôt serve sambar as well. 
Also not many options for vegetarians, So vegetarians should choose other restaurants around. 
I recommend not to visit this place.",1,"2018-07-14 11:44:11",73,411,0
"1553550","Village Aaharam as the name translates to village food is one of the few places that are known to serve simple soul food that satiates you to the core.
Located on the road that runs towards financial district from Raidugam is quite easy to locate.
This place is known to use all organic ingredients to prepare the dishes and the rice served herer is unpolished brown rice.
I wanted to try their non veg thali looking at other tables however I was informed that the Thali would take time and I have ordered for a portion of jeera rice and mutton curry.
The jeera rice came loaded with cashew and had a good amount of jeera and the mutton curry was delicious and had succulent mutton pieces cooked to perfection with a not so spicy gravy.
The quantity on offer is just about sufficient for one person while the costs are on the higher side.
Hope more such restaurants come up with an option. Of eating organic food just the way our counterparts from villages do.",4,"2018-06-18 15:16:15",179,1593,4
"31808905","This is my second visit and I am highly disappointed this time. Food was full of salt and quality of food is below standard. One of the curry was smelling like a chemical!
I really doubt the organic claims! Food was served cold as it was after 3 pm! I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1,"2018-06-03 21:46:23",1,1,0
"10386041","Their food is authentic and flavorful- loved it. Especially awesome are their Idli dishes, Vada and Pongal. Service is a little slow and availability of dishes varies throughout the day. However the reason I‚Äôll be returning to eat here is the taste!",4,"2018-05-06 15:40:03",7,4,0
"32229628","As the name, this place serves organic food straight from the farm. They offer pot glasses for drinking water. We got ours home. The food is less spicy, also the quantity is less, any dish serves exactly not more than two. They also have a shop to sell grandmas snacks. Do visit this place if you prefer organic food.",4,"2018-05-05 09:15:08",9,50,0
"43573341","A place located in Khajaguda road, next to DPS school. They have ample of parking space so there won't be any difficulty to park your vehicle.
Very spacious place which connecting to ""dhaba"" somehow where you can expect complete south Indian food and water in clay pot.
We have order veg thali, which carries one chapati, small portion of lemon rice, chutney along with sambar and rasam. Nothing was hot , if they would serve hot then taste will be better.And yes, at the end they served sweet and curd which was simply yummmmy!  
Also, they need to improve the quality of rice served and items are very limited.
Food - 3/5
Service-4/5
Price - bit high",3,"2018-05-03 01:55:14",71,2078,0
"1853730","'The' place , for someone who loves authentic, traditional Indian food. Been here for lunch and opted for veg thali. Every single dish was delicious and you just can't stop eating though you feel full üòÅ
All the vegetables are straight from the farm and the rice served is also semi pounded. Dal, sambar, cabbage poriyal, drumstick curry, alu fry, rasam, semiya payasam were all delicious and not to forget the curd...it's really fresh and sweet.
Ambience is simple like a dhabha which you really shouldn't be bothered off, coz u get great and healthy food for what you pay! ",5,"2018-04-13 21:23:26",61,261,0
"2648830","Went to have lunch at Village Aaharam which is situated on Khajaguda road towards Nanakram Guda. They are serving South Indian food. We ordered for Veg Thali and it was served with One Chapati, table spoons of lemon rice, chutney, papad and sweet. After finishing that they served us with rice, tomato Dal, brinjal sabji, tomato curry and chutney along with Curd, Sambhar and rasam. The food is ok could have been better if the curries would have been served hot. The curries and the Chapati was cold.
Service on the other hand is superb. The cost is on a higher side but ok as they claim to be serving organic food.
Star attraction of the day was the Curd which was just awesome.
All in all a grt place for south indian stuff.. ",3,"2018-03-21 15:09:39",72,1064,4
"36956799","Great place to enjoy some organic food. I went for lunch and opted for veg thali and found it good üòã
Food - food was tasty and we can feel that the food is organic. The bhindi masala üòç was the best that I've ever had in Hyderabad. Too good. And their curd too was yummyüòçüòç. The servings are not limited. You can take multiple servings of any item.
Price - ‚Çπ155 for veg thali. I think the price is justified, afterall they are giving organic food and also the servings are not limited.
Ambience - I Hindi I'll call the restaurant as ""aao Khao aur jao"". In short it's not a place to sit and enjoy. You sit eat and leave. Because it's just like a dhaba , not a proper restaurant.
Overall good experience üòâüòäakhilrohal.blogspot.com",4,"2018-03-06 02:19:04",57,481,4

"6624401","Was reminded of my summer vacations at grandma's village. 
Curries made from vegetables fresh, natural and indigenous along side wholesome hand-pounded rice. 
The paneer gravy reminded me of village egg curry (there was no paneer back then in Andhra villages). And yes sweet and nourishing curd/yogurt of yore for the finale.¬†¬†
The cooking itself is not very accomplished but an inviting place nevertheless.",4,"2018-01-08 10:51:27",52,93,0
"31314215","If you are into organic food this is the place. They serve water in clay pots, everything sold here is organic. Only drawback was that they sell mutton only on some days and they serve brown rice for Biryani which was a turn off. Overall a healthy experience.",3.5,"2018-01-04 13:14:17",89,1657,5
"3158048","Went for lunch and opted for veg thali. One of the best thali available in the town. That too organic home style.
Positives:
- home style, organic and looking at the food feels healthy.
- no masala or oily items involved 
- everything tastes awesome 
- different options from the routine stuff
Negatives:

"15732510","Was in my bucket list so long, finally am here for breakfast with two of my friends. It's located on Nanakramguda road, nearby Outer Ring Road 1st exit. It's a single big room with around 10-15 tables. Feels like home made food. Water and tea are served in earthen matka, feels so different. 
Coming to food, had Breakfast Combo which had Two Idlis, One Multigrain Wada, Pongal, Millet Upma, Multigrain Dosa, Raagi Jaava and three chutneys plus sambhar. Everything tastes very good. Had separate Multigrain Wada (One plate- 5 pieces), Minapattu. Minapattu is a normal dosa and is overpriced. Overall a healthy appetite and tasty food. 
My suggestion is to have breakfast combo, so you can taste all the varieties. Singles seems costly.",4,"2017-08-05 12:07:54",189,1486,6

"30260723","Delicious yet healthy food. We had the the tiffin combo they offered. It had dosa, vada, idly, pongal and upma. The upma is made if millets yet it tasted much better than the regular upma. The dosa and vada are multi-grain, dosa was tasty because of the onion and the ginger they add, it was not crispy as one would expect a dosa to be but a multi-grain can not be crispy. The pongal was tasty, idly was soft and vada although was very small it tasted really good. This was served with ginger chutney, palli chutney and another onion,tamato,garlic based chutney with sambar. I liked all the chutneys too. Sambar was little sweet.",4.5,"2017-07-10 14:07:29",15,33,0
"33093114","A healthy way to start your day is to have breakfast here.

"41497640","Went all the way from Banjara Hills to this restaurant, but was disappointed that they couldn't convince me to try their House specials. I was suggested to try their veg thali.

"33593508","When we heard that Village Aharam opened their branch in the city, we were more than excited to try it. The ambience is simple and gives you an impression of mess. They serve complete organic food and this is the USP of this place. We ordered for Veg Thali, Prawns Thali, Chicken Thali and Fish fry. The Non-veg Thalis are just a extra non-veg curry along with the Veg Thali. The Prices were very decent and worth the price.The offerings are simple and the food feels so homely.The water is served in pot glasses and one could carry these glasses home!The rice they serve is unpounded rice and one would crave for more and more of it. The fryums were crunchy and delicious. The sweet is one aspect that all of us did not like. The Thali came with pulihora rice, Roti, Drumstick curry, Dosakaya pickle,fryums, Dal, Pappu chaaru,Sambhaar, Rasam and curd. Everything tasted homely! The curd is must try as they store it in Pot vessels. The Fish fry, Prawn curry were amazing. Chicken curry disappointed me a bit though.Overall a satisfying place to visit for homely, healthy and thali food lovers!",4.5,"2017-06-19 17:04:27",164,900,7
