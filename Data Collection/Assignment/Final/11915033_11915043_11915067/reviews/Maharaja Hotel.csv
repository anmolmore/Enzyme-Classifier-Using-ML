"39164636","I placed order for the starter chilli chicken after midnight. Usually for sides. The quantity was good however the pieces were bit hard. Taste is ok type. And one more thing they cook the food as per our customization (we preferred without curry leaves), and voila!
Not bad, had good experience with the food. 👍",4,"2019-03-13 01:56:12",39,77,3
