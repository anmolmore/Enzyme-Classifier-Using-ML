"1021254","Kebab pavilion was ok. The options are less and the taste was missing. Tables are very close to each other and it seems to be very crowded. Food could have been more tastier. ",3,"2019-03-23 01:25:08",3,2,0
"60610495","Amazing food and service. The appetizers were lovely, However they could work on the main course dishes. Beautiful ambience. I had Zomato gold but that atmosphere made me forget about everything and didn't use it. Must visit.",5,"2019-01-24 10:27:37",6,4,0
"46355289","I was gone over there with my frnd the kebabs are very tasty especially the prawn kebab I was seating in the lawn enjoying the Gaza’ls but lots of mosquitoes was there in the evening apart from that it was very good",5,"2018-09-03 04:04:50",6,5,0
"975655","We had gone there for a Office dinner and were accommodated in the lawn with a big screen to watch the match and enjoy the food
Ambiance: Great ambiance as the place is outdoor and you can enjoy the match with a group of friends and family while gorging into the food. the only challenge is mosquitoes :) something does not change be it a 1* or 5* hotel - great place to be never the less Rating 4/5
Food: good spread they have a chat and live counter and good spread of dishes for the buffet. Some of the names did not not match up with the dish for example they had the Lal Mas which did not actually taste like the original version however was tasty. Someone has said - whats in a name.
being a sea food lover the fish was something to die for. very suttle and soft
Overall a great spread. Coming t dessert it had the usual spread although did not have much but whatever I tasted was good be it the mousse, Phirni, Chocolate cake etc. Something new was the mirchi ka halwa, hmm not the sweet version but was spicy but worth trying. They also had the shawarma counter which was a good accompaniment. When I spoke to my colleagues who had Veg they said they would rate the food at 3/5 so overall I will give it a 3.5/5
Service: Not to the class i would have expected from Ella group. but not bad nevertheless. Rating 3/5",3,"2018-06-09 08:28:57",24,22,1
"47770117","Worst experience of my lifetime. I booked 6 seats for this hotel 4 days back before visiting through dineout paid booking and when we went at the location there was some marriage going on there. Management didn't helped in any ways. Don't ever visit this place. They don't deserve 1.0 also.",1,"2018-02-25 14:01:46",8,101,0
"37032775","Not sure why its rated so low. I stayed in ellaa for business trip for 14 days and the chef at kebab Pavilion was impressiing me daily with his skills. A must try is *pathar ka gosht* , *bbq chicken* , *fish bbq* , kashmiri kulcha.
I liked the evening ambience of garden dining. Over all value for money.",4,"2018-01-05 02:48:14",22,25,0
"604629","This place has gone to dogs! 
I visited this place after 4 years, the food quality, taste and service, every thing has gone for a toss. 
I requested the waiter to call the chef to check if they can do a dish I used to have earlier, the guy seemed reluctant to call the chef first, it took some real convincing to get the chef. 
The chef came and immediately agreed to do the dish but it was nowhere close to what i was looking for, they actually gave the standard panner tikka with few chunks of pineapple, re heated it and served me as Tandoori chat. Sigh! 
BTW, the menu shown in Zomato is an old one, the dishes and the prices have both changed. ",1,"2018-01-03 23:17:11",1,78,0

Ambience 4/5
Service. 4/5
It was an office party and they couldn't have find better place than ella. It has great Ambience and wonderful hospitality.
The food was delicious except the chicken biryani and vegetable soop which was totalled. Rest all the dishes were worth trying. ",4,"2017-09-17 08:06:15",82,447,0

"30802490","The kebabs are good. The place is open so it gives a good environment to drink and have their kebabs. The unlimited food and drinks offer is worth trying. But the cons here is that food becomes cold very fast in open and their service takes a long time to replace it. Overall this place can certainly be tried once with unlimited food and drinks offer. One heads up , they provide 4 snacks only apart from unlimited drinks in the offer. That is the offer I took . If they have any other or changed it , I might not be knowing abt that.",3.5,"2016-07-27 00:02:24",39,51,0
"307459","average food taste. extremely slow on service. it took 20 minutes to get water for them, in Hyd summer, you keep on asking for the stuff they will take own sweet time. 
They used to be good, however somethings have changed in last few months. ",2.5,"2016-04-20 10:01:49",86,700,0
"15542175","I never thought I'd give such a low rating for any restaurant and neither had I anticipated on giving a long rambling review. But here you go: The service was abominable. Even though the food was great and prices were okay, just because of the service I have to give them a rating of 1.5. Buffet food cannot be eaten outside, hard drinks can be taken only till 10.30 and so on. It was already a bad start to hear all these restrictions but even after we ordered everything, they took a lot of time to serve it. They didn't serve it to our table, they didn't provide glasses for hard drinks and it took them 15mins just to provide ice. It took them even longer to bring out the starters and main course. They should definitely work on their service. Until they do so, I don't think I'll visit them again.",1.5,"2016-02-08 22:16:03",5,6,0
"3174668","my second visit to this restaurant. .n i must say dat the quality of food has improved a lot though few items in d buffet were not that great and there is definately scope for improvement.  .the starters paneer tikka,crispy corn,onion rings and chicken tikka were very good. .njoyed d papri chat as well.  they have a huge buffet spread but since my tummy was already full i only had d noodles n few veggies. .in desserts i liked kala jamun,kalakand n mango cake. .they need to improve the quality of desserts.

"607723","I did my baby's first birthday here recently. The staff was very cooperative. Hosted dinner and cocktails for almost 70 people. The food was really good and their buffet has this huge and amazing spread of veg & non-veg dishes, South Indian traditional dishes and a lavish spread of desserts. Would have preferred the food to have been a little more spicy, but then again, that's me! Special appreciation to Mr. Khoteish, the restaurant manager for his assistance during the birthday bash.

"142203","Not recommended. Even if you have no other place to go near financial district gachibowli, pls don't go here. 
We went for lunch buffet. Buffet is loaded with varieties. But the food is either worse, bland or vaguely edible. Service was decent. But half the tables we booked for team lunch were out in the hot Hyderabad sun!! Most of the folks just stood n ate. 
Three items out of around 20 were actually tasty - the gulab jamun, dosa(chutney was vomit material though) and plain water. Everything else right from soup till other desserts were not worth even trying out.",1.5,"2015-03-19 23:52:36",51,194,0

"3044744","Good Kebabs... Nice place to enjoy a calm and quite dinner. 
The fish kebabs are just too good... the chicken and veg kebabs are good too... especially it is good to see them being made right in front of you... the tandoor is outside in the lawn area and the kebabs are grilled there...
We have been with friends family... it has been really nice.
Just be careful with the mosquitoes... else everything is good at this place.
This place is awesome if you want to enjoy a match IPL, world cup or any big event ... they have fairly large screen but the sound system may not be the best also they cannot raise the volume as it is between a residential colony.",3.5,"2014-07-04 14:18:24",87,206,0
"519681","I had a torrid time coming to this place for 3-4 times with my colleagues. Once again, I decided to spin my money in a bargain of proximity. Surprisingly, they improved the evening buffet by miles. Moreover, the ambiance at Ellaa is damn good this time .A gentle breeze, gazelles being played in the background with a big open air live cricket screening in the front sums up the ambiance.
'Ghar Ka Khana' counter is damn good and desserts are good as well this time. Next time, I can suggest this to my friends for sure.",3.5,"2014-03-30 13:16:05",20,40,0
"64959","Good that the year 2013 has gone, the bad has gone because I visited this so called 5 star hotel in 2013. I visited this place on 31st Dec night and had a horrendous experience.
Well the definition of taste / beauty / experience varies from person to person. My experience was worst, just worst !! Let’s see how?
The Ellaa hotel has few restaurants to choose from, we choose to be in Kebab Pavilion. The NYE party passes were booked in advance and been collected. I have traveled close to 15 km to reach this place. One of my colleague told me about this place and that’s why chosen this place for celebrating NY night (after checking the website). Well the hotel is quite big and the vicinity is even bigger. There is a separate parking place, from where we had a dropping facility to our respective event place.
I have always believed that great product / food / cuisine and great service should co-exist and symbiotically feed on each other. Sometimes these may appear to counter-act (like the brake and accelerator in a car) – but eventually the existence of one strengthens the other.  Any good place if over packed  will loose its essence and look, just imagine a BMW 7 series is filled with 25 members (and you are one of them). I just don’t believe (rather don’t want to believe), how can the hotel management just for the sake of filling their pockets makes a place jam-packed??? When you have decided to allow a certain number of guests, let’s stick to it. You call yourselves a 5 star, where are the stars dear. It’s worth to make happy 200 guests instead of making 1000 unhappy guests.
Let’s face it:
As we entered the hotel, we were guided to the respective place. Can see that the place is already over packed by 9:15 pm. Not a single place to sit and around 200+ guests are already standing. Have searched everywhere for a place & could not find a single one.
Service – Horrendous – We were standing for 3 hours (for the whole event), no place to sit. No one to ask for, no one to help and more importantly no extra chairs to sit also.
Not exactly the teams fault, How can 20 people manage 1000+ people??? I am complaining about the management. The place is too packed and its difficult to even walk without hitting someone.
Starters – Very good (1 rating was just for this). Without wasting much time, have started with starters, chicken tikka, Achari murgh, Chicken shami kebab, meat balls, fish fry, Amritsari fish tikka, hara bhara kebab, corn kebab, samosa, vegetable tikka. All of them tasting good but they were not hot. Any dish or any item will not touch your hearts if you are not sitting comfortably and having it. Ours was the same condition. Need not to say the Achari murgh was very good & the meat balls too.
After having some snacks we thought let us overlook everything and thought of hitting the dance floor.
Music / DJ / Dance floor – Horrendous again -  dance floor, where is it ??? A small place which can accommodate 50 guests max, is already filled with 200+ guests. No place to put your feet, even you put, you cannot hear the music properly. The sound boxes are not effective at all. Somehow manage to adjust there for 20 minutes & could not go longer. The music numbers were bad. He didn’t had a list to play. Could not connect one song from the other. He was just playing songs like we do with our phones / systems. Thought of seeing the DJ. Seen and could easily guess that he is not a DJ at all. Some local guy they have arranged just to play the music that’s it. This 5 star hotel might have paid a very very very hefty amount of Rs. 10,000/- for this world class DJ. 
Have thought of spending some time in the outside area (open air / live band). Thou the singer was singing but there were hardly any listeners. Could not connect & was in a mood to finish and go out. Thought of having dinner right away. Its 10:30 pm.
Food (Main course) – Horrendous again and again. Was that a main course? Cold nans, cold mutton biriyani (w/o mutton pieces), watery veg Manchuria, cold fried rice & noodles. Kali daal horrible. Veg curry (don’t remember the name) was good & the mutton curry was good (which was watery too). That’s it, nothing more to choose from. Sambar / rice / etc..
Can’t imagine, this is what a 5 star hotel serves? I was thinking why I came here.
Desserts – Two cakes – very simple & very bad, just like a low class bakery. Burned & dry pudding. Halwa was good & the gulab jamun. Plum cake was ok.
Salads plates were empty most of the time.
I was really cursing myself for choosing this hotel.
Thought of again overlooking it & let’s finish the year with fun & happiness, went again to hit the dance floor. Could not spent more than 10 minutes & came out thinking of calling it a day. I left the Hotel before 12:00 pm.
VFM – Rs. 3500 for this crap. I wish I might have donated this amount to an orphanage or an old age home instead of wasting here.
My Suggestion to the management:
-          I & many guests would not have bothered to pay even 7-8 k, but we expect a basic service like a sitting place (at least for ladies).
-          Make 200 guests happy instead of making 1000 unhappy.
-          Money is not everything. Good service, good presentation & good word of mouth are more worthy.
-          No difference b/w you and a small stand alone pub.
-          What we cannot capture in numbers is the quality and good wishes from guests and the spirit and enthusiasm that might have gone into it.
-          Give good food or good service. Either one is compulsory. In absence of both you are a just a Thelawala / Bandiwala.
I am not going again, nor will suggest anyone & nor even think of passing by this road. Just avoid.",1,"2014-01-03 22:44:20",104,974,0
"41428","Another money spinner, the Ella is a strict no-no for anyone who knows his food. The number of dishes that were tasty meandered somewhere between -5 and 0. That is to say, absolutely nothing was good on the buffet spread. It was shocking to find that 'Lasooni Chicken Tikka' was the lone Non-veg starter; but what stung more was its taste. The entire staff of Ella was aware of the con they were pulling off, and continued to be non chalant throughout the proceedings. People whimpered in disdain, a few spoke out, but the Ella guys were thorough professionals at handling all the ridicule and rage. They are masters at the art of silence, and kept mum when asked about the pathetic taste and quality of food. Not even the lovers of plain rice could find solace. Ella is probably a restaurant meant for the people who live around the housing complex, and it can afford to keep breathing, only by duping these people who want to walk up to their food.",1,"2012-04-04 20:07:15",150,676,0
