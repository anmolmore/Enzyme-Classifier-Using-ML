"1635511","Ordered Boneless Pachimirchi Kodi Vepudu yesterday. Quantity was really good. First time I have ordered from this place. Chicken pieces were nice and boneless. It was SPICY as hell but the taste was just amazing. I had to order ice-cream later to soothe my tongue. But was totally worth it.",4,"2019-05-15 10:55:32",86,646,0
"31548349","Everything was disappointing. Ordered a starter "" Karam kodi vepudu - boneless"". It was nothing but Chicken 65. Not even like close to Chicken 65. It was exactly Chicken 65. We asked for a replacement and said to bring something which doesn't have any coating and which tastes like a telugu dish. We left the choice to them. They got back saying they can give in bone, not boneless, if we need without coating. We said OK and we got kothimira kodi vepudu, which tasted like a regular chicken fry. Speciality of this dish was it was oven heated. The chef didn't even know how to heat it properly using an oven. It was over heat. with disappointment, we moved on to main course. The Chicken dum biryani was again Oven heated. Same was with the prawns pulav. The prawn pieces were hard and the rice in both chicken and prawn biryani was not soft enough. A very disappointing experience and a never suggested place.",2,"2019-05-11 23:06:28",4,57,0
"33278799","I really liked the ambience of the place at first. The place looks lively. They attract a lot of crowd as well. But I have to say that I am really disappointed with the quality of service they provide. I went on a Friday afternoon and place was buzzing. But we had to wait for our food for more than 40 mins. We tried telling the staffs the order is getting delayed but still they didn't respond. That's really bad from such a restaurant. I don't think I will visit this place again.",2,"2019-03-08 15:45:51",1,98,0
"16588162","We had miryala kodi charu for soup and it was sooooo good (5/5) and then We wanted to order palnadu kodi pulav but they suggested us dum biryani saying that their’s is tastier,famous and spl from other places... so we went ahead with their suggestion... but we didn’t find it that great .. it was okay but nothing very spl nor tastier as they claimed ..! So i ended up regretting abt having dum instead of pulav..! 
Yeah i forgot the only spl item they served with biryani is gongura (which u normally find in andhra restaurants) the quantity is great and no.of pieces are more as compared to other places ! I am giving 3/5 to dum biryani cuz i expected real spicy and tasty biryani from what they said but what we actually got was just okayish 
Most of the zomato reviews complained about their service but i think they had overcome that prob cuz service is quite fast now... servers are polite too !!! ",3,"2019-02-22 18:27:48",22,10,0

"9167691","I visted this place yesterday with our team.
Recommended place for its tasty food and ambience.
We touch based almost all of their special items and had a good experience.
Ask for bahubali chicken and fry piece biryani to satisy your taste buds.
Planning to come again with my family...",5,"2018-11-03 18:09:26",4,2,0
"31379622","This place is a perfect place to visit if you want the worst service ever. We visited on a Friday afternoon heat with a hope to eat authentic Andhra food when we came across Zomato recommendation of Kakatiya in Gachibowli. The place was packed and we ordered non veg thali. Food was average but the service was of the worst quality. We got our food in like 30 mins for an order as basic as thali. When we wanted to repeat the food in our thali since it was unlimited, it took another 20 mins and by then we gave up hope. Please do not go to this place. They have very less staff and they are the ones who are simply not bothered and arrogant at the same time. ",1,"2018-11-02 22:59:56",51,2438,0

"52137770","Ordered pachimirchi kodi vepudu and chicken ghee roast in starters was awsome. Chicken fry piece biryani was tooo good. Ulavacharu chicken biryani must try. MLA biryani was made with omlette wrapped with combination of chicken and mutton.",5,"2018-10-21 14:30:03",1,2,0
"11169881","Had visited this place yesterday for lunch thinking of eating South Indian thali, but they said on Saturday and Sunday they don't serve thali, so had to order from their ala carte menu, tried kotimira paneer, gongura Kura with butter naan and gutti vankaya pulav , all these items tasted super good , ambience is also nice, the management can work on their service and reception when the customer enters looking out for menu and some drinking water which was a tad slow, but overall it's a good place to be and the food served was value for money.",4,"2018-10-21 12:16:00",15,29,0

"904443","The Food tasted very good(when hot) and the Ambience is decent. But service is painstakingly slow. 10-15 minutes for waiters to clean the table (previous people's dishes). another 15 minutes to take the order. once the order is taken, it takes atleast 45 minutes for something to show up. and the order is just lying there for some more time for someone to come and serve. 
Best part.. Biriyani came before starters and was on the table for atleast an hour before starters were brought, served and eaten. One of the starter did not even show up.
their service is pathetic. Only go there if the restaurant is empty. If 3-4 tables are full, you better find some other place.
Group of 5 came at 12:25 and left at 2:45 with half eaten food.",1,"2018-10-05 11:09:35",17,47,0
"33093114","A new place located above AB”s.
Ordered veg and non-veg thalis.
The difference in veg and non-veg thali is egg and chicken curry only.
Nice ambience and quick service.
I mostly liked dal, sambar, rasam.
Egg curry is ok.
Chicken curry is good.
Had unlimited rice option.
I prefer that it would be better if they add podis and more non- veg items.
Overall ok.",3,"2018-10-04 14:07:25",439,1012,4
"35615038","Worst service ever I had,Wait for 1 hr for food and after that also need to cancel partial order.
They served main course first then starter and soup in the last.
And if you complain about there service to manager, he don't care and ignore you completely...
I even not give 1 star to this..",1,"2018-09-29 10:11:31",2,1,0
"52475177","This is the worst service ever i had in my life. Gave 1 star because its mandatory to give at least 1 star. Almost we waited for more than 2 hrs for food.",1,"2018-09-28 16:10:16",1,6,0
"32822178","Not worth even 1 star. Worst service and management I have ever experienced. Took lot of time to get the items we ordered, waited for more than 1 hour. Taste is also very bad. Received starters after nans and biryani. ",1,"2018-09-28 15:23:10",1,0,0
"34159987","Pathetic Service!! It took more than 20 minutes for them to approach us and take order. We waited for more than 40 min for food and lost our paitence and left the place without having food. Before leaving I have informed them that you can cancel the order as we can't wait more. There is no response from him and he didn't even bother to stop us.
Should improve a lot on service part ",1,"2018-09-11 18:48:37",2,1,0
"50351133","Came with office colleagues for lunch. We were greatly frustrated with the time that was taken to serve food. Waiting for close to an hour is not acceptable!!
Also not happy with the quantity of Soup being served, we order for soup on 1/2 basis, the quantity was really less!
Dissatisfied with our first visit",1,"2018-09-07 14:17:19",2,2,0
"30291954","The food is good and variety is decent. 
The service was really really slow. If you have to constantly look for waiter to get your food after 45 mins of order, its not the kind of experience you aim for. Definitely needs an overhaul of service before I come back again. ",1,"2018-09-07 14:10:43",2,25,0
