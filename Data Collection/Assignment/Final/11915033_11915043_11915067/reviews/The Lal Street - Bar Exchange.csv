If you wanna spend some good time with your friends, dance your heart out, and blow off some steam, The Lal Street is the place for you.",4,"2019-05-18 21:27:11",4,47,0

"34072147","I have been to this place with friends for friday night. The place has amazing vibes. They were playing awesome bollywood numbers. The place was so crowded that it's do difficult to find a place to chill. Getting a table is task. Food is also good. One advice, go a little early. You will get place and even drinks will be at decent prices.",4,"2019-05-12 16:43:28",44,867,0
"62017537","Apparently that's their garnish. Oh yeah, the orange peel on the plate. Was my drink the dustbin? Lol 😅. Oh wait, I guess maybe I never had a cocktail. That's what the waiter said. Horrible service. The guy wasn't ready to even call the manager. ",1,"2019-05-12 15:33:54",1,1,1

"773578","This place is stupid and extremely discriminating . As a guy you are not allowed to enter the dance floor . The bouncers are hostile and say that unless you have a girl , you cannot enter the dance floor . I understand there might be instances of guys Misbehaving but the attitude of the management towards people is extremely hostile . I'm never coming here",1,"2019-05-11 23:15:51",12,156,0

"111011600","The Lady Bouncer Aunty with glasses at the desk didn't allow us to go inside as we were wearing Slides. She referred the slides as 'Slippers' straight to our faces. They should've mentioned about 'Shoes' in Zomato app. I feel so sad about the half knowledge of the aunty at the Reception desk. Will never visit this place, Ever. ",1,"2019-05-10 12:31:43",1,0,0
"33851177","Friday night visited there with my girl gang. I had booked the table in order to avoid any hastle. Was seated in a quiet corner on the deck side of the space. I loved the food they served— each and every item. The DJ for that night was very good and we danced till the last song! Only the service a bit dissatisfying because the bill was generated incorrectly and over the amount what we had consumed. Expect better care to be taken !",4,"2019-05-09 22:26:20",74,63,0
"27150919","It was a night out with gal pals.
When we entered, the server took us to our sitting area , we chose a corner, as it had a couch ,felt it was bit secluded.
Warm indoors, black and brown seatings, cartoons of laal street, their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV.
They have their own app for ordering , but guess what their wifi wasn't available ,as it was under repair. That is what server told us.
The server came and took our orders.
We ordered starters and drinks.
As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere.
It kind of scared us , then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation.
Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came. The server got one of the drinks wrong, we reminded him it was changed ,he said he already brought this.
Other places, the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast. Instead he said he cant take it back.
Anyways moving on
The cocktail which i had were really good. The cosmopolitan, Beer trap and Screw driver.
The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small. I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian. Italian cheese fingers - They were crispy and yum, Stuffed mushrooms - they were okay and forgettable, the Nachos were okay , have had better ones . The crispy corn was good . Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters.
The music was good , Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it, first they said at 9.30 they will start ,then said 10.30 it will start. We four were only on the dance floor , we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song. He didnt oblige at all.
Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills ? God knows.
Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar.
Hope they improve their hospitality. That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again.

"1698772","GOOD PLACE TO HANGOUT WITH FRIENDS. NICE MUSIC NICE AMBIENCE NICE FOOD.
It also has a outdoor seating so one who likes to have that seating. it is also a good place with good atmosphere.
Its a Bar Exchange so Order wisely that's the only thing to Take Care of.
If you are traveling to hyd. and don't want to go any random place for pubbing. You surely can rely on this place. ",4,"2019-05-06 11:16:06",12,119,1
"53439650","To enter this bar, you have to go from the main entrance of the mall. There is no separate entrance to the bar directly which means that you have to pass all the people in the mall with your party wear. You may find it little bit awkward. 
Coming to the bar interior, it is spacious, different seating arrangement, outdoor included. You better book table before reaching, otherwise it would be difficult to get table on a peak time esp weekends. We booked in advance but still we didn’t get the one with sofa, we got the table with bar chairs(tall).
We ordered Singapore Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Wet and white sauce Pasta.
Singapore Noodles - 5/5
Mixed Fried Rice - 5/5
Chicken Wet - 4/5
White Sauce Pasta - 2/5
They didn’t have pizza on the day we went. 
Music- They played good English songs early and followed by hindi songs. Songs were very good.
Drinks - You have to order through their app. So we had to install and order. It was not very convenient. The price of drinks on the menu in Zomato has no relation with the actual price. Cocktails were very expensive comparing to the one it is shown on the menu.

"31287074","One of the best bars I have visited in Hyderabad so far...It has a quirky concept of
BarExchange.
Its a great place to hangout and party with ur friends, has a groovy music and a big dance floor, it also has an option of open air and this place is crowded on weekends.
It's all based on the demand and supply that day!
A large dynamic trading display board tells you what the current price for various drinks is, and shows you the highest and lowest prices for the day, in real time. All you need to do is download their app, which also shows you the trading board, and use it to place your order.

"32303631","I have ordered food couple of times from this place but never been there. Mostly I used to order thali for lunch. Which was worthy. This was my first physical visit to the restaurant. And I was very amazed to see all the glory around me. Ambience, look, coziness and lighting all were so perfect. The soft couches were so comfortable. Then moving to the food, I ordered chicken steak platter. This contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. The quantity was enough to fill the belly. Further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. Paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. It was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. In drinks I had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. I found this place very nice to hang out with friends. It is not family friendly. Staff is courteous. There are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well. Also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience. Trust me you will never be disappointed after going to this place.

What's great? Nothing.
It's a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money. Half the order doesn't come on time, you'll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time.
The fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered, too many people are stiffed inside and I don't think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract.
Overall, I liked the food and the place but it was a disappointment that night. We left to a more peaceful place for the rest of night.

Three of us girls went to this place on a rainy Friday evening and it turned out to be good fun. We ordered:
White sauce pasta: it was awesomely tasty. The sauce was made correctly with the right consistency. There were vegetables in it.
Nachos with sauce: again another yummy dish. Though the sauce was a bit less and it did not suffice until the end of Nachos, but overall the dish was delicious and worth it.
Chicken kebabs: just wow. The best dish of the evening for us. Soft, succulent with the right amount of spices and the gharwale taste jaisi dhaniya-pudina chutney made it worth the money.
We also ordered beer, virgin mojito (good) and a pineapple mocktail (very bad - pure waste of money).
It also has a good dance place. Furthermore, the dj was good and played an awesome list of bollywood numbers, to which we grooved until the end.
All in all, an awesome experience and I would have given 5 stars, but the pineapple mocktail and the seats that we got inspite of booking in advance made me deduct one star. ",4,"2019-04-13 07:55:23",36,209,0

Misal pav is great but a suggestion here. Increase the quantity of misal in the plate. The taste was real good.
Pasta was amazing. Loved the crunchiness of veggies.
Bombay sandwich - initially i was bit skeptical in my anticipation but the sandwich was exactly hiw it should be.. osum... green chutney turned its magic on..
Definitely must visit place.. ",5,"2019-04-02 18:49:28",22,12,0
"37077650","I visited this place on last Saturday and I really enjoyed the evening. The best thing which I liked about the place was only groups and couples were allowed to enter the Dancing floor which does not happen in Delhi . I really liked the food and the crowd, would love to visit again .",5,"2019-04-02 16:19:11",13,27,0

"1520298","This place is something you can never get bored off, groovy music, good food and crowd is also nice 😋 . The lal street has a big dancing floor , ambiance is pretty good and has a outside seating area also. It's very crowded on weekends like anything
Talking about the food this place is Zomato Gold Food partner. If you have it , you can enjoy the benefits
- Chicken Lolipop, crispy lolipop served with salsa sauce
- Masala Papad , stuffed masala papad rolls with coriander chutney and onion
- cheesy pineapple sticks (Never ever order this, it was pathetic) :(
- Paneer lazeez , creamy tomato onion gravy with cottage cheese (highly recommended)
- Chicken Tikka Masala (highly recommended)
- Cheese Garlic naan and butter Naan
Overall my evening at Lal was just amazing, the service was really good. You can go with your friends and family to enjoy the weekends for sure. #mydj17",4,"2019-04-01 14:29:43",201,1188,4
"398842","This was our second stop in same complex on Saturday (30/03) evening. Only reason I am giving two stars instead of zero is the rescue of situation by GM of the joint, given below so you guys decide the merits of place.
Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.
At 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... Hence the futility of all the hoopla. ",2,"2019-04-01 11:11:12",98,405,0

"56773043","Went to this place it is a nice place but customer service is not good, they accepted my table booking but later when I visit the place they did not allot me table u just have to hit the bar counter.
Note to manager- if u can't provide table just don't accept it.",1,"2019-03-31 22:30:03",3,7,0
"37477892","Ambience was good.
But food, in taste and quality, was not up to the mark.
Also the service was poor. Waiters were not waiting properly, you had to call everytime for small things like glasses or plates.",2,"2019-03-31 18:29:52",1,1,0

"1454847","First of all special mention to Santosh who really made our evening very best by his great service. He was superb in taking our orders and serving really fast. Thank you Santosh for it.
Now coming to F&B, though little priced on high end, it was worth it. Every thing we ordered in Veg, Non Veg and Drinks (Mocktails) we're really good... Music was lovely, ambience was perfect and above all I believe Wednesday is Ladies Night... So all the girls / ladies you know one place to go as well, if you didn't know so far like me... :-)
Overall... Very well spent time and gathered loads of memories as always... Will go again for sure... Just waiting for a reason, if not will make one ... :-)",5,"2019-03-28 12:14:29",78,76,3
"39118650","Even though this place is huge, we couldn't find a place to sit initially. Around 10.30 we finally got a place to sit. The food and the bar here is good and service was prompt (once you get a table). The DJ played some nice Bollywood songs. Overall it's a nice place but I'd recommend to book a table before you go here if you are planning to visit on weekends. ",4,"2019-03-27 00:27:35",50,69,0
"36295431","The DJ who plays at this place is really good. We went in a group of 10 people and enjoyed a lot. On the downside, the food and drinks service is really slow and number of waiters are less as compared to seating strength of the place.
The people on bar counter suck big time as they don't talk properly, give you respect and try to loot you by saying half of the low price drinks are not available.",3,"2019-03-24 13:34:28",26,17,0
"33029244","The Lal Street is been good for the first time. Today I went and booked a table, where we have not been given a table and was asked to stand at the bar. Then after a wait of nearly 40mins staff arranged the table for us, where there was no-one to entertain us and take our order. We sat for around another half hour requesting the waiters to take our order. Then suddenly being Saturday night, the music went so so loud that it started hurting our ears and we were not able to talk even sitting side by side. Everyone want their Saturday night to be groovy but the music was literally hurting our ears. No doubt music played by DJ was awesome that it was making everyone dance on the floor.
Food was fine though but ambience is good.",3,"2019-03-23 22:30:48",4,3,1
"47142726","Good place to hangout when you buddies and pals. Dj just turns on the dance floor. Place gets over crowded in weekends but the ambience makes you to stay and enjoy your drink.",5,"2019-03-21 14:03:57",4,5,0
"1678019","What an ambience. It was a Saturday evening on which we visited this place.
It has got that stock market price fluctuation system for beverages. We could order ourselves from the app.
The Lal Street (to be read as Dalal street where the stock exchange is actually listed). 
In terms of food, we ordered two preparations,
Cheese Chilly Toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies.
The Lal Special Pizza was not upto the mark. (coming from a reviewer from Kolkata)
If you hit the right price, alcohol can be really cheap. We ordered Black Dog Triple Gold Reserve for around 180 INR. 
It's definitely a bang on party place which requires a little improvement when it comes to food.",4,"2019-03-19 09:14:09",65,375,2

"15560947","The best thing about TLS is it's dj. Dj played a good collection of songs, it has a separate dance floor which is a major plus point. The ambience is good, food is above average and service is prompt.

"20204926","Visited here Saturday evening, place was full crowded and it took time to get a table though I've booked online.

"31100215","The pricing here will be an interesting one to see! The higher the drinks get sold, the more the price is. Ambience looks decent and the dance floor is big.
Starters menu is good, we had cheese balls and chicken started. The pricing seems to be expensive on Starters compared to other similar restaurants. ",4,"2019-03-10 17:07:53",16,5,0
"1263748","Place was a complete let down. Was there for lunch on Sunday and was disappointed. The veg stack in the western section was actually a spicy paneer which was basically spicy filling between 2 slices of paneer and topped with a chilli sauce. 2 dishes took 40 mins to come while 1 was served in 12 mins. Staff were lost and seemed to be recovering from a late night on Saturday. The only saving grace were the drinks. So unless you want to go and just have a drink and then more drinks, skip the place.",2,"2019-03-10 16:53:17",40,54,0

"44322526","Been here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was quite empty as it was afternoon.

The service was below par, the order supposed to be done by the app. Turns out, the app doesn’t work and had to wait for an hour before we got to know.
