Coming to ordered one ghee sambar rice worst ever that too without ghee and sambar is of watered samabar which complementary sambar will get along with idly in small restauarnts And ragi sangati natu kodi pulusu cheated with regular chicken and sangati is not wel mixed less of rafi malt and full of rice.

Took 45 mins to accept order
Took another  50 mins to deliver.When we checked with delivery guy, he updated me they start cooking after delivery guy reached restaurant. During this time when I called restaurant, those guys keep telling me 10 more mins every time.
Finally when food was delivered chicken was not boiled properly, biriyani is not that good.Palow was just ok. Not worth of trying even cost is pocket friendly.",1,"2018-07-16 15:24:20",1,0,0
