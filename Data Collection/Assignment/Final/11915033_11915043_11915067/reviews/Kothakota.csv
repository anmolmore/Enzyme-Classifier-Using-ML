"1904466","Nice place to hangout. Had chicken seekulu which tasted good and chicken mirchi bajji which is almost the feel of mirchi bajji with chicken kheema inside. It also tasted nice. There are many other options which I would like to try next time",3,"2018-11-03 07:00:45",156,726,2

"849785","Placed in the newly open smack drive-in had a lot of expectations on this place.
I did not want to post the first review as a negative one but I feel feedback would help them change tried their mutton sekhulu which was bad in taste and probably the mutton was also terrible. Overall a disaster.",1,"2018-08-20 21:00:59",1031,1653,0
