"52137531","Noodle Bar used to be one of my favorite places to hangout in DLF.
Though the quality and quantity are okay when you dine in at the restaurant.
But delivery from Zomato is horrible.
Have ordered Momo's twice but the quality was poor both the times. And it has degraded to an extent that I will never order from here again.
Also they are charging extra.
Veg Momos is priced 60 in the restaurant but here it is 75 bucks.",1,"2019-05-11 22:50:42",84,368,0

"83825014","I love this place. The combos are good and mouth watering.
The price is also justified. The best dish is lollipops.
Will be visiting here more to try out their other dishes. ",5,"2019-04-29 19:50:36",3,1,0

Previously they used to give momos and pasta. I must say I was a fan of their chinese pasta. 
The footfall at the restaurant is a testament to the fact the deliciousness that is served over there.
The food is priced right with the authenticity  intact. And the secret lies in using good quality sauces.
They  dont compromise on quality and that is what have kept them in the business and growing. 
Everything is at best over here. 
My personal favorite, Soya honey chilli chicken and I am heading right now to have one.
Less is More, so no need to say more!

"39819841","I have ordered twice from Noodle Bar through Zomato and I am in absolute love with this place.
It's very hard to find reasonably priced authentic Indian Chinese food in Gachibowli. And I finally found that place. I am yet to visit the restaurant, but I hope I'll do that soon.
This place is just perfect for my Chinese food cravings.
Both the items I tried were Chicken Chilly combos. My choice of sauces were hot garlic sauce and soy honey chilly sauce. I ordered it with fried rice. They have options for noodles too. I still can't decide which one I liked more, because both of them were SO good.
The fried rice had quite a number of chicken pieces, the chilly chicken was super delicious with lots of capsicum, onions and chicken in it. Usually fast food centers or small restaurants tend to put a lot of batter while frying the chicken. But this one was more of soft and tender chicken with a thin layer of batter.
If you stay nearby, I highly recommend trying out food from this place. They have a limited menu, but quality matters more than quantity!

"33568646","A casual hangout..!
Weâ€™ve tried fried veg momo, veg noodles with gravy Manchuria and burnt garlic egg noodles. 
The taste of the food was good but Momoâ€™s were oily. 
A pocket friendly place. ðŸ™‚",3,"2019-04-24 05:19:10",85,917,5
"57559588","I had ordered fried noodles in garlic sauce along with chilly chicken. What I received was normal noodles mixed with garlic sauce and paneer pieces. Never order in this restaurant",1,"2019-04-20 06:00:03",1,0,0
"46473227","One of the best noodles I have ever had. Truly, they are the connoisseurs of chinese dishes at pocket friendly rates. Unlike other wannabe chinese food outlets who add curry leaves in fried rice/noodles, or add wrong ingredients messing up the dishes in one way or the other, these guys know what they are doing.",5,"2019-04-16 13:23:52",9,1,0
"14541441","This place is located just before TCS office at DLF,beside Coconut Juice Bar. Run entirely by north-east experts of cooking, the food will taste and next to authentic is not a bad guess. Don't expect to get a place to sit or get a great ambience if you are visiting during peak times. Enjoy the food and you will not be coming back home being unsatisfied.
I have had momos, noodles, rice and chicken side dishes from here. I love the taste. I love the way they prepare and serve the food. Take your bowl, stand there and enjoy!
Must Try: Momos, rice, noodles, chili honey potato, chicken in soya-honey sauce which goes well with spicy schezwan rice/noodles.
Pocket Pinch: Your tummy will be full and satisfied and so does your wallet. 300 bucks for two if you are going for main course and side dishes, beside starters.
Payments : cash, card or Gpay but they charge 5% extra if you pay via card, god knows for what reasons.
Cons: You have to be on your toe to place yout orders, stand and see if they are properly sent to the cook. Or else, a simple order can make you wait for hours during peak.",4,"2019-04-14 16:40:42",685,792,4
"8855061","Noodles love go get it ! You should have better judgment of choosing a dish before you order! It was really a quite place in that foodie junction road. Tastes good and could have been more better than expected.",4,"2019-04-10 21:16:10",8,123,0
"16750381","Lovely place with really tasty food and an amazing staff. The place is usually crowded but there is a lot of place to sit in the back. The food here is cheap in terms of cost (Honey Chilli Potato for 70â‚¹ is great) but it is really tasty and it's good quality too. Great options for Vegetarians too. Noodles were quite amazing too and the overall food quality, presentation and quantity is great. We tried the Honey Chilli Potato, Schezwan Potato, Burnt Garlic Fried Noodles and weren't disappointed by anything. Surely deserves a recommendation and I'll go there to keep trying all the dishes.",5,"2019-04-02 13:03:05",5,1,1
"764741","This place is perfect for Chinese food lovers. Next to authentic taste of Chinese food at decent price. Good place to hangout. The only problem is the place is too crowded for its size. And that, I think, explains the quality of the food here.",5,"2019-03-27 03:47:44",55,108,0
"98113210","I had honey chilli potato,schezaun rice and noodle Manchurian combo.The honey chilli potato was more crispy than at other places,rice was tasty would be better accompanied with manchurian ,noodle combo was good.",3,"2019-03-10 23:46:13",10,0,3
"34826982","Forget ambience, forget music! If you are a foodie, Noodle bar is the place for you. Located in the middle of an array of street food outlets, it can be identified as the busiest on that street. And why not! The food is super yumm and very light on pocket. My favourites are Thupka and steamed Momos (served with in-house mayo and schzewan sauce). Honey chilli potato is another dish on the menu that I would recommend. ",5,"2019-03-10 23:10:43",2,9,0
"34866082","If you are looking for some nice desi chinese with pocket friendly price, then look no further than noodle bar. Small joint but amazing food with descent quantity. Tried their chicken steamed momos and chicken chili combo rice. ",4,"2019-03-04 21:30:13",43,314,2
"677679","Noodle bar is a small eatery in the lanes of DLF building and is one of the hidden gems in Hyderabad.
The cooks of this restaurant are great in their skill and they present you with lip smacking Chinese food.
I have been here numerous number of times with my friends and we are still short of words for this place.
The chefs (cooks from North East India) puts full dedication in making those dishes and I can vouch that you would like every dish of this place.
Some mention worthy dishes which we loved are : Fried momos, Honey chilli potato, schezwan noodles, vegetables soup.
This place is only open at night and they don't deliver at your homes, so find a chance to visit this place and try our their amazing food. ",5,"2019-02-10 12:17:37",328,1858,0

The noodles is soft and non sticky while is honey chili potatoes is crunchy and tasty. Other options also include thukpa and momos.

"132958","Easily one of the best Chinese eateries around DLF. Serves freshly made tasty & scrumptious Chinese grub at reasonable prices. None of those harmful spice or chilli powders, they let their sauces speak for them and they are the bomb!
My regular fare is the Veg Momos & Egg Fried Rice. Their Momos are good if inconsistent at times; steamed ones better than fried. The real kicker is the hot sauce that is served alongside. Itâ€™s sticky tangy fiery goodness. 
Their noodles are of the thin variety, something very rare amongst Chinese eateries in town. They also have Wok Combos - rice or noodles, served with gravy of your choice - Paneer, chicken or manchurian in Schezwan, Hot Garlic, Soya or Honey Chilli sauces. My pick is the Chilly Paneer hot garlic sauce with egg fried rice. 
Prices are very reasonable, 60/70 bucks for normal fried rice or noodles & 100/120 for combos. Thereâ€™s always a good crowd so one has to wait a while but their order taking and serving system is quite efficient so youâ€™ll get your grub in time. ",5,"2019-01-25 03:55:28",166,459,1
"31193333","The best place to have pocket friendly, hygeinic, tasty and really well made street-style Chinese food. The egg-drop soup, chicken momos and burnt garlic noodles make a perfect meal. The noodles are light, and thin unlike other places we know. I've been here countless times now, and will keep coming back for more :)",5,"2019-01-20 19:55:23",7,44,0
