"2730688","Not worth it at all. Paid 500‚Çπ just to end up eating curd rice for the night .
Went here last night, got a table for 3.
The service was extremely poor and slow .
The waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
He was the only one around .. wearing a CSK T shirt.
When the starters started arriving I was shocked
The starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. Un bearable.
For a person who has stayed in Hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how Hyderabadi food tastes.
Mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
Fish wasn't cooked
Chicken was toooo spicy
Crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
Potato Cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad
Panner didn't arrive at all
Water arrived
Left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
Biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora
Settled for curd rice
Icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
Icecream was good but The gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry
When I was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. I had a bite .. it was ok
But I had enough already
Everyone around my table were complaining too..
But no use ..
Useless place
Never again",2,"2019-05-11 14:36:50",7,110,2

"43519958","It was an absolute delight to visit this place. For starters, being a North Indian, I absolutely digged the Punjabi tracks that played for the entire evening. Kudos! Coming to food: The menu was pretty limited and the service of food was slow but that didn't stop them from overloading us with literally every dish. The quality and taste were both up to the mark. I absolutely loved the hospitality. The staff was really courteous and actually enjoyed serving us and made us eat more than we wanted. The crispy corn and Grilled pineapple were a total delight. The price was very decent for the quality and ambience and ideal to have a small gathering. The mocktails/cocktails were good too. All in all, a memorable experience. Looking forward to visiting again. Cheers!",4,"2019-03-16 01:28:44",4,19,0
