"55675686","I have ordered looking at the rating, it was almost 11:15pm so that the order delivers before the time. 11:45pm i haved called the Zomato valet to enquire about the order status he said that he will reach the cakesclub in 2 mins to pick the order and said he will reach the place on time.
I again called the valet at 11:55pm looking the order status is still being prepared and valet informed me that the resturant is not yet prepared the cake. The cakes are always preserved well in advance, so why does the restaurant took so much time to handover the cake.
At around 12:10am the order is delivered and went inside. I opened the packing with great excitement and finally looking at the cake situation i was shocked and disappointed, it is like the face of Oberyn Martell crushed by Mountain in GOT only the hardcore fans can understand it.
I said okay inside and asked my brother to cut the cake but the taste of cake is not at all okay and it is melted and moved from the cake base.
Very much disappointed , think twice before placing the order.",1,"2019-04-30 01:09:39",6,1,1

"58100124","Hello friends..Please don‚Äôt order this cake ever. This is one of the worst cake we ever had. And its not a cool cake..its more hard than a regular. A plum cake that we buy in a grocery store would taste much better. ",1,"2019-03-24 17:38:01",1,0,1

"47296206","Without a doubt the best value for money in terms of taste and money(got in offer by Zomato Tastyüòù)
Just loved the idea of mini cake the moment I saw it as its was well crafted and ordered the DEATH BY CHOCOLATE MINI CAKE immidiately and have to admit it ROCKED!! in taste and presentation inside out
Whenever there is a small party and cake is just for cutting and having small bites then this would make a perfect choice in for taste, size and money.
One thing for cakesclub.com, U guys have nailed with this idea. Try to expand the menu in this area and surely u guys are gonna rockü§ò",5,"2019-02-03 00:32:16",2,2,4
