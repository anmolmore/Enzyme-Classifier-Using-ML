Food tastes great! Menu is very well defined and have good amount of combos.

"47874606","Despite having a prior booking ... They made us sit in the last ,where the AC wasn't sufficient .
The management was too ignorant ... Said the same thing multiple times all to deaf ears .
There's nothing that was too good about it.
The food was below average and too pricy for the portion and taste they serve.
Won't recommend.",1,"2019-04-27 16:18:03",1,4,0

"262271","Came here with my Family after 2-3 months and ordered usual chinese combo . They have changed their menu and made it more south Indian than continental like before .  In chinese combo they gave us noodles topped with Paneer 65 ( with all curry patta and mustard seeds) This use to be my go to place until last year because of the freindly staff and variety in continental menu .  They changed their menu and the new taste is not worth it. ",2,"2019-03-15 21:49:15",1,49,0

Price was quiet high but quantity was also more with a very good taste. To be honest, we were done for that day. Side dish was also nice.

Ordered the Thai green curry, was just a watery mess, probably the worst ever had.
Kung Pao chicken was overly sweet, the noodles were just tossed around in a few eggs and probably 2 pieces of chicken.
The rice was very dry giving us an overall average experience.",2,"2019-02-10 12:46:56",186,13392,4

"34147768","This is one of the best dining place situated near Wipro circle . Since it's near by to our waverock site it's easily accessible .good place to hangout . Decent staff , good food .chicken steak is the one you must try .would have been in this for more than 10-15 time trying out different food .
So every time we go we use Zomato Zomato code which one of the best option here .but last time when I went they have removed it since the contract is over .
Wish you @deli9 team should consider Zomato again which will allow to enjoy more food and suggest other . Totally a good experience .

"32022325","Had a very disappointing experience. The place didn't do justice to it's rating. I don't know what happened, maybe the chef had a bad day or maybe that's how the food generally is. Ordered fries with cheese which was poorly seasoned, the fish in fish and chips was literally dripping in oil. There didn't seem any effort put into the Potato wedges that come on the side of the burger. The service was good.. if only food was half as decent!",2,"2019-01-17 19:03:14",23,74,0
"41518306","Among all the dishes I have tried there, Cottage steak was the one which stood well for me. They serve this with cottage tikki, barbecue sauce (which was going really well in combo).

"16097008","I had been to this place after long time last night for dinner. I must say the ambience is still so marvelous. Each wall has something interesting by itself. A great place for photography. Coming to the food. We ordered:
1. Bull frog
2. Fanta
3. Pepper chicken bao
4. Ginger chicken bao
5. Fish and chips
6. Cajun chicken breast sizzler
The bao's are a must try. Both of them were yummy. Fish and chips were in the same category as well but this time the fish wasn't that great. Coming to the sizzler...i felt chicken was a little hard and the veges needed a pinch of salt. A little bland for my taste. Other than that everything was good.",4,"2019-01-12 15:21:06",94,496,6
"34166483","A very cool place to hang around. I am a fan of their food and beverages. They will not disappoint you with any of their dishes. I think their Mocktails and coffee menu should grow now. Having the same standard stuff will become monotonous for regular customers because they are not very great! However, their soups and desserts are to die for.. Overall, I always had a good experience at this place. Staff is friendly and patient, but not good at suggesting you what to order. :D",4,"2019-01-11 22:40:03",60,54,3

"29664601","I recently visited here for lunch with my office team mates . The food was really good, and the staff were polite and quick to respond. The ambience was pretty pleasing too.
One issue with this place is that the parking area is really really cramped. It is small, and since it is shared with the other eateries in the same building, parking your car can be a bit of a headache here. ",4,"2019-01-05 13:11:33",2,1,0

"847015","This place is Gold if you want a good dining experience in financial district. Amid all the star hotels and big names, this place has made its mark. It is not cheap but thats fine, considering the portions they serve and taste. You will be done with one burger or a rice/roti with a curry. Zomato Gold comes to your rescue if you have one. I like simple chicken burger and lemonade. Burger come with some potato wedges, salad. ",5,"2018-12-26 18:39:42",13,5,0
"1291095","Deli9 has a lots of good food to offer and that's why I flock the place pretty frequently. My favorite here is their Pan Fried Fish steak sizzler (if you are not a fan of sizzlers, request them and they would serve it sans the fanfare). Tried their grilled tenderloin steak as well, but it did not live upto the expectations. It was dry and chewy sadly. Their pastas are quite tasty (we tried ours in pink sauce), so are their pizzas (we tried garden veg). If you like fish and chips, try it out here, will not be disappointed. Their cold coffee isn't that great, bitter and watery (I like the creamy and balanced kind). If you like mocktails, I would suggest that you leave out the Ginger Lime fizz. It's a poor version of our limca. The mojitos here are pretty refreshing though. ",4,"2018-12-24 23:25:03",84,511,9
"47686673","Tried the chicken stuffed steak and the fish steak which were genuinely impressive. Not only were the waiters friendly, they had fast service as well. With the Zomato Gold membership I could avail the 1 + 1 offer which destroyed my hunger pangs!",5,"2018-12-22 18:56:24",12,11,2

"1903288","Been here quite a number of times and have tried their varitey of burgers, pizzas and grilled chicken. My all time favourites have been cajun marinated chicken breast and tex-mex burger. It is just the way they cook the meat that it becomes succulent and juicy without losing any of its flavors. I would highly recommend the tex-mex burger. Delicious cheese and patty with vegetables makes one hell of a bite. Their pizzas are also taste worthy. Despite being a non-vegetarian, I really enjoyed their garden veg pizzas with their thin crusts and generous toppings.¬†
Besides the food, their service is quick and the ambiance is definitely something you can enjoy with your friends and colleagues even on a weekday.
Highly recommended if you are in the area near Wipro circle Gachibowli.¬†

As I was using Zomato gold the waiter insisted a place orders for both the dishes together which I haven‚Äôt heard anywhere before. After some question the waiter agreed. The quantity of the prawns were underwhelming although the raat was good. Then ordered chicken lasagna which is a safe bet here along with cold coffee.

The food is the best part about the place. Inspite of offering multiple cuisines ranging from thai to Italian to continental to indian and lebanese.. they seem to get the balance perfectly right. ",4,"2018-11-18 22:44:37",59,265,0

"2319082","I visited this place on a weekday in the evening to have a snack.
- Ambience was good. Service was prompt and responsive.
- I ordered Pineapple lemonade, cheesy fries and chicken burger.
Liked the cheesy fries (with mustard sauce)and burger.
Overall good place to hangout and have a snack. Will visit this place again. :)",4,"2018-11-18 11:38:49",12,2,2
"47129960","This place never disappoints me. Never. Totally love the nachos chaat in the starters- prepared warm, crispy with right dose of sour and sweet flavours. Paav bhaji is also very good. In main course, their paneer bhurji combo is my all time favourite. Also must try is Lasagna at this place. Byw, I love how they give you good quantity of food as well. The staff is super courteous.",5,"2018-11-18 01:02:26",13,13,0

"50041366","the ambiance of the restaurant is very spacious and good. The service is very fast before you know you order is on your table. Must be very careful about the¬† quantity of the dishes. we went for Green peas veg soup. it was delicious¬† and heart-filling. in the main course, we went for punjab puttar (veg) it was delicious and sufficient for 3 people. we went for a fish main it was a very very spicy and a huge disappointment. Our overall experience was good, but not great.",4,"2018-11-12 19:48:27",22,52,0

"506651","Lol. I paid 345 bucks for what tasted like ready made pasta without any salt in it, along with a tiny, flaky piece of bread (that had neither butter nor garlic) wrapped in aluminium foil. I've seen more effort from places that charge 200 bucks for a dish. It was BAD. I counted three pieces of capsicum, total. Most half-assed pasta I've had in years. Super disappointed.",1,"2018-11-03 17:14:33",43,96,0
"3041846","This is one of the best cafes around in the area with a wide variety of options on the menu. Singaporean chilli prawn and keema pav here are the always opt of in doubt! The ambience is also pretty cool and the service is impressive. A must visit place for hanging out. ",5,"2018-11-01 21:02:33",8,2,0
"29890004","Overall a 4.5 experience.
This place has an nice warm ambience. As their tower burger isn't available we have ordered Chicken Burger along with Lamb Pizza and Lasagne. The burger was amazing the patty was so juicy and was perfect. The pizza was also good. The lasagne was a tad bit disappointing as it was felt grainy in the mouth but tasted delicious. The service was very prompt. Would love to visit this place again.",4,"2018-11-01 10:21:57",41,141,5
"2412670","More is not always merrier, hot dog with lettuce and tomatoes was tasting more like a sub sandwich, although after removing the veggies it tasted really nice.
Home style potato wedges were a good attempt but a little too bland.
Penne pasta was overcooked but the sauce had not soaked in all flavours hence tasted a undercooked.
Best part was the desert, old fashioned pastry which was not too sweet and not too chocolate.
Overall experience was goodsince the staff is very considerate and ambience is very comforting",3,"2018-11-01 04:22:32",92,276,5
"30307683","Deli 9 Bistro is in front of Holiday inn express and suites hence becomes a perfect fit to order some dinner.
I have ordered one Veggie 9 burger and tried Shawarma wrap and Deli 9 Bistro garden veg pizza in the restaurant it self.
Veggie 9 burger - 3.5/5
Deli 9 Bistro garden Pizza -4.5/5
Shawarma wrap - 3/5
Pizza was very good .It was a thin crust pizza with cheese,sauces and veggies on top of it.
Burger had a Patty with cheese and some Vegetables like cucumber,tomatoes and onions.I found the burger pretty average.
With both burger and wrap,they give some wedges and salad complementary.When I ordered then as well as when I went to their restaurant,the wedges were cold and dry and they were disgusting.I can understand if it was only in the case when I ordered food but how can the restaurant give the customer who have come for dining already prepared wedges.That was seriously not expected from Deli 9 Bistro!!!",3,"2018-11-01 00:03:36",179,1874,5
"31705472","Deli 9 bistro is one of the good find in this area for us.
We have been looking for a place like this near our office from quite a long and usually had to compromise with some ok places for lunch, but if you are also working around this place then deli 9 bistro is a place which will serve you variety of food options with satisfied palate.
The ambiance of this place is pretty nice, a place to have a conversation with your meal.
The staff is polite and friendly and very professional.
Their menu has food almost everything mood of yours, the portion size is decent and taste is also pretty good.
Kashmiri kebab platter and thai curry rice is good to have.
Looking forward to try more dishes and update the review.",4,"2018-10-27 02:03:05",100,275,4

"31929629","It's all about Food, a small and a ambience filled with memories and good times. Deli9bistro has been revamping it's menu across most of their outlets. From burgers to rice bowls and Noodle bowls too, they've got it all. But once in a while we like to sit back over the amazing Orange Frioska that they whip up and the Mangalore Fried Chicken. Deli9 bistro has some amazing cakes, Burgers and a whole lot of varities to choose from the Menu. A Must Visit place although there is a confusion of choice I clearly declare this as a winner for me. 4/5 is my liking",4,"2018-10-10 13:52:51",128,5520,41

"35767139","Their food quality was not upto the mark. Blue berry cheese cake did not taste like cheese cake. Also they do not honour the terms of Zomato gold. Some people have pointed out earlier too on this point. They gave us the third highest priced dish complimentary saying that they have decided to give discount depending on which order the food was ordered. Haven‚Äôt heard any other restaurant give this senseless reason. They refused to correct their billing even after we pointed out their mistake. Overall a bad experience.",1,"2018-10-08 14:03:45",7,8,0
