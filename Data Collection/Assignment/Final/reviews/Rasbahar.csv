"43041458","A very decent place with calm ambience serving only south Indian food. Ordered chole bhature,rawa dosa,Uttapam, rasmalai,masala onion dosa and rabri. All food were average, not that good but but but the rabri was super duper yummy. Liked I totally loved that Matka rabri",4,"2019-03-28 10:44:56",161,1195,6
"101748626","An exceptional cheat!Â 
If you've ordered multiple items with different quantities, you may expect a few missing ones! Nearly cost me my job on Holi when I had ordered some sweets at work for myself and a few managers.
The quality was neither that great compared to the hefty price they charge. Also, they have some tie-ups with the delivery agencies wherein, although your request for a refund on the missing items, they bluntly say ""No"".
On Layman Terms -Â  ""Avoid ordering from this establishment, There are so many other restaurants which provide average sweets at a lesser price.""
Thanks.",1,"2019-03-21 18:55:09",1,0,0

We ordered samosa and few sweets . The samosa is really good. The masala was also not spicy.kaju katli also tasted good.",4,"2019-02-02 19:53:23",127,272,2
"34182399","Place looks good but need to think if you are planning to visit or order chat items. U will be highly disappointed and waste money for items that are not actual and will be different. I ordered pav bhaji and they served pav with veg Curry which is watery and has beans, onions, green peas and tomato. When questioned on why veg Curry is served instead vof bhaji owner replied they get items from Karachi bakery....",1,"2019-01-23 15:06:28",7,1,1
"52933383","I have taken ajmer kalakand at the store.. For 250gms he told that I would get 7 pieces. So I have taken 500gms.. I have not checked while he was weighing. When I returned home and checked the box there were only 10 pieces.. I had to reorder online same sweet of 250gms again.. Then I got 7 pieces. It is better you don't cheat the customer. Customer is not looking at the weighing as he has trust on you.please don't let it be considered as advantage.. However the quality of the sweets is good. ",2,"2019-01-18 10:54:19",6,1,0
"2302452","Was disappointed beyond words. Haven't eaten a worse chole bhature or pav bhaji ever. That thing that was served can't be called chole even, it was blackened (over cooked and stored for a long time) chana floating in water with some onions. The bhaji was chopped veggies in some red color masala.

"51804254","Recently ordered food from Rasbahar. I love the food from this place, since I've been there before and thought I'll get the same quality food if I order as well. Ive ordered twice through Zomato. Both times I was highly disappointed. The first time there was nothing in my aloo tikki except for tikki and some curd and the next time the Pav was soggy, oil from bhaaji had literally spilled all over my dessert. Even if I've made multiple rounds to this shop because I like their sweets, somehow the quality seems to be highly compromised when it comes to online delivery. I hope they stop having separate standards for the food ordered online food ordered in the restaurant.",1,"2018-07-31 22:58:05",1,5,0

Good place for vegetarians & sweet lovers. Lovely range of sweets and mouthwatering chats. We ordered samosas, puri sabji, dahi puri, raj kachori, kesar rabri & jalebi. The chat in specific is pretty chatpata and reminds of the flavors from the north. The aloo sabji served with puri is delicious & filling. Raj kachori & dahi puri were awesome beyond words specially the ones with a sweet tooth will love it. Rabri & jalebi are an enjoyable treat as well. We definitely relished the food.

"4502511","Situated right beside the Indiranagar Karachi Cafe lane near Dominoes is this South Indian cum spiced up chat restaurant that caters to your hungry munch on a regular weekday evening office -to-home routine. The prices are quite reasonable and the taste is good with a sizeable portion. Karachi Cafe just happens to be a sister concern of Rasbahar and while the latter serves only Vegetarian dishes , the former caters to Non Veg tastes in Pastas and Bergurs.
We ordered : Sambhar Idly, Masala Dosa from Rasbahar and a Nonveg ""Kheema Ghotala Bergur"" from Karachi Cafe next to it. There happens to be outdoor seating as well so you can order from both at a time and have it outside on the patio or in any one of them.
The Sambhar Idly was a serving of a big flat bowl with a good quantity of Sambhar and 4 idlis floating on the top. The Sambhar tasted fresh and delicious and the idlis were soft and filling. The dosa was succulent too and can be a part of the must South Indian order.
The burger deserves a special mention as it was served with potato chips and salad and the Keema itself was tastefully done with the right amount of cheese and filling.
The snack quantity was decent and should be definitely be visited once to have a taste of both Italian and Indian.
A note to Karachi Cafe management : kindly acomodate Pizza in your menu, that is the only absence not doing justice to the Italian menu. ",4,"2017-11-30 15:16:44",77,669,19
