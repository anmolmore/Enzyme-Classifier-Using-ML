"75045788","I ordered paneer butter masala along with phulka. Paneer Butter Masala was as good as its cost but the phulka was not upto the mark. It felt like plain chapati which we can get in Rs 6 each at local outlets. The restaurant should either improve the quality or lower the price of phulka.",3,"2018-10-08 02:57:02",2,0,0
