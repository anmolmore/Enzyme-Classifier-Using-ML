"40223276","Chinese lovers should definitely visit this place. The Shanghai rolls are the best here. I have tried those rolls elsewhere too, but this place provides the best. Also try Manchurian here.",5,"2019-04-23 22:54:05",6,1,0
"54200137","Food was not good at all. This is definitely not Chinese and the chicken manchurian had only red chilli powder and no other smell. I had ordered from swiggy and chicken soft noodles was one of the best seller so I ordered that but I can tell please do not try noodles from this place. Zomato shows 3.5 rating because all the fake reviews, I believe none of them got satisfied with the food from this place.",1,"2019-04-19 22:43:23",2,1,0

"60819590","I ordered food which was accepted and showed 'your food is being prepared' for almost 25 minutes and then I get a message that my order has been declined.... my concern here is if it had to be declined it should be done in the beginning and not after 25 minutes of ordering.
