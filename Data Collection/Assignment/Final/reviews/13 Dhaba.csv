Packaging is nice although not separate. Food can't be stored, supposed to be eaten as and when ordered as both dal and rice are packed together.¬†

"711555","Outlet was once a treat for the Punjabi dishes, but over the period of time, the quality is going down and the so-called ‚Äògoooooddessst‚Äô taste has been missing the mark more than once. 
Yesterday ordered for one portion of puri-choley and one portion of puri-alu. The puris were fat and oily. The alu curry was more like hing(asafoetida) Curry and had to dig through the gravy for choley. Our breakfast was definitely spoiled. In my last order of Rajma-chawal, same thing had happened. I really had to search for the rajmas in the gravy.
Wish the management will work upon the food quality. Because at this rate, they‚Äôre losing out on loyal customers.",1,"2019-04-07 09:46:19",9,64,0

In the mood for some authentic Punjabi food, headout to 13 Dhaba to taste lipsticking and finger licking food. My personal favorite is the Dal Makhani. The combos are worth a special mention here.

On My Plate: Buttery Aloo Paratha||Paneer Makhani||Raita
The Paratha that you see is just one half of the entire paratha. So imagine how ginormous is. The stuffing was perfect, neither too less, nor too much. The paneer was very softly cooked and absorbed the flavors of the spices, and the gravy too was amazing.

"53505944","Amazing taste. Ordered Chole, Paneer dish and almost all the Naans. Quantity is also good compared to the price. Lassi and Milk Thandai were not so good. But the most important thing why I wouldn't rate it high is it's self service policy. The place is too small and even water isn't served. Not even tissue papers. ",3,"2018-08-26 20:45:49",2,3,0

"30940686","Got to know about this by watching uber eats vedio and mouth publicity.  Perfect place for a punjabi family and AUTHENTIC punjabi food lovers.
The paneer tikka I had here is the Best I ever had till date, it was totally cooked and servered with butter over. Paratas are huge enought to serve one and tests your appettite, stuffing is very good served with butter over and masala ratia. 
Reccommend to go with a group so that you can taste all togeather. 
Combos and different rice items available. Special 10%  discount for bicycle and bullet riders.  Self service so get your food own service is too good the person treat with huge respect. Worth visiting the place. ",4,"2018-08-22 21:27:31",144,1087,4

Reminded me of Arora aunty ke parathe in safdarjung, Delhi. The rajma chawal is also PERFECT. Guys, dimaag mat lagao... if you miss good food, chup chaap order from here.
