A must visit for arabian food lovers. ",5,"2017-09-01 17:26:54",1,0,0
"4743521","It was high time that this place got its due. Its one of those places which in my opinion serve best of shawarmas in the city at least according to my taste buds. Its evident from the fact that the very little people who know about this place are dedicated customers of this place and this place also caters to the most customers in the DLF area. 
Its a true delightful experience to have shawarma's here and you can never one for your taste buds will crav for more. 
The shawarma served here has  distinctive taste which lingers much after you gave had it. Its the perfect amalgamation of texture, taste and quality. The succulent chicken shreds with a layover of spices makes it irresistible. Priced on the dearer side than the counterparts in Tolichowki and elsewhere, it still is Value for Money.
