It’s a small joint located just near Golf View Apartments in Nanakramguda. The place has become one of my favorites since I had the Turkish chicken for the first time, at my friend’s house. 
Our order is always constant and limited to Peri peri Barbeque Chicken, Turkish grilled Chicken both of which never fail to disappoint. Don’t go by the name peri-peri but both of them are pretty spicy and will be delivered with a small portion of bread. 
In case you live in areas around Gachibowli/ Nanakramguda, definitely a place for chicken lovers. 
Delivery Time – well for my place its max 30 min 
Food Packaging – they do it nicely in plastic boxes and close it with a tape to keep
Food portion – probably something that can be improved 
Food taste – do warm it before having and just keep some lemon handy 
Overall – 4 
Vale for Money – 4",4,"2019-01-31 19:30:28",124,874,0

"30136282","Beginning with starters they were good mainly peri peri chicken was good with roti’s, starters are only good here , biryani was not on greater note . The staff was not responsive and management is very slow , we visited that place on Friday at lunch time he took almost 1/2hr to get biryani . Everything was slow in here management should improve response time and take order’s and deliver them at time ",3,"2018-10-01 12:01:02",9,43,0

I ordered crispy burger which was not crispy, not fresh and not tasty. French fries were soggy and old. After taking two bites, i had to throw the food away and make maggi for lunch",1,"2018-09-25 00:22:33",40,32,0

"15240961","I am writing this review with utter grief that this place is one of the loved placed for grill. Recently I had ordered a quarter place chicken as it was the best seller and I had order it again increasing the quantity to half but I got the same portion. While reporting to restaurant it seems they have send me right portion and Zomato too claimed the same. I have really very unhappy with this service. I felt cheated. I am attaching the photo group. I hope the team looks into this.",1,"2018-09-12 22:06:41",59,197,1

"33906369","If you like Arabian style chicken then this is the place u should go. Grill chicken and Peri Peri chicken is must try. They will serve chicken with mayo and kubus.

"33909899","Grill Point has become one of my Fave places when it comes to Turkish fast food places... even their crispy burgers are pretty good... 
price is reasonable for the quality and service is fairly quick and very eager to serve you...
the open kitchen in the front is a welcome sight when you walk in...
delivery comes neatly packaged and the food is reasonably fresh...
the Veg part is a little scarce but since this is a fairly new place I'm sure they will add them soon
