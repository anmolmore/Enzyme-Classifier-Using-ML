"15390331","House of Pops came as a real surprise. We wanted to have ice cream at night and to our pleasant surprise was House of Pops. We ordered a Mango (5/5) and a Pineapple (4/5). The mango popsicle was creamy and delicious. I would highly recommend ordering from House of Pops. They deliver and it comes in good packaging. Love them. Cheers!",5,"2019-05-04 23:56:28",207,400,0
