"51274571","If you are a biryani lover and want to explore different tastes of biryani than you must visit this place. Good taste you can find the the taste of ghee while eating it. You will get more quantity compared to other restaurants for that price. 4* is because the staff will get panicked during peak time.",4,"2018-10-08 09:14:30",9,11,0

This would be the last time to visit.
They served the biryani which was not cooked and worst biryani taste ever had in my life
I don't think they are deserver to serve for Hyderabadi people with this taste.
And their staff was least bothered when complaining about rice quality, after complaining 2-3times they came and it took for them 20-25 mins to realise that they served food was not good.
We just made full payment and left from there",1,"2018-08-24 00:56:39",3,48,2

"33909899","Talk about affordability with decent taste... More for a quick bite than a full meal... might look like a mess at first but the Food tells a different story... quite a variety at low costs will make you want to try a lot of items...
open late hours sooo a good back up just in case...
Recommend the Chicken Shawarma...
Ambience can use a lot of improvement...

"4532951","Edit 2: Do try the Kaddu ki kheer here. It was a delish!
Edit 1: The restaurant had invited us to a complimentary lunch, for providing a better experience. The service was better this time. They do have a shortage of staff, so getting attention of the server is a bit difficult. The food this time around was a lot better, almost all the dishes being available. The service was quick. 
One of the most disappointing food experiences ever. Around 6 of us went for lunch here today. I had heard the place is good for snacks, and they had recently expanded to a proper menu. Thinking of trying out the place, we landed here. 
First off, we asked what is available in the starters. One of the waiter kept telling No to every item we asked for. Finally, someone senior to him came, and informed us that ""in the evening, everything will be available"". Not sure what this was supposed to mean, as we were there for an afternoon lunch. 
He finally went inside, and sent a checklist of the things that could be made. We finally ordered for the following:
-Chicken Drumsticks
-Malai Tikka
-Veg Manchurian
-Butter Chicken
-Paneer Butter Masala
-Rumali rotis (because they had no other kind of roti or naan avaialable in breads)
-Chicken Dum Biryani
Waiting for our order was an extreme test of our patience. We had placed order for all this, after confirming that these would be readily available. Almost 40 minutes of waiting later, the food started arriving in the following order:
-Drumsticks
-Biryani
-Malai Tikka
-Veg Manchurian
-Butter Chicken and all the Rumali Rotis
-Paneer Butter Masala
On an average, there was a time gap of 7-10 mins between each dish. The biryani kept getting cold, and the vegetarians (including me) had to wait a long time before we could start off with anything. All the rotis had come together, but the paneer dish wasn't there, leading to the hardening of roti by the time we could eat it. The Biryani, mind you, was served without any salan or raita by the side. 
Also, the Butter Chicken was initially told to be Paneer Butter Masala. Luckily, we checked before consuming.
The non-veg biryani was good, malai tikka was dry, and all others average. 
We ordered for a Veg Biryani as well at the end. It had a foul and almost tangy taste. Somehow managed to finish the meal. But getting the bill was another tester for us. The guy slowly tapped on his tab and finally was able to generate a bill, 10 minutes of wait later. 
We spent a good 1380 only to be dissatisfied completely.",3.5,"2017-10-13 18:06:09",150,2106,6
"240187","This review is for multi cusine restaurant they opened newly.
Food quality is good but quantity doesn't.
Very less quantity of biryani, full biryani which they offer is sufficient to single person.
Too much ghee in biryani.
Service is damn slow, they took 2hrs to serve 4 biryani , we returned half stomach since the service is slow.
Restaurant owners doesn't respond to any of your concern.
No proper hygiene followed by servers/waiters.",2.5,"2017-10-13 14:33:33",43,1033,0
"36322382","this menu is froud they change more than whatever is listed in this menu so think before going (like i ordered paratha they charged me 60 each but in menu it is listed 50 and other item also more than this).

"27871627","Been twice to this place. I had their Veg Arrabiata pasta and Italian Delight Pizza. I found food here to be fresh and flavorful. Its a place to go for a quick bite and they have good fresh fruit juice selections. I wish to checkout their rolls and wraps too.",2.5,"2017-07-31 22:33:25",13,79,0

I just rate it as avg restaurant. Menu available presently are some rice items , parathas , ice creams , shawarma , juices and cocktails etc. Now they are planning to expand there restaurant on first floor of same building. I tasted shawarma and juices. Coming to shawarma it's avg taste and juices seems very natural, they prepared freshly. Coming to cost price doesn't deserve for which they are resembling.",3,"2016-12-28 00:07:20",34,41,1

"34517918","Ambience is decent.Ordered Paav Bhaaji.It was ok ok.But Quantity was too less,They did two pieces of a small Paav.And Bhaji was not fresh,even they didn't add butter over the Bhaaji. n no salad...gave chopped onions only",2.5,"2016-09-25 20:33:17",40,609,0
"257213","Have been here 3 times so far, have tried Veg. club sandwich, Chicken wrap and Cottage cheese (paneer) wrap, They give alot of attention to detail, and the food looks good and also tastes nice. Also they gave some french fries with the sandwich which was cool, and they arrange the salad in an ornate way. kitchen is open and seems pretty hygienic. Tried their mexican chicken pizza which is value for money and is flavoursome. The crust was not crunch enough, would remember to ask for a crunchy pizza next time. Overall, the paneer wrap was their best dish so far which was tasting like BBQ chicken. I'll be trying the chat and parathas next time.
Do give it a try.

"1449874","Ambience : 3.5/5 : Decent, pretty small(could be uncomfortable for more then 15 guys), Quite nice and decent color used in interior and love your open kitchen kinda concept)
Price : 4/5 : Really very feasible and worth prices of the items.
Food : 4/5 : Had tried NCube two times and found the taste amazing and really delicious. You guys are really doing good. Don't know why always I see the your place empty even though it's located in perfect place.
Advice to others : A mist visit resto for having chat, may be paratha, ice cream falooda and Arabian food as well.(since I'm vegie, so can't tell you the nveg item's review) ",4,"2016-09-04 22:58:23",43,350,0
