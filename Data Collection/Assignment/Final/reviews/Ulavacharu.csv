"1202564","WOW Ulavacharu. I NEVER ever knew your biryanis are so freakin awesome.
So I happened to go here by chance as my friend suggested we should just try this place. And my god. Me being eggatarian, obvious i ordered for an Egg Biryani. What presentation and what taste. Usually you just get the egg booked on top of the rice, but here, they cut it and the spice is inside of the cut Egg. How cool and tasty. I did have some before like this but this, this taste. Yummmmm. Kudos!
However they have done complimentary sweet for everyone the day I went there. That wasn't all that good. Way to sweet. Uhh. And my friend is a Non-vegetarian, he had some chicken Biryani and sure he licked his fingers. Awesome Ulavacharu. I'm coming back soon. Thank-you.",5,"2019-03-31 16:57:53",54,68,3

"30785857","A lot of people suggested this place for some real spicy food. Had been there twice and in fact the first time I went there I knew that whenever I have guests at home I need to bring them here. Nicely done interiors - the antique door and the idol at the entrance, very beautiful and welcoming.
Coming the food this tile we we're welcomed with some ghee Mysore pak (yummy). The staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken, fish and mutton biryani /pulao. Delicious , full of masalas and tasty. Nothing to complain about the food. Bamboo chicken was the star dish , it just melts in your mouth.
So it's a place for some really fine dining. On Fridays and weekends do make a reservation, the have some crazy waiting .
Definitely recommended.",5,"2019-03-06 03:18:46",21,17,0
"69666013","This place gives a strong Telugu vibe. Taste of the food is little spicey. I ordered Bengali Kodi and bamboo chicken in starter. It was good and in main course took ulavacharu special fried rice which is little spicey. In dessert ordered kulfi which is very less amount as compared to price.

We ordered Raju gari kodi pulao, chicken majestic and ulvacharu kodi pulao, names are self explanatory and village names which makes the taste buds high to taste.

"3010162","One of the most recommended places to enjoy authentic andhra cuisine. Been here multiple times and tried many dishes, they never let us down. As soon as we enter, we were offered with complimentary sweet - jalebi. (Sometimes they forget, in so, you can ask for it)
Among starters, bamboo chicken and bangla kodi are my favorites.
Bamboo chicken is very tender and it gets cooked inside a hollow bamboo stick and its sizzling hot with yummy taste.
Bangla kodi is very unique with each chicken piece wrapped in a sliced potato, this is a must try.
They have got a wide range of main course to cater to everyone's need, I have tried prawns vepudu pulav, this is the dish to go for if you like prawns, spicy, yummy, tasty, fulfilling and satiating.
Pachi mirchi kodi pulav and Gadwal kodi pulav are great too. Raju gari kodi pulav is their signature dish, but it will be soggy so not everybody may like it.
Don't forget to cool off your taste buds with rose milk or junnu in the end
Ambiance is soothing and sets the right atmosphere for a great meal. Service is bit slow and could be improved.
No issues with parking, they've got valet.",4,"2019-02-19 07:11:32",108,2531,2

"51671476","Ulavacharu is well known for its taste. But the service I received today was the worst and this is not the first time even after complaining to the manager about it he did not even apologize for it and moreover he delivered me mutton instead of chicken and when asked about it he was like this is chicken and he tried blaming me instead . The way they behaved was worst . Manager named veera babu was very rude too. He was not even responding whatever we ask he said I am the sole owner and no one is above me.

"39176993","Went here for dinner with my big time foodie friend Surya Tej Kanuri, he only recommended the place and I liked it. As we entered, they served complementary badusha, and it was good. Both of us being non-vegetarian we ordered fish, bamboo chicken, mutton biryani, and some regional dessert which I am not aware of (also they have limited number of desserts, and some of them were not available).

"37543093","Ulavacharu is one of the best south indian cuisine here I have tried in Hyderabad city.. Being a north indian (oppps, West Bengal is not considered as a northern state, so being an East Indian) my first step for an authentic Andhra rochulu (am I pronouncing right?) Went pretty good.. The ambience, decoration & presentation were amazing.. Food taste was amazing.. They serve 2 laddoos as complimentary when you sit on the chairs.. overall a good experience!
I exactly forgot the names of those 3 dishes we ordered but Junnu in desert was something different I never tried before.. mildly sugary desert made from fresh cowmilk (custard pie type) was amazing.",5,"2019-02-13 12:12:44",35,170,2
"30355286","Very bad experience with this place. Ordered lemon corriender soup with godavari royyala vepudu. soup is good in consistency but high on sourness. Not really good. Royyala vepudu was good but not hot, looks like they prepared an hour ago. After that we ordered gadwal Kodi pulao which is my worst experience ever. It is an highly spiced rice which a normal person can't eat.

"1988100","The place is really nice and gives a very strong telugu vibe. Nice old songs to go with courteous service. We ordered for Chicken fry pulav and sweet corn soup. Sweet corn soup was ok. The pulav was really good but really spicy which was expected. Suggestion would be to order a boneless pulav instead. Also we finished with a veg ulavacharu biryani. The veg option was disappointing. Should stick to non veg pulav/biryani and boneless. ",3,"2019-02-04 12:53:55",194,509,0

The Masam Vedupu Pulao and the Masam Miriyala are a must try here , The Andhra Kodi Kura didn’t quite live up to my expectations though . Ended the meal with the Rajahmundry Rose Milk which also ticked the box .Service was fantastic throughout.Overall enjoyed my experience here and would recommend this place to people looking for spicy authentic Andhra  food .

"50506211","I got to visit this place through a giveaway by @hyderabadfooddiaries and it was worth a visit. We tried the bamboo chicken which is an iconic telugu appetizer that has soft tender chicken cooked with right amount of spices. Mamsam vepudu which was the star of the show with spicy, perfectly cooked mutton that justified it being telugu cuisine. The Rajugari Kodi Pulao was the best of all.
This pulao had a different taste and texture, unlike biryani, this dish is similar to a porridge with soft chicken and delicious curry. This place has huge variety of appetizers, curries and rice in chicken, mutton,seafood and veg options.
Best destination for spice lovers👍

"44732858","Been to this place with my friends today, Let me start with the good part first, ordered ""Bamboo chicken"" as part of starter which tasted awesome but the quantity is little compared to the price they charge. 
As part of main course we ordered ""Rayala vari kodi pulao"" which tasted good but again the quantity is very less compared to the pricing and also the portion of chicken served is little in quantity, next comes the dish which was hyped ""Raju gari kodi pulao"", they took almost 25 mins to get it served on the table, we were waiting on the table after finishing the starters and first part of main course for this dish to be served, we were kind of disappointed as the dish did not taste good.
In short good place but pricing is bit high, value for money 3 out of 5.

We ordered junnu for desert which was the only good thing amongst all the dishes bit the quantity was so less for the price.

"46865782","Too much hyped....!!!
Heard a lot about this restaurant, but finally it ended up with a disappointment, mainly the pulav's.
Initially we were offered complementary sweets.Tried Pachi Mirchi Kodi pulav,Oorugallu Veg Pulav,Kotha Kodi & Crunchy curd cutlet.
Pachi Mirchi Pulav - was nice but lacked the expected spiciness,though its a medium varient.
Oorugallu Veg Pupav- Mostly tasted like normal rice but the spice mix was quite authentic, tasted like baby onions coocked with mango pickle.Quite a different experience, never had one like this before.
Kotha Kodi- Just an edited version of Chicken Majestic.
Crunchy curd cutlet - Good but too oily.
Finally ended the meal with a dessert(Junnu), which was good of all the items i had in the restaurant.
Good thing about the restraunt is it had a decent ambience and can accommodate quick a good number.Service was generous but a bit slow.

We ordered Bamboo Chicken and Pachi Mirchi Kodi Pulao. Both the dishes had fresh ingredients.
Bamboo chicken has good flavors but was more than mildly spicy. It is served directly from the bamboo box it is cooked in. It also has dry gravy so it's not entirely a good choice for starters, will go well with any Indian bread.
Pachi Mirchi kodi pulao was awesome. The rice was flavorful. Chicken curry served over it was semi - gravy and yummy as well. The chicken was nicely complementing the rice.
Service can be improved a bit. Will go again to this place to try other dishes. ",4,"2018-11-18 00:01:36",77,323,4

I have to heat and boil it again to take water out and it became paste. Is this how you serve customers? Pathetic. I am never going to order again from this restaurant.

Ambiance was kind of historic type with all wooden sculpture kind. It was nice .
We have tried pandumirchisticks which is my fav till date.
Coming to ragi sankati , it has disappointed me a bit. I expected it to be more tasty but it was not bad.
Over all you can enjoy there with yummy food. ",3,"2018-10-18 13:04:52",30,68,5

Rotis are very hard and Ulavacharu biryani is too much masala and no tasty.

"31929629","India is a food nation, every 50 kms you travel from one point to another the taste,spices and the approach changes. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is no different. Andhra the way they cook their dishes is more earthy and less spicy compared to Telangana cuisine. Rayalseema being all healthy as they use Raagi, Spices are very earthy. Why am I preaching this because all these varieties are to be found in Ulavacharu.
Ulavacharu is a vibrant Telugu Brand having branches throughout Hyderbad. Banjarahills, Gachibowli etc....
Their Unique Dishes names, taste especially their crispy chicken skin, although a little tweeek is much needed to the palatte of Hyd. So overall the setup is amazing it just doesn't serve food it gives you an experience. A Must visit place. Points to consider for restaurant their Rose milk is a bad imitation of Rajamundry ,they serve fruitpunch naming it as Rajamundry.. so as I said tweeks are much needed.
4/5 is my rating",4,"2018-10-05 08:56:36",128,5520,42

"34009097","So, when I went with my parents, I observed the restaurant was jam-packed with people (I swear, it was difficult to get to our seats also). In a way, I couldn't appreciate the ambiance much. We ordered Ulavacharu Vegetable Pulao and what I believe was Pandu Mirapakaya (I hope I'm right). The food was tasty, well-made, with a slightly different mix of spices from the usual. I enjoyed the rice and the flavor it had. Having never tried any rice item of that sort, it felt like a novel burst of flavors to my restless buds. I'd recommend trying the food here at least once. ",4,"2018-10-01 15:56:39",122,636,1
