"3201367","Have been a huge fan of this chain since 2013. Have been to the restaurant in different cities, and have noticed some significant differences across all locations.
This Gachibowli BBQ Nation has some items missing from its live counter, but have curd rice which wasn’t available in any other location I have been to.
The staff is extremely courteous. We were served by Rajib, who was really warm, quick in his service.
The overall quality of the food was satisfying, just like most of the other outlets I’ve been to.",4,"2019-05-05 17:13:13",67,185,4
"40319532","As usual it's fab place to have grill in a buffet. Non veg is awesome here. Chicken, Mutton, Prawns, Fish are served on the grill. Some days you also get crab curry. Now they opened tawa starters as well.
Nice place to go for team lunch/dinner.",5,"2019-05-04 13:58:30",231,406,7
"53439650","Food quality is good. But not so many items, like crabs, octopus, kofta are available , particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of BN or ABs. So, it was really disappointing. 
Also service was a bit slow, we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between. That really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good. I think the number of waiters are less.
AC facility was good, very cold. 
But I don’t recommend this place.",2,"2019-05-03 15:36:51",24,13,0
"37794020","This is an amazing place for Veg as well as Non Veg starters. There are so many varieties in it. As you will be already full, you don't generally go for Main course and also it's very average. I really love their service. Suppose you don't like item, they will replace it by customising according to your requirement. ",5,"2019-04-27 22:12:07",18,18,1

It's was sudden plan from Gang to visit this place, fortunately that day was 10 years celebrations day of BN.
We got some discount on bill also. We all from coastal area basically and sea food lovers.
Believe me or not, I loved and felt happy wit prawns here...yummy and yummy.
It might silly...we did justice to my money, may more also.

"35183130","I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.
The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.
Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.
The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.
The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.
I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.
Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together. ",3,"2019-03-29 17:36:44",24,41,0

"15988980","We went to this place as a part of corporate outing. It was my first time to Barbeque Nation. I must admit that I was pretty much humbled by the chef coming over very often and asking if the food was up to our satisfaction. The starters alone were enough to fill up my belly. When it came to having the main course, the options were not many but it suffficed, I would say. The waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies. ",4,"2019-03-03 17:54:48",4,1,0
"2749154","Barbeque is mostly my favorite but if I compare barbeque nation with Abs , sahib's barbeque... obviously I have to give one point less to this one...food is good but limited items..but if you have kid go there my son and my friend's kids enjoyed a lot there they were given car and balloon by staff and lots of fruits and french fries...they enjoyed to the core... ambience is gud service excellent...

"2742200","Friday afternoon, We planned team lunch (veg & non-veg) in Gachibowli Barbecue Nation. We were asked several times to give excellent rating by various attendants which was quiet annoying while we were having lunch even though food & variety served was average and wasn't upto standard w.r.t taste & variety.
In short, it wasn't value for money. 
I think it would be better to choose Absolute Barbecue over Barbecue Nation, as customer you get value for money. Seems like now Barbecue Nation is just riding on its legacy.",3,"2019-02-08 16:53:46",1,38,0

Barbeque Nation have been always my favorite when it comes to barbeque and their amazing mocktails and juices as they keep innovating the menu and the deserts. Has a lag in my order when I had been there last time but I guess it may be because of the high intensity of people who come and dine. A very good place with very welcoming staff.",4,"2019-01-13 10:54:14",59,197,0

"1184176","Early Christmas celebrations. we were dressed up and wanted fine dine. We were told that Barbeque Nation is always booked, we tried our luck anyway and got a table for 9:30.
From the greeting to serving and the host was so nice...I must give them 5 stars for excellent customer service.
The Starters were amazing....I love prawns but it's kinda tricky to get perfect and well seasoned 
But their Prawns are the best grilled prawns I ever tasted. They could have done a little better job for tandoori chicken but it was fine ..... the starters were so yumm that we didn't want to try the main course.... My personal favs were Grilled Prawns and RoseMary Chicken...mmm..  mmm... mmmmm yummy !!!! 
Thank you so much for your excellent service and Great Food..Hope to visit you guys soon..!!!",4,"2018-12-26 08:32:15",87,137,0

Ambiance : good enough
Service : the staff were all very polite but a bit slow
The taste of food was very good. They had chicken tandoori, mutton kebab, veg kebab, American corn, creamy crispy potato as starters apart from the grilled stuff. On the grill they served one variety each of chicken, basa fish, prawn, mushroom, paneer, pineapple. The main course did not have much variety but honestly no one had enough space for it. The dessert options were sorted and tasty. They had 2 ice cream flavours, Gulab jamun, kheer, brownie, milk cakes, pastries and tarts, 2 kulfi. Over all the experience was very good. 
Would want to visit again😊",4,"2018-12-17 22:23:18",118,770,2

"40153391","We were here to give our treat to a group of friends. What started out with cold barbeque, bad grills turned out to worst. The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute. Btw, this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad. ",1,"2018-11-29 01:50:04",22,17,0

"15102371","Have visited this place on 2nd October with my family to celebrate my sister's birthday. All the places were booked but luckily got seats in late hour for lunch. Place is not that huge but very well maintained, hospitality is top notch by their staff.
Coming to food, starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table. Chicken, prawns, mushroom, paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely. It was really amazing in taste. Potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow. There was no dish which didnt disappoint.
Main course - This is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations. All the dishes were really good in taste, usually I skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here I have tried and it was really good. Egg curry, chicken, mutton Rogan all were good. Biryani was also good. Noodles with sauce were delicious enough. It wasn't their just to keep up the numbers.
Dessert - My favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth. Pastries, please cake, kheer, brownie all were good. Kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top.
Overall we had a ball at this place, from starter to main course and dessert all were really good. They didn't give us any point where anything can be deducted. Service was top notch as usual and value for money. This outlet is one the best on in Hyderabad hands down.",5,"2018-10-31 01:37:44",362,4096,6

"46188945","To start with , the complimentary drinks Blue mojito , pacific blue , fresh lime soda were refreshing. The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken , prawns or fish. Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day. The veg starters - Mushroom is a immediate No , cripsy corn was not salted properly , paneer came as a saviour.  Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer. Coming to Desserts : Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled. Browine was too dry , cakes were not tasty, apple/pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup , phirni an absolute no , kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it. Overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section.

"58128725","I almost forgot to write the review as I got too busy until I found these pictures in my gallery. I was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month. What a bad day it was. When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That’s what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense. At the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).
Not just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. The team was all the time waiting for them to get the food. The overall experience was bad, something not expected from a BBQ Nation.",2,"2018-10-09 21:06:14",10,2,2

Now, let me tell you about my experience at this outlet, not going to judge the other outlets. The service was not good, we had to call em' more than thrice to get the starters served, the chicken tasted stale, fish and prawns were amazing though. They were serving complimentary drinks, I selected ice tea, worst one I've ever had.
The good thing about this place, their ""manager,"" he knew we weren't happy, tried his best to make things right for us, made the chef come to our table, which felt good and cared for.

Ambiance-
Barbeque Nation is located near Wipro Lake exactly beside Deli 9 Bistro. This outlet of Barbeque Nation is quite congested. As it is situated at the Ground floor, indoor sitting includes well maintained sitting arrangement with large tables of capacity upto 8-10 people per table. They play silent English songs in the background.
Food-
As we have arrived before 7pm, we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails. They served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque. As we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. In the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. We had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. After that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. We requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. In main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, Chinese and biryani. Finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis, ice creams, Gulab Jamun, pastries, firni and brownies.
Service-
Service was very quick and the staff was very good. Chef himself came to our table to take the feedback.",4,"2018-07-31 23:27:18",101,332,0

It's like they have put the same spices on Fish .. chicken , mushroom and prawns..  Deserts are simply the worst.... It's like just name sake they are serving ... 
For those who want to taste something good.. it's not recommended. ",1,"2018-07-21 19:19:43",1,0,0

Starters and dessert always amazing.
Main course have a lot of varities but we always fill ourselves with starters that no place is left in stomach to try main course.
Overall it has been one of my favourite place .",5,"2018-07-20 14:48:36",88,187,0

"888021","Excellent service and food buffet! This place has really warm service and they are always willing to customise the menu since it becomes repetitive otherwise. The pocket pinch is slightly higher, but it's totally worth it. 
Then best starters are Cajun potato, crispy corn, mushrooms, dahi kebabs, corn tikki. All the starters are lip-smacking. Make sure to keep room for the main course. 
I haven't tried many options from the main course, though, dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice. 
Coming to desserts, gal Jamuns are literally out of the world. Try them with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. You wouldn't want to eat them anywhere else! Alongside, pan kulfi is a must try. 😍😬 there are a plenty of other desserts to choose from. 
Always up for a BarBQue grill 🍖",5,"2018-07-06 20:52:20",86,215,1
"39981132","Visited it along with my friend for dinner buffet last week. 
Most of the starters were served slowly. Even after repetitive reminding no response from the staff. Fish starters were not well cooked. Chicken starters & crispy corn were good.
Mains and desserts were good as usual, not much different from others.",3,"2018-07-05 16:17:50",9,19,0
"718278","More expensive than the other barbecue counterparts but once you experience this place, you will realise why it's worth every penny. From the starters to the main course. Everything was rich in flavour and taste. Softest mutton sheekh kebab ever I tasted here. The menu didn't include mutton keema, yet our waiter Gopal served us some with pav and ghee naan. His hospitality is worth mentioning. The head chef came and took our feedback. Very warm ambience, good people and great food. Don't miss this place. ",5,"2018-07-03 16:46:57",6,45,0

"44725617","It’s a hell of party when you land with your colleagues or friends at barbecue nation. I should not say about the tenderness of grilled fish, chicken and mutton kebabs being served as starters but also about the veg dishes that grabbed my attention. The main course meals were really nice and dessert was also pretty good for the meal package. It’s a must option if you are choosing for corporate meals, birthday celebrations or friends hangout.

"8169781","We went here from office. A group of 17 members. We were the first so seating was not an issue. I had veg starters and it was marvellous. For once the spice levels matched my lower than normal Hyderabad spice margins. The paneers were too soft for the skewers and kept dropping into the fire. The corn fried were very good. Food was excellent especially the sweet corn soup. Desserts we very good. On the whole a satisfying experience.",4,"2018-06-26 19:51:12",61,1188,0

"46124734","Quick review points
- slippery floor .. be careful when you good with high heels or children. Perhaps they don't have time to clean it up to reach standards of safe place
- bathrooms meant for rotten rats... Dirty washroom and tiny doors. Hefties and jumbo sizes, you can't get in
- service ... Ohhh they can't handle crowd from 8 pm till the place starts getting filled up. For sure you will get feel of crowded market where waiters shout and chatter, but service time and order time is pathetic.
- advance bookings ... They don't understand what means advance booking as soon as u step in
- pan kulfi... It should rather be named as sugar syrup topped with milk and green color. Pathetic and not worth giving tough time to your taste buds.",2.5,"2018-06-23 14:54:26",2,3,0

I liked the way staff took my concern regarding pastry where I felt contained an egg (I am vegetarian). They not only ensured me that the said pastry is egg less but also offered me special chocolate chips icecream. You guys are just too good in the hospitality.

"50041366","I have visited barbeque nation multiple times and it has been beyond my expectations every time. I love the items which they keep on their grills especially the non-vegetarian ones. in the non-veg ones I most like their prawns and the fish. I had forgot to mention the service and the ambience. the service is good and even the ambience is great. in of the grill I like the crispy corn and  the and some aloo thing they serve it is always awesome. as we went there on jewel of the sea festival, I had got crab curry (with no flesh in it) and we had butter naan and tandoori roti. crab curry was not so great but nice. the butter naan was great and even the tandoori roti was nice. we even went for curd rice and dal makhni. both of them were nice. my overall experience with barbeque nation was awesome.",4,"2018-05-14 09:19:14",22,52,0

"52186139","Last minute decision,absolutely worth it. Mouth watering starters- ranging from mutton kebab,grilled prawn,chicken,fish,chicken,pineapple, cheesy potato,crispy corn and deep fried squid(which was to my surprise really good) coupled with chilled SCRUMPTIOUS mocktail. Not much of ""Main-Course"" guy so skipped to dessert section. Desserts were on little disappointing side though i liked gulab-jamun and kulfi(must try). Phirni and brownie(DBC) were OK. Rest were Meh. Service was astonishingly inconvenient initially but improved greatly over the time. Planning to visit again.
