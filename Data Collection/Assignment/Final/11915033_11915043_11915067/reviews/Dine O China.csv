"54532340","Its a nice place, good food and good ambience.
Ambience - ambience is good and contemporary.
Staff - staff is efficient, humble and very thoughtful. Ordered veg machurian but the manchurian balls were pretty hard. We expressed our concern to the staff. Staff, being very thoughtful, immediately replaced veg manchurian with the better version.
Food - You get authentic Chinese cuisines. Ordered veg dimsums/ momos, burnt garlic fried rice and veg manchurian with gravy. Everything turned out to be very tasty. ",5,"2019-04-04 00:00:01",22,12,5
"34774600","I went to this place for lunch with my mom and dad. The ambience is quite decent, with a lot of seating places. We ordered chicken coriander soup, golden fried prawns, a mixed fried rice and a plate of dry chilly chicken. Golden fried prawns were a bit plain, it could have been more flavourful. The soup was good. Fried rice and chily chicken were good in taste. All costed us around Rs. 1400. It was a light and good meal. I'd like to revisit this place again.",4,"2019-03-05 23:57:57",22,161,2

Chilly chicken was so bland, Crispy honey chicken was not at all crispy. We had to ask them to re do it. Somehow they have not maintained thr quality nor taste.",2,"2019-02-20 16:56:39",35,959,0

"36253920","I went there yesterday night with my friends around 10pm. They welcomed us by saying the starters won't be available, so we should rather start with the main course. Ordered veg schezwan rice, and pan fried noodles.,the food was decent. The funny part was as soon as the food arrived, they requested us to pay the bill. The food was okayish but we are thankful they didn't kick us out while we were eating.
In short, horrible service. ",2,"2019-02-09 11:47:07",7,3,0

"757333","Ohh finally the wait is over, I have been seeing this restaurant from quite sometime and finally I am at Dine O China. From outside it looks good. I got flat 50% offer from Dine out ""that's exciting""..
First thing to try was Chicken Tom Yum soup.. ohh it was one good tasting soup I had for a while. And then from nowhere we ordered butter garlic prawn.. it surprised me as well.. never seen this in a Chinese restaurant and to no surprise it was HORRIBLE.. battered fried butter garlic prawn with no hint of butter anywhere.. with my experience I would call it a piece of &#-+.. it was all crapy.. and when I asked I got the reply that the Chinese chef has changed... And they replaced the item with chilly garlic prawn.. it was ok for my liking..
Now we have orderedChicken drumsticks
Shezwan chicken dimsums
Singapore noodles mix
Chinese chopsuey
Yang Chow Rice
Schezwan Chicken
To sum up the best item was chicken drumsticks.¬†
Dimsums where stale and the outer coating was all soggy.
Singapore noodles was more vermicelli than noodles.
Yan chow rice was good
So was Schezwan chicken.
Experience was decent I would say specially with the offer I got.. flat 50% off.
A loud shout out to the dine out team ..
I would wish to come again if I get such offer .. but a friendly suggestion to the restaurant.. please try and make some change as we have very less Chinese restaurant nearby..¬†
Thanks",3,"2019-02-05 23:55:56",6,30,0

"36424861","It was a date with my girls who wanted to eat Chinese so we decided to go to Dine O China for the simple reason that it is close to home and it turned out that we chose a super place to have Chinese.
The restaurant is located in Gachibowli and is easy to drive to from ORR and has a proper basement parking so no issues even on the busy Gachibowli road; for me it is a major point of concern if I am driving on my own so at least parking was sorted.
We entered the restaurant and were warmly welcomed by a stewardess who took down our order and served us. It felt like by the women for the women. It felt comfortable that is all.
The seating arrangement is quite comfortable and I particularly liked the chairs as they were so comfortable. We ordered chicken drumsticks and honey chilli potato for starters and both the dishes were awesome. Kids liked the chicken drumsticks and finished the plate. They were juicy and done to perfection and my girls told me that they were fresh also. Honey chilli potato was crunchy and sweet and chilly just like it should be.
For our main course we ordered veg dimsums and chicken dimsums and mix Chinese chopsuey. Both the dimsums were tasty and the wrapping was quite thin so you could taste the filling which was quite substantial. But I would recommend that you have dimsums with the sauce that they serve with honey chilly potato. I find it tastes better with this chilly sauce rather than the sauce that they serve with dimsums.
The mix Chinese chopsuey has a mix of egg, chicken and seafood and the girls told me that they liked the taste of it.
For dessert we tried chocolate fried ice cream which can be given a pass as I didn't like it that much.
Infact we liked the food so much that we got chilli garlic noodles packed for dinner also. And also the girls could not finish the chopsuey so we got it packed and will now have it in dinner.
We liked the place very much and once the husband gets back to Hyderabad we are visiting this place again for sure.
Pity Zomato doesn't give me chance to review the place on my second visit. Like I mentioned we would come back to this place we went there yesterday afternoon for some snacks and got some dinner packed for ourselves. We tried chilli garlic fish, kids' favourite chicken drumsticks again, chicken satay and lemon chicken coriander soup and veg talumein soup. All of which was great.
We asked for crispy chilly baby corn which turned out to be too salty and on complaining the stewardess served us a fresh batch which was quite tasty.
Definitely a must visit place. Will be back again when I am craving for some yummy Chinese food.coinsandmaps.com",4,"2018-11-21 20:04:11",7,20,12

"2746120","One of the best Chinese restaurants in Gachibowli -Hitech city area. Chilli paneer and chicken manchurian are great choices for starters. The momos are also good , huge and filling. The chilli garlic fried rice was flavourful but the Singapore noodles was just okish. We ended with fried ice cream and were totally satisfied by our choice. 
Service is a little slow, this can be improved. ",4,"2018-06-23 19:35:11",62,189,0

May be I should have tried thupka or some other northeast specialities.
Give it a try once and do not order corn soup as it has more Aararote powder mixed ",3,"2018-06-18 16:30:30",15,5,0
