"47677585","I ordered 2 shawarmas, one was averaged sized. The other was a miniature. There is inconsistency in size, the taste is not worthy of a praise. The some chunks of chicken felt raw while chewing, they were delivered cold. Please save your money and time, there are definitely significantly better places to eat shawarmas from.",1,"2019-05-12 00:05:11",11,5,0
"69803645","Not knowing about the shawarma spots in the locality of gachibowli. Out of cravings, ordered rumali special shawarma and surprisingly the shawarma was #fabulous, although the ratings were average. The food amazed me completely. The chicken was very juicy also crisp (a different kind of shawarma). The amount of chicken loaded inside was really good. I suggest to go or order from this place and have a taste of it.

"90095082","The good part about them is that they are very competitive in pricing. But the taste can be much better. If you compare it with the shawarmas available in DLF area, this doesn't stand good. ",3,"2019-01-18 14:17:30",11,8,0

"1903288","Definitely not worth your money and time. There are multiple places which serve better shawarmas for the same price. Agreed that this place is for the price conscious but you can definitely have better shawarmas with more fillings at this rate.Â 
The fillings were overpowered with too much quantity of sauces which underpowered the taste of the chicken.Â

Ordered special Rumali chicken shawarma.
1. It is bit pricey when compared to other shawarma ( Each 140 RS)
2. Shawarma size is smaller than other places.
3. Spicy and you can try to have a good shawarma.
Overall the taste is Soo good and spicy.",4,"2018-08-09 23:14:35",17,42,1
