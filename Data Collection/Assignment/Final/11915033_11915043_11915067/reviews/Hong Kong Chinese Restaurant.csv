"53439650","I have been a regular visitor in this restaurant. I particularly like the gravy noodles(Chinese chowmein). Also, it‚Äôs not a crowded place like other restaurants. You will enjoy the place if you want to have a quite meal. The food quality is also very good. It won‚Äôt disappoint you. 
Once we had Black Beans chicken, it had a flavour that taste like fermented soya bean(you will understand if you were from Northeast part of India). Basically, our body gets heated up after we consumed the dish. 
It was a different kind. 
The owner is also Chinese.
Fast service  
Problem: They accept only cash!!

If you happen to be here go for their manchow soup, chilli paneer, kung pao chicken and chilli chicken.
Decently priced restaurant with courteous staff.
Please remember to carry cash as they do not accept any other form of payments.",4,"2019-02-18 05:53:26",9,2,2

"40382729","It‚Äôs not the first time me and my friends have been to this restaurant. Today we went to Hongkong restaurant for lunch. Earlier we were four and later one of our friend joined us so we wanted a bigger table. We shifted to other table. The lady incharge reacted as if we have done a crime by shifting table. 
2. The restaurant neither has swiping machine nor PAYTM. Like , these days Paytm every one has it. Very strange that means if you want to go to Hongkong restaurant Gachibowli , please note Gachibowli you have to have cash or else you cannot have food in that restaurant. I am surprised.
3. When my friend checked can we pay by card she started making faces. We thought ok let it be we will some how manage and we started paying in cash . she asks us a question can‚Äôt you all pay in one go. My friend said that we all have  different bills and we will pay individually. 
4. Last but not the least when asked for mouth refreshments she behaved or she answered back as if we have asked her something complimentary. 
5. Way of talking is pathetic. We are not expecting her to be like a 5 star hotel restaurant but basics has to be followed . when you run a restaurant and don‚Äôt forget that you are into hospitality business where in guests feedback matters a lot. The entire experience was very bitter, neither the food nor the restaurant services offered at HONG KING RESTAURANT was worth spending so much money. 
Me and my friends for sure will not come again to HONG KONG GACHIBOWLI. ",1,"2018-10-31 16:07:12",2,4,0

I visited this place during lunch time, I came to know about this place through word of mouth. 
We have ordered ‚Äúkung pao chicken‚Äù, ‚ÄúPepper chicken‚Äù and ‚ÄúSingapore noodle chicken‚Äù.

"1366361","Dropped by here for lunch as I had got many good feedback about the food here .
The place is very simple , no extravagant stuffs, feels like you are sitting at the dining table of someone's home.
It's also run by a family I guess.
Started with ordering a manchow soup , which was very good,strong flavors of pepper which was a huge relief for my sore throat.
Moved on to order a chilly chicken dry and a mix noodles.
Chilly Chicken - Dry , lots of oil and not that good. Quantity is sufficient for two
Mix noodles - Tasted good but the prawns used were totally dried . Again the portion size is very generous.
Overall, not that satisfactory a visit.
Note - They don't accept cards or any form of e-payment.

Horrible experience with Zomato Delivery 'Valet' who showed up but did not pick up the order and did not bother to inform. The owner, Kevin, himself offered to deliver the order to my place. A gesture as big as the quantity which this restaurant serves for a price that is a bargain. Compromise on quality a bit but order for the sheer economies of scale.

Than ordered garlic egg noodles and kung pao chicken. Noodle was too much for two people. King pao chicken was little sweet. But the taste of both the things are really good. Quantity is too much for the price they are asking. 
Only thing the service needs to improve. Though it was fast but the person need to serve the food in our plate.

If you need to enjoy food always enter with a open mind and don't compare food, it's like different mothers cooking the same food with their own magic and the taste will be heavenly for all children. Always remember as GOD is to the devotee, the same way food is to the chef, they always prepare food with lots of love and care and at the end they need to see the smile of satisfaction on the customers face.

"1296747","Ordered from here through swiggy. The delivery was on time. The order was for veg kung pao and garlic fried rice. The first thing which caught my eye after opening the packs was the colour of the dish. I'm not sure if that is all food grade colour or not, so I'll leave it to that. The rice did not have any salt, it was like they forgot to put it in :D . The kung pao dish was a dry appetiser with some sauce. It didn't taste anything like a kung pao dish, but it had its own sweet flavour. The portions were huge for that price.  Will I get food from here again - maybe not.

We ordered veg singapore noodles, chicken schewan noodles and chicken manchurian.. 
Veg singapore noodles was bland and did not taste good.. Even the presentation was disgusting..
Chicken schewan noodles was not having any schewan pepper flavour, just felt like stir fried noodles.. 
Chicken manchurian was okies(add a little tomato sauce and its good to go) and had a good quantity of chicken pieces..
Service was average and i think only one person was serving everyone.. But he was trying his best..

"5825111","Giving a one-star rating is something i seldom do, mostly because it can really hurt the reputation of a restaurant. But if a restaurant is least bothered, then you definitively deserve a 1-star perhaps, something even in negative! 
This place is a favourite haunt of many of my friends and not once did we suspect that the cooking conditions might be so deplorable. Their food isn't that bad, but that definitely compensate for the insect as well as the hair that was in my food. 
We ordered for chicken noodles and American Chopsuey. Ravenous, we almost chowed down the food when I saw a bug staring back at me from the Chopsuey. It killed my appetite instantly. It was horrible. 
We sent it back. The owner, who was sitting lazily near the counter didn't even raise his eyes. He just beckoned the server and told him to replace our dish. 
We got our replacement but even then I was still seething due to the owner's apathy. As luck would have it, this particular plate had hair! A lock of hair!
Appetite demolished in one go! 
We decided to just pay and leave. What's even more concerning is that the owner didn't even twitch. He did not apologise and nor did he ask us not to pay for those dishes. Least bothered is perhaps an understatement.

It‚Äôs owned and run by a 5th generation Chinese-Indian, so it‚Äôs the most authentic Hakka Chinese you can get in Hyderabad (if not all of India). His name is Kevin, he‚Äôs very friendly and always fun to talk with. The guy is very well traveled himself and has a lot of interesting stories and knowledge to share.
In Hyderabad, it's is one of the few places where every friend and batchmate I‚Äôve taken is happy with the taste. Portion sizes are generous and the service is top notch. For example, when we do soup one-by-two or two-by-three, Kevin fills each bowl up to almost the same level as a full portion.¬†

"10803591","On the 31st night, when my friend and I were planning to stay out he took me over to Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant. The place is clean and small. I hear that the place is usually crowded but that night it was quiet and just what we wanted. We ordered veg momo , Kung pao veg and Singapore vegetarian noodles . The food was presented in decent amount of time. The momos were appropriately steamed and kung pao veg turned out to be one of the best Chinese starters I have had till date. I thoroughly enjoyed eating the food there and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. I would love to visit the place one day again. ",4,"2016-01-02 14:45:42",39,91,0

I was surprised that I did not manage to review this place even after numerous visits. This probably is my most liked place in Hyderabad for Kolkata style Chinese food.
The decor and settings are minimal gives a very close to Tyangra look. Wooden furniture, Chinese artifacts, people from the region everything works out well.
The menu has pretty good options.My personal favourites are the Chilly Chicken dry, Gravy Chow Mein, Pepper fish, Cashew Nut chicken, etc. The quantity they serve is huge compared to the pricing. Each portion is sufficient for 2 people.
The service needs to be worked upon as the wait staffs are little hesitant to serve you and also they don't understand the language (english or hindi) properly. You need to at times repeatedly ask them to refill water in your glasses. A little bit of training might sort it out.
Overall, total VFM when your pocket is tight and you still don't want to compromise your taste buds.

"2013038","It was a bit late and by the time we (party of 4) reached, the restaurant had the 'closed' sign on the door. However, when we inquired inside about the possibility of getting some food as take-away, the lady was ready. Then I requested her to accommodate us for dine-in as the take-away food would get cold by the time we reach our place, and she kindly agreed after some persuasion.
For starters, we ordered chilly potatoes which were a bit more oily to our liking, but the taste was good. Gobhi manchurian was fine and served hot. The highlight of the evening was Fish pakora which was really good. For main course, we ordered plain prawn hakka noodles and chilly garlic hakka noodles, both of which were fine.
The service was quick (we were the only ones there), and the waiters were courteous. Even the owner gentleman was concerned and took an instant feedback over the food. I would definitely try to revisit some time soon, and this time at a reasonable hour. Thanks to the owners for accommodating us, because we actually didn't have any other place to go at the time.

"1898976","Our Order included 
Veg Manchow Soup
Chilli Babycorn
Veg Chilli Garlic Noodles
Chicken Schezwan Noodles
Crispy Veg in Hot Garlic Sauce
Manchow soup was decent, quantity was pretty good. Chilli Babycorn was just average with too much cornflour coating. Then came (Noodles & Vegetables) the disaster. Noodles were excessive in oil. Every time we eat we used to feel like we are drinking oil. We informed them and they were like ""Ok Fine"" types. Veg Chilli Garlic had no garlic flavour in it, just felt they had added some masala. Chicken Schezwan Noodles had no spice or schezwan sauce added to it, just a mere red color to the noodles. Chicken quantity was extremely less, just few strips. Road side noodles with minor customization tastes much better. Crispy veg in hot garlic sauce was like uncooked cabbage pakoda in some white watery sauce. 
Service was just average. A typical family run restaurant with a cute kid throwing things around making noise.

"1899824","Last evening, wifey was craving for Chinese food and I was in no mood to travel very long. Found ""Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant"" close to my home while fidgeting over the phone. No second thought and headed straight to the place.
Upon reaching, found few of the tables were pre-occupied by some of the customers and with out delay we also got ours. The order taker took no time to reach us and taken the order immediately. We ordered, ""Veg Manchow Soup"" & ""Fried Pepper Paneer"" for starter and in a small time gap, ""Mushroom with Sweet Chilly Sauce"" & ""Veg Manchurian Noodle"" for the main course. Although the order taker later, (while we were waiting for the main course) came to us with an apologetic gesture (not conveyed verbally though) and requested to take ""Veg Szechuan Noodle"" which they prepared wrongly instead of preparing the ""Veg Machurian Noodle"" that we ordered. Lack of professionalism but ours was also a ""Chalta Hai"" attitude. My wife did not mind as long as it was a veg dish. Yet, I must applaud them for their quick service here. None of the item took much of a time (if fact less than the ideal time, usually taken by other eateries) to get served and got served pretty hot.
Soup was thick and very tasteful. The fried Pepper Paneer was superb too but served with out any complimentary sauce. We had to ask them separately to serve some tomato sauce. Although our occupied table had a tiny container of Szechuan sauce on top of it, yet wasn't really that good to taste. Little disappointment on finding a substandard Szechuan sauce, that to in a Chinese eatery. ............. Now, moving ahead for the main course, the noodles were good too but the mushroom with sweet chilly sauce was just a li'l abv average dish. Overall, tasteful dishes, if not amazing, weren't poor either. Quantity of any dish in each plate were ample to suffice to adult stomach. 
*Suggestion: Better to ask for a one by two soup, as the half soup itself is almost a full bowl.
Ambiance:
- A very tiny place which hardly could accommodate not more than 20-25 pax. 5-6 nos of table are placed, clumsy and suffocated.
- The decorative wall and roof hangings look good but remain unnoticed coz of the poor lighting.
Service:
- Although very fast but not professionally administered. Perhaps the main reason could be the staffs including the order taker and cook are family members and run the establishment together.
- Not proactive but act when asked, e.g, for water even you have to seek their attention.
At last, I dont know whether it is a regular exercise or an unfortunate one day's instance only but the owner's small kid was roaming around from one table to another inside the eatery, shouting and throwing a plastic stuff (toy perhaps) one place to another.¬† This created and unprofessional environment, did not qualify for a pleasant dinning.
My rating over all 3.5/5

"935968","Though I have passed through this road almost a million times but never noticed Hong Kong Kitchen in the corridor stretch of gachibowli to Kondapur. After repetitive search for lunch options, Zomato threw up this listing and that was the plan for a Friday lunch. 
Hong Kong kitchen is small family owned restaurant located opposite to Ramky Towers. For a Friday lunch, this place was already 100% occupied. Ordered for Hong Kong Special Soup which was thick soup with loads of vegetables thrown in, this was absolutely tasteless because of very less salt, after adding a bit of vinegar this tasted better. The Chilli Potato ordered took ages for it to be served inspite of reminding the waiter couple of times. This was nothing extraordinary, but basically French fries garnished in chilli flakes. Would have liked it even more had the fries been a little crispy than soggy. My all-time favorite Chinese chopsuey was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. 
Do not expect over the top service from staff or don‚Äôt be surprised when the staff starts playing with the Owner‚Äôs kid and running around the restaurant tossing the plastic ball which might actually hit you couple of times and yet the owner just gives you an unpretentious smile.jetseteat.com",3,"2015-02-14 11:30:25",359,4771,4
