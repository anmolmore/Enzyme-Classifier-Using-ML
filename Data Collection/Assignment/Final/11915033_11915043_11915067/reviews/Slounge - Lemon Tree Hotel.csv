"9016731","Please visit if you‚Äôve whole evening to do nothing. Here you get to play snooker (for free) if you‚Äôre a guest,which I was. The place is not crowded at all so you have the table at your disposal for entire evening. You get chips with beers and beer is not expensive. I didn‚Äôt eat anything else. Good experience overall.

We've had few drinks at the counter and the bartender Vilas was so good at explaining the different cocktails and was very good at choosing the best one we needed. Cheers man. Pool table is an added benefit. We actually enjoyed playing the game. So, overall this is a good choice to hangout. Good example of Class!! Wish to be here again.",5,"2018-11-07 22:52:07",3,2,0

"959890","Have stayed in Lemon Tree quiet a lot of times and have found Slounge to be nice option to eat something light and have a few drinks even if you are alone. Visited the place a few weeks back with a colleague of mine and had a wonderful time talking.¬†
After a long time I tried wine and boy we two managed to gulp down two bottles of the same by the time we left.¬†
Hardy's Cabernet Red Wine - must recommended if you haven't moved beyond Sula
Food¬†
Vegetarian Kebab Platter - Ok¬†
Fried Rice with Chilly Paneer - Nice (can be tried if you are hungry as they don't serve main course in Slounge and I don't prefer putting in that much effort to change a restaurant for food)¬†
Overall I pretty much enjoy the place if you going with your colleagues / business associates for a casual conversation over drinks. Definitely not a loud party kind of a place¬†
Ambience 3/5
Food 3.5/5¬†
Staff 4/5¬†
