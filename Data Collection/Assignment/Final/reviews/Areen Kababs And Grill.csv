"69583025","So yesterday for lunch we were wandering in search of some good place which we never tried or never been to! After searching a while, just as we were about to give up searching we saw a place named ""Areen-Kebabs and Grills"". It is located at Financial District on the 5th floor of Art Boutique Hotel! We were contemplating as to how this place would turn out to be, the happiness of trying a new place was on another level but at the same time we were hoping that the place and also the food should be good! We reached, parked and took lift to go upstairs and as soon as the door of the lift slided open we were into Areen or into the Cave of the Lion(that's what Areen means btw)! Very small place but very very efficiently used and displayed! It can accommodate around 50 people! But the interiors, the decor, the seating was very perfectly done! We just loved it! And also You have a nice view of the hilly area adjacent to the place! Overall the Ambience was really nice! We were welcomed by the Owner, Ali Khan, himself as he was present there! He is such a kind soul and a very warm hearted person! He has huge ambitions which takes into consideration not just his development but also of the people who are unemployed! His words are bound to move you! Felt really amazing meeting Him! Also he has good knowledge about food which he puts it infront of You describing about the food and how it was prepared! And one thing we just LOVED about this place is that they don't store food stuff! Everything that You get is freshly prepared! And one more thing to love about this place is that it is extremely pocket friendly! You'd be surprised to see the prices! Now coming to the food, we did not have much as we were running short of time! We had Tangdi Kebab, Loose Prawns and Schezwan Chicken for the starters and then we had the Chicken Handi Biryani! Loose prawns were one of the best we had! They were extremely soft from the inside and crispy from outside and also they were spicy! The softness of the prawns was because they were freshly prepared that's the reason most places serve prawns which are chewy which isn't the case at this place! Loose prawns are priced at Rs 190/- which is very economical! Next we had the Tangdi Kebab which was perfectly blended in the spices with the aroma of coal! Tangdi kebab is priced at Rs 130/- for which they serve two pieces! Next we had the Schezwan Chicken which was for Rs 160/-, it was juicy and succulent and rich in flavours! It was really delectable! üòç After we were done with starters then came the Handi Biryani! Biryani was extraordinary! Extremely tasty and perfectly cooked rice and tender chicken pieces! A must try at this place!
Also something very interesting at this place are their combos! You get a variety of things at a very affordable price! And for the people of South, they are coming up with South Combos starting this Friday! So watch out for it! And dont miss this place! A highly recommended place we would say! üòçüëåüèª
We would also want Asma Sharia| Phenomenal.everyday BeingHydFoodie Kamran Hussain Khan (Intensefoodcravingsblog) Javed Mohammed (The Food GlanZer) Tavleen Kaur Gandhi Love4cibo Riz & Shanky Rakesh ( TripAnzo ) to try this place for sure! üëçüèª",5,"2019-03-28 15:35:35",17,270,7

"8267981","I never expected that I would find a restaurant in Hyderabad which is not serving Biryani!
Ambience:
This restaurant is in Gowlidoddi, Jayabheri Four Seasons. Though it is quite far you can get a good long drive on the widened roads of financial district. It has a great cozy ambience. The complete ceiling inside the place is filled with decors of pipes where some of them is equipped with lights.
Food:
I already judged the food soon after getting to know that they are not serving biryani. We have order Veg silver and veg gold soup. The gold one was quite better compared to veg silver soup. Then we ordered Chicken deep fried kebab, Pepper chicken & Paneer Kebab. Chicken kebab was burnt very badly to a stage that one of the chicken piece looked like a piece of coal. Paneer Kebab actually tasted very good.
Since biryani was not available, we have ordered Chicken Schezwan fried rice and Paneer fried rice. Along with that we have ordered rotis. For combination with fried rice and rotis we have ordered Kaju Paneer and Chicken chatpat curries. Both the fried rice were good but the curries are really disappointing. I hardly found Kaju in the kaju paneer curry. And the chicken chatpat is equally bad.
I was not surprised with the taste of the food because I was prepared for the disappointment.
Service:
The service was just okay. Though this restaurant is deserted without any customers, we hardly find the staff to be at your service. We need to keep on looking or shouting for the staff for ordering further. And the main thing is that I doesn't even have a proper menu.
Cost:
The restaurant is very pocket friendly. You don't believe that for all the food that we ordered it just costed us around Rs. 1500/- Though it is cost effective there are many factors that need to improved.",2,"2019-02-02 23:45:33",64,540,11
