"16174233","The name is so appealing that when we saw it,we were like, yes let's go.
Because all of us just looovee the movie üòÅ
But also because it's on a busy roadside. Very convenient location.
It was Wednesday and had a ladies night I think. But as you know, gold can't be availed with ladies' night privileges üòî
We got seating very easily. Don't know of that was a good thing or bad, because the place was very empty. Only 2 other tables were seated I think.
Ambience is okay.. music- can be better. Cocktails were good. You can actually tell them to do some tweaks to your drinks as per your likeness and they would do it.
Service- can be better. was slow , when you look there were very less crowd.
Food is very nice. Pocket friendly place.
Hope next time I get to see a good crowd and good music",3,"2019-04-29 00:41:09",47,143,0
"156205","So now this has left me with no option but to write a review after coordinating with the manager Mr. Rounaq Ali to get my 678 + taxes INR back for the incorrect billing. I made the payment for a total amount and when I got back home realised that the bar used my Zomato gold coupon but didn't apply to the final billing. Utter disappointment. They need to ensure that they don't do an incorrect billing as everyone has trust. Sorry to say it failed here.

"2721394","I had visited this place for their lunch buffet which is priced at Rs. 499 + taxes. They had 3 veg starters (paneer tikka, Hara bhara kebab and Spring roll) and 3 non-veg starters (chicken tikka, fish 65) and also an elaborate main course.

"2169524","We were 5 friends and I specifically called to ask if stags are allowed. Manager told that stags are allowed. Once we reached, the bouncer refused us entry saying stags are not allowed on dance floor. I called manager again he also denied entry. I can't understand why can't they clarify the same on call.

"4877781","The most horrible and disgusting place I have ever been to. They have a big menu to offer but most of it is not available to be served. The food is the shittiest thing ever made and eaten in human history. The waiters are rude and incompetent to either understand hindi or English. The acoustics in the karaoke nights sucks. When we asked for a manger, three different waiters came to us and finally when we said we won't pay the bill until the manager addresses our concerns is when the amazing pot bellied, arrogant and rude manager showed up. His name is Ali and he was in no mood to listen to any of the feedback we provided instead he offered as 2 free drinks which we definitely didn't need because somewhere he already agreed with the feedback we gave but he didn't want to do anything about it. When I tried explaining him that we would pay the bill, add tip and don't want free drinks but we want him to take the feedback seriously, he was like ""if u r leaving, leave, why are u wasting my time?"" I lost it and I was telling my friend, I repeat, I was talking to my friend stating ""what the fuck is wrong with this place"" is when he interrupts me and says that I need to mind my language. I was like, WHAT? ""I"" am talking to ""my friend"" about the ""place"" What's your problem in that? And I literally said sorry even, joined my hands for forgiveness to which he replies staying ""ye badtameez ladkia yaha aati he kyu hai, tmko jo karna hai karlo, ladkiya he ho na, kya ukhaadlogi, UKHAAD lo."" So that pretty much defines this place, the food and the people. Don't be a fool to visit this place even after reading my review. But yeah, if u think u can reach Ali a nice lesson, please go ahead, all my blessings are with you üòã",1,"2019-04-08 00:32:29",29,54,0

"50266895","We went for lunch buffet.¬†
Very limited options for starter - 3 non-veg(2 chicken and 1 fish) and 3 veg(2 potato and 1 paneer). they were serving the starter cold. The tawa fish was over spicy and they didn't prepare a lesser spicy version of that even after our request. Only chicken wings was good.
Main course was kind of good. Egg fried rice and veg noodles were good. Chicken biriyani was stale.
Dessert was good. Chocolate cake, gulaab jamoon and Ice cream were good. Semiya kheer was horrible.",2,"2019-03-24 16:38:15",1,4,0
"30168649","Well sometimes rating can be misleading. We visited the restaurant first time checking its online rating but found it too be much worst than one can imagine.
The Beer we selected from menu was not available so we decided to go for bucket of Corona bucket. Bucket beers are either served in ice bucket or at least bar tender ask customers to check it is chilled. Well here the good bar tender bought all six beers holding in his hand and was about to open it when we checked its temp. We were surprised to find it almost equal to room temp. And the irritating part was when the waiter behaved as if its too normal to serve such beer.
We asked for the best food they have and in next 10 mins we had Dragon chicken served. Eating it all I can say if it's ur best then your worst is not for humans.
Next we ordered crispy corn not to surprise us crispy part was completely missing and masala added on top of it was enough to burn ur taste bud.
All i can say if you know what a good food, ambiance and hang out place Never ever visit this place.",1,"2019-03-10 20:37:28",16,52,1
"16625668","They have a good amount of space with decent ambience for large gathering, dance floor and a value for price. I have been there couple of times and really like their starters specially cheese starter. üôÉ I do hate their spicy potato starter as it just burns your taste buds. ‚òπÔ∏è
Service is also good and I love their all 99 Tuesday menu for starters and drinks as it‚Äôs all the worth. However, they should maintain consistency in having all those limited menu items available and not just make an attractive Tuesday menu for sake of it.
4 üåü mostly because the value for tasty food is worth it. Hopefully in next visit they don‚Äôt say we don‚Äôt have cheese starters in limited Tuesday Menu! üòõ",4,"2019-03-09 20:33:44",39,125,0

"33372056","This is my regular hangout place with my office buddies. The food was good thats the only reason for these 2 stars. But this review I'm writing is after a worst experience in this place. Last friday we have been to this place and we were looking at menu. my friend asked for a drink but floor manager said they don't have that brand. Then he asked for another brand again same reply. Then we looked at food menu and ordered chicken lolly pop then floor manager angrily said this is not local bar to ask everything whatever u eat outside. Then we literally got angry and said this is in your menu that's the only reason we are asking for it. Then he kept mum. We were literally pissed off by that floor manager behaviour and decided not to visit that place again.
Management need to take action against that floor manager or else they will lose some more regular visitors in future.",2,"2019-02-27 10:59:31",16,32,0

"30360006","We went today for an office team lunch. We were around 25 in number and had made prior reservation. Reached there at sharp 12:30 .We had to ask the manager to get all the seats as he allotted seats to some other customers despite of our reservations. The first started was served 1/2 hr after we were all seated. One plate of starter served by one person to 25 people. I had to ask the manager to add few more people to serve but he refused.¬†
After the first serving of 1 veg starter we waited for another 20 mins.¬†
My colleague asked the manager if more veg starters will be served, and this was his answer.
""Abhi aap ne kya khaya ??.. Panner khaya na.... woh veg hi hota"".
We were shocked to see such a response and rude behavior from him.
The staff serving the food were courteous, but this guy who I think was the manager was extremely rude. I finally had to getup and make him realize of his behavior.¬†¬†

"34532220","We went here for 31st 2018 Evening after reserving table for 3. They told us there will be 500 entry charge per person but that wont be a coupon inside to get anything. So it was 1500 for us 3 and food & drinks charges being seperate. We saw the menu rates online and felt it to be fine.
When we went there, for entry as they told 1500 we had to pay and that too they said they will only take cash 1500. Cards will be accepted inside but not accepted to take it for entry fee.
We always keep cards mostly, luckily we had that much cash, paid and went inside.
Got a table for 4 for us 3.
So like first mistake of staff when ordered a Mojito- Mocktail as I dont drink, and they instead of Mocktail send a Cocktail - Alcoholic Drink.
Second mistake of staff, as we are purely vegetarians- in beginning itself we mentioned that and ordered a paneer starter and some crispy potato starter. And they came and served Non Veg starter.
After complaining about this both to staff, they apologised and said it won't repeat.
Now when we repeated our starter and ordered crispy potato again, AGAIN for the 3rd time they sent incorrect order and a Non Veg Starter again to us.
I complained to Manager and he said sorry and staff said sorry but they didnt even had courtesy to make it up to their 3 huge mistakes back to back by any discounts which they could do LEAST.
Not that I asked for any but that was courtesy on their side.
So when all this wrong orders were going on in between of that we were asked to adjust on the seat of 2 and they made other people sit on our table across us even after reserving table and paying for it.
Ok and the last thing, the DJ mostly 70% of time was playing VERY OLD SONGS which I again didn't enjoy.
Oh yes and forgot to mention that they had increased prices on drinks and all food and had a whole seperate new menu for 31st December 2018 with increased prices.",1,"2019-01-07 15:59:40",5,78,0

Lights are almost perfectly dim. Environment/Ambiance is really nice. They have Ladies, Karaoke, DJ nights too. Service could be a lot better, as in they put the food on the table and leave you be.
Hard to miss the place as its just beside Gachibowli flyover. Enough parking space. The place remains kinda empty on weekdays.

"677679","We went to this place yesterday night for a colleague's farewell party.
This is situated adjacent to Over the moon hotel in Gachibowli.
We availed Zomato gold and got 2+2 drinks offer.
The staff was not polite and we were dissappointed with their behaviour, there were a couple of instances when they didn't understand our request and were a bit rude in their behaviour.
In starters, Paneer Tikka, Chilli corn salt and pepper and Egg bhurji pao were good in taste and we enjoyed having them.
In main course, we ordered Dal makhani and Paneer lababdar which were upto the expectations.
Nothing can be better than having a dessert to end the evening and we did the same by ordering Gulab jamun.
I must say, it was one of the best gulab jamun's I have had until now.
Wanted to give them 3.5 rating but deducting 0.5 for staff behaviour. ",3,"2018-12-01 15:44:44",328,1858,0

"32810543","This restaurant has its priorities straight. Unlike AB's, Flechazo, and Barbeque Nation- that swing for the fences and end up failing many times- this place has hit a sweet balance between Hospitality and Taste.
Which means you have none of the irritating, fake-friendly, over-eager monkeys from the above-mentioned places, pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don't want to.
Instead, you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business, until you order for something. Very professional, indeed.
The starters are awesome here; they actually set the tone for the things to come. This place features a wide-range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well, which is a big step up from its competitors. Kebabs are to die for.
Having said that, the main meal was nothing to write home about. They have tried a lot of things, from Mughlai, Intercontinental, to Chinese, but somehow these dishes don't come together on the plate.
But what actually took my heart away, what this joint EXCELS in, hands-down, compared to ANY FREAKING RESTAURANT IN THE CITY is the Desserts department. For someone who loves sweets, it's a psychedelic experience.
The variety and taste will haunt you for days. The desserts are neither too sweet, nor too rich. Just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about.
I was thoroughly satisfied, and if you leave out the clove-heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu, then the place is a RockaRolla discovery. Definitely worth one visit, and then the count will just keep on ticking! ",3,"2018-11-03 19:28:56",20,5,0
