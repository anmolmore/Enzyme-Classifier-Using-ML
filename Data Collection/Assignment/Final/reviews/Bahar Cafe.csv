"478838","I was on a work in financial district, it happens to be lunch time and after some somersaults we finally picked up this place. The ambience is of a typical restaurant type. Weâ€™ve ordered masala kulcha, kheema kulcha with kadai chicken. Masala kulcha was good but the kheema kulcha and kadai chicken was just ok. ",3,"2019-05-07 12:00:02",199,180,4
"40984746","One of the better places to have biriyani in this area. Fried piece biriyani is also tasty, although ideally there should be more pieces. Way better than paradise. I don't know what holds people back, because I have never seen this restaurant crowded despite good food and pretty decent interior. Perhaps it is the steep stairs that is deterring people.

"16173874","Not a good experience
Ordered a chicken dum biriyani for takeaway and mentioned for less spicy. After coming home, we saw the biriyani is full spicy and the chicken pieces are very small not worth the amount paid for . Also the rice quality not upto the mark, it has small stones.
This is not really expected from a restaurant like this.

Wonder if they know the meaning of hospitality. Went to have a peaceful dinner but walked out without ordering anything as the manager has spoiled the evening.

"16045762","I loved the biryani at this place, which is located at Indiranagar/ Vinayak Nagar above Ratnadeep market. Though it is a bit spicy its tasty at the same time. The ambiance is good atleastÂ I haven't seen it been overcrowded in all my visits. Apart from the biryani, i had tried chicken tikka butter masala which was equally good. The other times i had veg was mushroom and butter naan. Till now they have served well. So far so good :)",4,"2018-11-21 13:47:44",29,36,0

Leg pieces having good taste.veg Manchuria and baby corn was not that much good taste.for starter I will give 2.5/5 but coming to the Biryanies egg biryani is very less spice. There is no masala in the biryani. Its like a plain rice. All 3 chicken Biryanies we throwed completely into dust bin due to some bad smell is coming from oil they have used.we spoiled our team lunch by ordering from this restaurant.i will give 0/5 for chicken Biryani and for egg biryani 2/5.",1,"2018-10-19 12:58:01",48,15,0

"2698588","Famous name, but No quality-
Ambiance-
Bahar Cafe recently opened their new outlet at Times Square, Gachibowli. Ambiance is good, as they have taken a large place and decorated well with the lights. They have only indoor sitting available.
Food-
As I previously I had visited the other outlets of Bahar Cafe, this outlet loses a game. The food here is below an average and did not even meet the expectations. We ordered Tandoori Chicken which was fine, but the quantity was less as per the cost. We especially went there to have Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. As the name has Dum, there was no such thing as Dum inside the Biryani. It was just like a normal fried rice.
Service-
Service was very slow, even if there were only few customers.
Overall-
I do not recommend this place to anyone.",3,"2018-07-31 02:04:06",101,332,3

I ordered few starters, daal tadka and roti. The daal tadka was without salt and roti was not cooked properly. The worst part is when I shared my feedback with their manager, he tasted and accepted that food is not good and said the owner of this hotel doesnt want them to improve the quality of food. Wow!

The ambiance is decent, looks neat. Ordered Tandoori Chicken & Chicken Biryani, both were spicy and delicious. The portions were decent to serve two. Service staff is kid friendly and prompt. People who are fond of spicy food will like it. Value for money. Will visit again to try other other kebab preparations. Seems underrated.",4,"2018-07-02 10:44:28",90,117,7

Chicken Fried Piece Biryani was ordered and within 5 secs, we have requested for a cancel to order Boneless chicken biryani, they didn't entertain. Chicken curry special, they said it was their best dish for the day, turned out to be something that has been done so hastily, ordered and got within 2 minutes at the desk. The manager was not ready for cancellation, if cancelled, it will be a deduction from waiter's salary. Poorly managed restaurant taking away the name and fame of Hyderguda Bahar! If you have a choice, please visit other restaurants. Doesn't even deserve 1 star, ""No STAR"" is a better rating.",1,"2018-06-07 16:59:12",2,1,0
"8267981","We visited this restaurant at around 10.30 PM almost near the closing time. For appetizers we ordered pepper chicken. Though the taste was really good the quantity was really less that it won't suffice for two. Coming to the main course, Special boneless chicken biryani that we ordered didn't met our expectations as it was neither spicy nor having the savour of Hyderabadi biryani. Along with that we had Butter Naan with spl veg curry which tasted very good.
As I already mentioned that we have reached late there are no dessert options available. But finally as a coolant we had Mango Lassi and this was the best from all that we ordered. To summarize, I don't put this restaurant in the category of must visit as the food was not great and you don't feel the value for money. It is too costly for the quality of food and the ambience it offers.",3,"2018-06-03 04:45:02",64,540,6

"2763842","A friend of mine ordered the dinner from here on Sunday. This review is purely based on food experience.
We ordered veg biryani/pulao which was very very spicy, fish starter, it was good, nicely fried, the fish quality was good as well.
The prawn curry was very spicy, it was deep fried and coated then kept into gravy. This made prawn bit chewy. The gravy was decent.
The fish curry was good but the taste of fish was not up to mark.
There is extra masala into everything. Maybe that denotes a regional flavor.
Food quality is good. People who love spicy can try.",3,"2018-05-08 11:35:40",104,894,0

"36566953","Bahar cafe has many outlets in the city but not to be confused with cafe bahar.
We had been here for a quick lunch at the gachibowli outlet. We had a butter naan, lacha paratha and a veg kheema curry.
The butter naan was good , it was made crispy and thin. Lacha paratha was not so great, should have been cooked properly layered and crispy. The veg kheema curry was good, the vegetables were chopped into small pieces and well cooked.
The ambience was good and the service was decent
Overall it was a decent experience. I would rate this as

"50028394","It doesn't even deserve one star.Worst place I have beer been where the Stewarts abuse the customers.Prices are sky high and taste is worst.Though the customer is not satisfied,they will collect the full payment.They don't value the customers.You have to go through the worst arguments to get what you want.
I had chicken curry boneless which they said it would be medium spicy.However it was too sweet and we couldn't eat it forcefully.Despite this fact they did not cancel the amount that they charged for it.",1,"2018-04-30 15:51:03",1,1,0

"46418689","Bahar cafe lunch experience where in the lassi was the highlight. The food was average with prawns which were named as special werenâ€™t really big and above average in spice. The paneer kofta was more of gravy laced with paneer and kofta which was below average. The service was good and staff was polite. !! Good for biryani and lassi lovers ",2,"2018-04-15 16:30:25",8,4,1

Initially the entrance was very much upset
as we were very much hungry we entered and ordered for mutton kheema biryani and he provides me mutton biryani and when asked about it he says kheema piece size is that manner itself
anyway taste was also completely bad
not at all interested in coming back here
though I am a fan of bahar cafe (Malaysian township branch ) ",1,"2018-04-14 21:31:53",4,1,0
"1020746","I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone for these reasons.
Visited Bahar Cafe on 12 Apr 18. The Restaurant not at all lived up to expectations! we ordered food that is very generic in nature and taste wasn't all that great. we ordered for dal fry and the manager told no Dal dishes were available today. I cannot imagine any restaurant expensive or pocket friendly turning down request for Dal dishes owing to unavailability!
Tomato Soup- The soup had taste of Garam masala and Curry leaves. this is not something that I would expect in regular Tomato soup. To top it up the soup bowl had several pieces of Tissue paper and they came in my wife's mouth while having the soup. we alerted the manager and all he offered was a casual sorry
Paneer Tikka- Entire dish lacked proper seasoning
chicken hot and sour Soup- the soup felt as if it was made in tomato soup. still the taste was fine
Chicken Tandoori- The chicken was very dry and masala was overpowering and again the dish lacked seasoning",2,"2018-04-12 15:00:39",20,42,0
"53146586","I would like to rate -3 if provided an option. I suggest zomato to provide rating from -5 to 0 and +5. Coming to the point we had a team lunch on 9th April 2018 at so called famous Bahar Cafe at Gachibowli above Ratandeep super market. 
so my team mates ordered Chicken dum briyani family pack. the briyani was not served hot after my team mates tasted it was looking like it was a left out briyani of last day and chicken quality was not good at all. when ask the management the he said that it was cooked now and fresh and first served to us so my next question to the management was when it is fresh and first served then y the briyani was cold and not hot served and i asked weather he has ever eaten fresh and hot served food in his life, then he was unable to explain that. when we said we would not pay for this briyani rest amount will be paid.... then the funny reply came from that person if you want discount on the bill we can do that. someone has to explain them, boss we are not looking for the discount we are telling u about the quality of food you serve. 
At last we felt it was point less to discuses further with that kind of foolish management and paid the full amount and committed to our self we would not visit that place again.",1,"2018-04-10 11:14:28",1,1,0

We order a chilly chicken gravy, and 2 rotis and chicken biryani, but in less than 2 mins we informed the manager to please cancel the biryani and order another chilly chicken gravy. Unfortunetly they dont have a cancel option after taking the order. 
After calling the manager they say that sir there is no option to cancel the order. And it is a seriously a mood spoiler.

"7026711","Sorry Team - For giving this feedback . We have visited 4 people which was recommended by me to eat biriyani having experience of eating in another branch of this restaurant.
We have ordered chicken biriyani and veg biriyani . The taste it's very bad and there was no smell of the original biriyani . The cost is too high which hurts after getting the bad food. Quantity also does not match with the price may be due to its situated in the posh area. Experience was very bad after paying 700rs we came half stomach.
I have visited it's another branch twice and i liked the food there..
But I am very much disappointed here.May be will visit this restaurant but not this place again.",1,"2018-03-18 20:28:32",42,41,0

Either it is to get a quick biryani our gave there anyone tandoori roti. The discs are flavourfull and but in spicy side so beware of you cannot handle chilly but for now it's just best.
It's on top of ratnadeep and need to go buy lift.

"35919085","Visited with bunch of friends this evening. Place has a good ambience, not of a romantic date of lavish dinner. 
In the starters we tried Tangdi kabab, malai chicken and garlic chicken. Malai chicken and Tangdi kabab were awesomely delicious garlic chicken was average.
The main course was served as super late as it took 25 minutes of waiting with empty plates and stomachs.
However I was cheated when I ordered phulka but got chapati. Butter naan was usual. And keema naan was real lower than expectations. Chicken rogan josh was the only good thing in the main course. 
For desserts we ordered kala jamun, gulab jamun and gulab jamun with ice cream.
All were quite similar and it was more of sweet and less flavour.
Must try: Tangdi kabab, chicken rogan josh, malai chicken.
Don't try:phulka and keema naan. Stick with butter/better naan. ",3,"2018-03-03 01:06:03",18,508,2

Well organised setup.  Coming to food it's something like multi cuisines.  
Order for Chk manchow soup which is good.. 
Some special chk kebab OK OK.. But the price paid for it is not worth at all 
And Chk dumb biryani that main disappointment is biryani how come they call it as hyd dum biryani..  
Biryani is full of red chilli power...  Oh my God.. 
Service is OK..  Decent and you don't expect the waiters Tobe a fine dine staff.  
Order taking by the supervisor / floor manager in a tab. That something good.

"544627","I don't generally eat biryani in commercialised chains but I visited Bahar Cafe with a few classmates recently. Their biryani is actually good, with the right amount of spices. Apart from the chicken biryani, I had Chilli chicken, which was good too, albeit overpriced. The service was slow and they turned off the lights above us, for some reason. The place is heavy on the pocket for no reason other than a well known name (Looking at you, Paradise). If you start paying that much for biryani in Hyderabad, you're doing something wrong.

"423069","I went for dinner with my family. Ordered starter Ginger chicken and Chicken dum Biryani. I went with an impression of the Original Bahar at Hyderguda but it was nothing like it. The quality of Biryani was not up to the mark, very spicy and less pieces (no egg). Bahar is known for Biryani and I was disappointed with the quality here. Rice quality needs to be improved, although quantity is more but came with just 2 medium pieces for a family pack ( Rs 350 ). The positives are the ambience, space and location. Service was fast and ok. ",2.5,"2018-02-14 21:34:53",2,1,0

Chinese starters - veg Manchurian and paneer chilli were good. The special non-veg staters was mediocre. Coming to main course, dal tadka was nice. Nothing special about veg korma or kadai paneer. However, the staff was very courteous and helpful. Overall, the experience was nice.
