"1390049","The waiters have no clue of what items are available from the menu.
only 20% of the items on the menu are available.
the waiter keeps touching the menu when its in customers hand. they are not trained but good in nature.
the glasses are not clean and placed right on the unclean table inverted.
AC is not working, only 2 split acs for the whole restaurant and as a bonus they leave the door open.
ordered rotis but got chapathis as rotis are not available.
no washbasin to wash your hands.
worst part: while serving biryani in my plate, they accidentally placed the biryani bowl in my plate(which already had rice), terrible.
FYI: no icecreams as well.
good things: the waiter tried his best to make us feel better.though they are not trained they tried their best. payment options like phonepe and TEZ are available",1,"2019-04-23 21:35:13",3,45,0
