"108809627","I have been ordering choco chip temptation from Milkshake factory for the past fortnight. I enjoyed the ice cream the first two times, but today the same dessert was very disappointing. It was just a tub of vanilla with choco chips on top. There was none of the chocolate sauce and ice cream in it that we enjoyed so much.¬†
We also found pieces of plastic in our ice cream.Very disappointed in the lack of consistency.",1,"2019-05-13 17:27:46",1,1,0
