"31803205","Went for a lunch on a weekend. Ordered a biryani, in which I felt the rice to be slightly undercooked. The chicken do pyaza ordered had chicken pieces which were not mixed well with the gravy. Ambience is not same as what is seen in the photos. Staff is courteous but lacks experience in hospitality.
Could be much better!",3,"2019-04-20 11:48:43",2,3,0
"36621005","One of my worst dining experience ever. The staff took one and half hour to serve the main course and another half an hour to provide cutlery.Way to ruin my bday dinner with my parents with me actually leaving the restaurant empty stomach.",1,"2019-04-19 05:00:30",9,13,0
"1110557","I went to the Diners Pavilion, Gachibowli on April 14, 2019 at 8:15 PM to attend the birthday party of my friend's child's birthday. I asked security about valet parking and he said, yes there is valet parking, so I gave key to park my car. In fact, that security guy was very unprofessional, and He never told me that there is no valet and he parked my car in a non-parking area. I was shocked when I received a message from traffic police about challan which was issued on 15th Apr 2019 for traffic violation. In fact, it is very impractical, and owner should educate to security not to provide any wrong information. If restaurant does not have valet parking, then the customer has the responsibility to park her or his car.
With situation, I have no choice so I have paid the amount of challan, but would like to share my experience for awareness to others so individual can take care while parking their car based on valet parking.
Really, I am very upset with this type of irresponsible behavior. I never faced such a kind of experience in my life.",1,"2019-04-17 20:05:19",1,8,0

"34866082","From what I have heard about this place is that, it is more popular for its spread in lunch buffet. But we decided that we'd debut this place for some drinks post-work and barged into this otherwise dessert place around 9:30 in the night. Not very crowded on a weekday, nice ambience, clean washrooms, wide options to choose for (drinks and food), decently priced and quick service - qualities we usually look for in any good restaurant! 😊
Oh and they have a thing with throwing a desi touch to their dishes, which I liked it!
We had 6 bottles of beer at INR 700
Food (don't remember the prices):
Chicken caesar salad
Chicken Peri Peri pizza
Chicken chipote skewers
Overall, loved my experience. Would definitely go again, perhaps to try their lunch buffet!",4,"2019-04-04 22:39:18",43,314,0
"30526387","Visited this restaurant on a Wednesday night and it was empty with only one table occupied. Zomato gold confirmation was quick and we ordered a bucket of Budweiser which was offered at 700 (6pints). Ordered chicken peri peri pizza, chicken chipotle skewers and chicken ceaser salad. All three items were good and specially the pizza. They undoubtedly serve one of the best pizzas in town . Very soft thin crust and very tasty. 5 stars for their pizza
Chicken chipotle skewers were little chewy but tasted really good. Ceaser salad was very good too. Service by Aumit was appreciated
Would love to visit again for trying their other items in menu.",4,"2019-04-04 22:21:23",57,402,3

"37407502","A calm fourth floor restaurant. Interior decoration is very pleasant. Ordered Mint Mojito, Kaju Rice, Murgh Palak. They accept Zomato gold for food. The foods were nice tasty. But price a little costlier according to the quantity they served, (especially the rice quantity). Mojito was truly expensive 199 per drink.

Food is just okay kind of nothing great because we ordered soup ( manchow and veg nizami, Chicken Biryani- was pathetic) and in desert section also they don't give much options.
Service is okay and friendly but you might find difficulty to get someone who attend you. If you are going to family and then you might like it.",1,"2019-03-06 20:24:46",71,2079,0
"40129130","The management here is greedy.
The problem came when we asked for bill. In the bill they added 10% service charges and GST.
We asked why again Service Charges when there is GST.
First, they denied and later reduced 10% Service Charge.
The online payment method took 15 min to verify the payment from waiter to owner.
One big suggestion is, please check your bill before payment. Why should we pay 10% extra to these greedy people.
I will never recommend this restaurant.
I also have both bills and GSTIN number with me.",1,"2019-03-05 14:05:25",17,5,0

"68128143","Went to this place recently, it didn't reach upto my expectations. Its not at all like the pictures they showed in this app.
Ambience was just okay. Its a small room with hardly 10 tables.
The staff didn't respond like they should 🤷‍♀️
Coming to the food it's not that great. There were no boneless chicken starters also the items are very limited 😒. The main course was also disappointing.
The funniest part is there were only 3 deserts which includes vanilla ice-cream 😂, gulab jamun n some kind of sweet. And the fruits tasted sour.
This is what I got after spending 550 on the buffet.
I would never recommend this place. ",2,"2018-12-30 20:26:31",26,47,2

Loved the egg starter and the welcome drink.

"37392610","Ambience- Good for a family dinner. Warm Mellow lights are soothing. Although they should have a music system and play selected songs instead of just plugging in the TV and playing a music channel. The advertisements and random songs kind of kill the ambience.
Food- Taste and quality is upto the mark. We ordered Pasta and Salad. We wanted some customizations in our order and the staff was happy to incorporate that.

"46924316","Went with family on Saturday, Nov 3rd. Only one more table was occupied so was worried about the place. We were seated very quickly and food order taken quickly and served within reasonable time. Food was okay not that great taste, the chicken wings were good though. Choice of non veg soups limited to 4 types and only 2 of them were available that time. Chicken quesadillas didn’t taste like a quesadilla. It was like some chicken pieces wrapped in a roti. There is nothing compelling to visit this place the second time. ",3,"2018-11-05 13:13:23",2,1,0
"104322","3.5 Went here for dinner on Saturday night. Almost empty, only two other tables occupied. So were sceptical, anyways got seated. Inspite of this it took good 15 min anyone could attend us.

Being a vegetarian I'll surely recommend you to try their Stuffed Mushrooms, succulent and delicious. The Ulte Tawa ka Paratha was pretty good too.

But the service needs to be improved in terms of the staff availability for taking orders and re-orders. The food was quite average. Liked the veg nizami we ordered for main course.

"644896","A go-to place in Gachibowli (especially for Team Lunches😃😃 ) since they have an amazing offer running now.
449/- AI for Veg and 549/- AI for Non Veg Buffet.
~Ambience (4.5/5)
The place looks pretty bright with a golden yellow theme Chandeliers and wooden furnitures...gives d place a Royal Feeling ✌️✌️
~Buffet Spread (4/5)
Coming to the buffet spread, I really loved the fresh and soothing welcome drink, probably cranberry juice it was.
As for the starters, there were so many options and service was good too even at the wee hours of a Friday Lunch afternoon.
I really loved the Cheese Broccoli, Crispy Corn and Chilli My among the veg ones.
And in my non veg options, Chicken hariyali Tikka, Fish Tikka were amazing.
Next comes the main course, although I was a little disappointed with so less variety of dishes here, but the starters already filled my hunger pangs and I could only taste some cucumber mayo salad and Some nicely cooked Chicken Dum Biryani with a an okayish Mutton Roganjosh.
Last but not the least, we ended our lunch with Hot Gulab Jamun along with vanilla ice cream. There were some cut fruits and butterscotch pastry too but they weren't that great.
Yet again a disappointment in Desserts Section!!😐😐😒

PreBooked the tables online, got call back from restaurant asking for some advance money for the lunch. Something new which I didn’t come across in recent times. This somehow got sorted and when we came there for lunch,
They are on 3rd floor, when entered the lift - It was leaking water from its ceiling. 
Entered restaurant, look was good, our tables were arranged, we said about number of veg and non veg plates. Starters were served on the table. 
Service was very bad, slow and no one was very much bothered about refills, had to request multiple times for refills. Taste was mild, some lacked salt, some lacked spice. Over all starters were ok.
Then comes the main course and main culprit- when we reached for food, most of the bowls were empty. So waited for refill- in the meanwhile my eyes fell on available prawns curry. I got them in a bowl and few roties on my table. Prawns were raw.... yukkkkkkk.... not properly boiled and cooked. I said this to the manager out there, but got a cold response. I didn’t try anything else in main course, but some of my frnds said biryani was ok but others were bad.
Halwa, ice cream and cut fruits were on deserts. 
When were were done with our lunch- then manager came and apologised for the prawns and asked me to retry as he got them prepared again for me - it made me feel privileged. Had discussed on other items with the manager, and got my prawns in a bowl. To my surprise this was even pathetic experience. He mixed the older ones with the new curry and made it even worse. 
I Would highly not recommend this place. 
Sorry sorry for choosing this place for a team lunch.",1,"2018-07-21 08:14:52",8,134,1
"51227263","Beginning with the ambience, its okay. Nothing to great about it. But the food here is good. The quantity in starters are less. The main course is good. The food items that are worth trying :
- Chilli Cheese Naan
- Shrimp Fettuccine (for sea food lovers only)
- Thread Chicken 
Butter chicken and Lal Maans was okay, not that great. 
Under mocktails, I tried the Pino Orange, it was just a plain orange juice.
The starters, especially the fish was too salty. Need improvement there.
The service is really good. The food prices are affordable and overall a good place to have dinner.",4,"2018-07-20 22:05:41",57,513,0

The view and the overall ambience was beautiful. The menu of diners pavilion(they have the same kitchen) had enough choices and variety. We ordered basic North Indian and the food was heavenly. Great service and even after levying 10% service charge, the bill was pretty easy on the pocket (having Zomato Gold makes it even better!!)

The butter chicken had gone stale and smelt pungent. The adraki mutton's gravy was NOTHING but oil. Was shocked to see such atrocious quality being sent. What was more nerve wrecking was that I was banking on these dishes for my guest. Will never ever order from here. Wish I could give you a rating less than 1.",1,"2018-07-12 21:28:20",5,3,0

"35254703","I would rate this place 4 out of 5. Food - starters are tasty, they don't have more variety in main course for veg people but whatever they served was tasty also I feel there should be some more variety of sweets as when we went to this place we found only ice cream, cake and some halwa. We visited this place around 2-2:15 p.m and we were only left in the restaurant and I believe it was there closing time so they couldn't give more attention to us. This restaurant is worth giving a try.Team DP one suggestion add some variety in sweets.",4,"2018-07-08 02:06:32",36,532,0

The main issue which annoyed me was the non veg was being cut just behind where veg main course was served. We being vegetarian, it was not a very good site.
In dessert, initially only halwa was there and then ice cream and gulab jamun was added.
Starters were also extremely salty.
Overall, except the ambiance and good music, this place is not meant for us.",1,"2018-07-01 14:47:06",189,2316,5

"1349268","The food here is a total insult to restaurant business. I ordered lal maas- which was totally not the dish at all, it looked and tasted unhealthy(full of red onions, they shd hav named d dish lal piyaas). Neways, I asked the manager to replace the dish and he insisted on trying their adrakhi malai mutton which again was not the dish they had mentioned in d menu. Instead of adrakh they put garlic — a lot of it! with a watery type gravy🤣. Upon complaining, the manager said that their head chef has left for the day, hence the food is not the way it is. I mean dude! Seriously! thats your reason?. Guys pls stay away from this place. Its a place for disrupting ur digestives system, insult to your hard earned money and insult to the mutton they procured to cook.",1,"2018-06-30 12:53:05",72,120,0
"33219423","My second visit to this place. Visited this restaurant once, back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed. This visit was better than the last one. Was here for a team lunch with my colleagues, we opted for the buffet.
The ambience of this place is decent. There were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven, there was no salt and pepper on the table, also there were no condiments. Upon requesting, the waiter served us Ketchup and Green chutney. As we sat, the waiters started serving the starters. They included hara bhara kabab, aloo tikki, garlic paneer, tandoori pineapple, crispy corn and Chilly eggs. Tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants. Crispy corn, hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good. The egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average.
Veg Tom Yum soup was decent. The main course was a bit disappointing. Paneer Butter Masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name Kashmiri Pulao wasn't actually Kashmiri Pulao. The two other Veg curries tasted average. The desserts consisted only Vanilla ice cream, Gulab Jamun and Moong dal halwa. This was probably the most distasteful Moong dal halwa I've ever eaten.
The service was prompt. But, this place didn't give me any reason to why I should visit again, at least for a buffet. The only way they're different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks. But I think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back.
I've visited places less than 1Km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food. If they can't increase the varieties, they should start serving different/new food compared to others because I'm not visiting again if I can have similar food (and better) somewhere else.

"2537878","Had the “Prawns Phad Thai Noodles” and “Veg Greek Salad”.
RATINGS ::
1. Food Quality : 5/5
One word: Fantabulous!
2. Food Quantity : 4/5
Veg Greek Salad - Medium bowl
Prawns Phad Thai Noodles - Large Bowl (5-6 big prawn chunks, egg chunks, variety of other veggie chunks)
3. Food Packaging : 3.5/5
Decent packaging. Hot on delivery.
4. Value for money : 4/5
Bit pricey on scale. However, the quality is flawless. Worth it!
--------------
1. Prawns Phad Thai Noodles :
Big chunks of prawns (around 5-6) with Thai style noodles. Best part was the additional veggie varieties (cut in style) and egg chunks added to it made it stand out beyond just regular prawn noodles. Veggies were carrot, mushrooms, cucumber, onion etc.
Moderately spicy. A drink like ‘lassi/buttermilk’ would complement well.
2. Veg Greek Salad :
Standard fresh veggie salad containing cucumbers, tomato, black olives, onions etc. with a happy twist of creamy raita. 
The cream and raita accentuated the taste of the salad tenfold. 
True exhibition of healthy yet tasty food.

"33412516","The service was disappointing. The servers were in some hot mess - confused how to circulate the starters. We were five members, we got the table promptly as we had prior reservation. We decided to take the buffet. We were told that starters are being served pretty much like some other joints. The sitting arrangement in the restaurant is haphazard, mismatching furniture (probably some kind of interiors they thought to make a different style statement - which is not an issue for me). The welcome drinks were served only for 4 members in the beginning. Had to remind them to serve one more. Only three plates were provided, so after a wait of 5 minutes, the rest two of us got our plates. We told them, almost 3-4 different staff members, that two of us were opting for non-veg and three are vegetarian. They would either serve vegetarian options at a time or non vegetarian and then totally forget our table for 10-15 mins. We had to remind them to serve us more. Plus, they kept bringing the same starter again and again, despite telling us that there are other starters too. For e.g. crispy corns arrived at our table - I lost the count how many times! Some starters arrived only once. Some veg starters were cold !! Almost after 45 mins, the two chicken starters that they told us in the beginning arrived.  Main course was alright. After spending an hour, my appetite was already gone. I still made a selection of prawn curry, it was delicious. I had it with naan and some rice as well. Desserts were also running out of supply by the time we were ready for it. Overall, the whole excitement of having a team lunch at this place was lost, mostly due to poor service.",2,"2018-05-31 19:02:30",2,1,0
