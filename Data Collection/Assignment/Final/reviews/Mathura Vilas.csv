The manager was very rude, disinterested and had no concern with any grievances. The bill desk guy apologised on his behalf, but the manager just chose to walk away.",1,"2019-05-13 10:51:26",8,122,0

"46614388","Very bad service. 90% time you will keep on waiting for food. Even when i ordered thali, thwy took more than half n hour to bring it. Even the food was nothing compare to Rajdhani.....",1,"2019-05-05 14:55:39",2,4,0
"12627481","Tried this place after a long time. The order was just a south indian thali, peas pulav, Mixed subzi chatpata and a Strawberry milkshake.
Arrived at the restaurant by 2.15 on a sunday afternoon. After a full 40 mins the first dish to be served was milkshake!! Will a restaurant serve side drink / dessert first, when the main course is yet to be served?
Service 1/5 - you will see waiters only while ordering the food, once the order is taken you wont even see them coming to your table even to serve water. You will see them standing in one corner of the restaurant, few walking in and out of the kitchen as if they are very busy. But no one will respond when you raise your hand/ or call for them. I literally had ti walk to them and ask for water.
Ambiance 1/5 -
Some kind of strange smell comes similar to the one you get in a dumped wet cloths
In short a worthless place.
Food quality and taste 1/5.
Coming to the quality of food - the peas pulav had just peas in them i hardly found rice!.
Very salty mixed subzi chatpata dish which just had onions and capsicum.
As mentioned before the food was served after 40 mins. The south indian thali had a sambar - it was a hot water in which dhal was washed and rasam was just hot water; when requested for a refill of bindi (it was the only dish that was nice), I was told that the dish got over unfortunately due to the time. I seriously wonder what took them 40 mins to serve, I have never had such a bad experience before in any restaurant of this level.
Value for money - 0.5/5
For these so called high quality dishes I had to pay around 900. In short i will not suggest this place at all.",1,"2019-05-03 21:24:50",13,1,0

"41470496","I found this place pathetic. Went yesterday, most of the dishes we ordered were not available. The excuse waiter gave was that one of the chefs is on leave. I wonder if business stops for them if one the chef is not available.
I read on zomato reviews that their thali is good. And restaurant's menu on zomato mentioned that thali is available in dinner as well, but on reaching restaurant I found out they are not serving thali in dinner now. I travelled 9km to visit this restaurant.
Food was pathetic as well. Tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida. And the dishes were either too oily or just bad.
Overall this place is very bad and doesn't deserve a visit at all. There are plenty of restaurants all around Hyderabad which are much better than this for half the rate.
Avoid this restaurant at all cost !!!",1,"2019-04-17 17:53:21",4,4,0
"38055460","I visited the place yesterday for lunch with my family. This is usually a most loved place by all my family members and me for a casual dining. But yesterday it is a very bad experience we noticed the manger is changed. It took 20 minutes to find some one to take the order. Then it took him almost 30 minutes for the thali. I called the manager and asked why is it taking so long as we habe only asked a thali and lassi. Then he told us that some of the food got over so we are preparing it again so only it is taking so much time. But is was courtesy that he could have informed us that it is going to take time. After 40 minutes the food was served. But the lassi again took a very long time we cancelled the order and moved out. ",1,"2019-04-15 17:20:20",3,3,0

By the by, the pepper curry was the worst. Don't try searching for this in menu for this dish. It isn't there.

"38049215","For some reasons unknown to me, I decided to try this place. The thali on the other zomato reviews seemed worth a try I thought.
I was told thali would take 15 min, and I waited. After 25 min of waiting, when I started asking around, they said thali isn't available right now and will take another 20 min minimum. I lost it. No shame, no options to offer what could be served quickly. Just a plain no. I walked up, they asked me to pay for a bottle of water (which I consumed) and left. The manager didn't even bother.
Went to Over the moon next door and had a great exp. Folkd there told me this outliet of MV is in bad shape and likely to close soon.
If you want to take a chance of really poor exp, maybe no food, maybe bad food... ",1,"2019-03-17 19:01:23",34,232,0

"34408384","Had been here on Pongal to have ""Veg Lunch"" since my uncle and aunt were in hyderabad. My aunt insisted on having laccha paratha there which when arrived was found to be regular butter roti and the staff even insisted on the same funda that it was laccha paratha. This was a turn off for me but otherwise it is good veg restaurant to visit in gachibowli area.

"34895558","Absolutely delicious food! Telugu lo cheppalante - Kammaga undi!!! After several years I have found a South Indian thali in Hyderabad that is a perfect blend of taste and spices. Surprisingly every dish is tasty. It’s very rare that restaurants dare to include Karela/bitter gourd in their Thali. I should admire the expertise of the chef who included this fry by mixing it with podi. The brinjal curry/ Bagaira baingan is exceptional. I should mention the choice of the tender and tiny brinjals used in this curry. Aloo Bajji, pulihare, Anna paravannam/pongal, puri, papad, tomato curry with hot white rice made me get sleep right after the lunch. I give 5 out of 5, to the awesome chefs who can be an example to other restaurants, by keeping a simple menu and still impress the food lovers even without lot of spices/ghee/oil.

"30670751","Worst service and behaviour.
We ordered schezwan noodles. We were served spoiled ones from the morning. It smelled stale, sticky to touch and yak in taste. Worst experience. Asked the waiter to taste a spoon so that he will come to know the pathetic taste. He tasted and took away calmly .
Though I just had one spoon of it and returned back still they charged for it.
We spoke to the short fat manager for the charge levied on the spoiled food served which we didn't even have. He spoke very carelessly and extremely rudely.
Will never ever visit this again.
Strongly not recommended.",1,"2018-10-27 21:28:10",13,6,0
"48221211","Had Navratri thali here which was very tasty. Had a very basic taste and was totally abiding to the food eaten in fasting. 
Place is nice and small. Tends to become a little congested sometimes.
The only drawback is that this place is a little overpriced. Navratri thaali was for rs. 300 and other items are also a little expensive.",4,"2018-10-23 23:35:55",29,274,1

"2042074","Everything a veg foodie crave for (though I am not vegetarian). Form delicious food to amazing Mathura lassi. Though we ordered a-la-carte and enjoyed every dish gracefully, seeing the thali at a nearby table looked even more tempting. I don't much remember what we ordered as there were lots of dishes but every dish was a great experience. And do not forget to order Lassi. Service was also great!
Must-Have: Lassi
Ambiance: Quite good
Service: Polite and Quick
I will be visiting there to have Thali next time.",5,"2018-10-19 12:45:48",22,70,0
"34866082","this was our first visit to mathura villas. we had visited this place on the last day of navratri for dinner. they only had special navratri thali in their menu for thali so we decided to go with it. we were utterly disappointed with the food:
1) the thali was filled with sambar, green chutney and sweet chutney, 1 peas corn gravy, 1 alloo gravy, mixture, navratan kurma and dry banana veggie, sour curd, samudana vada, samudana khichadi, payasam, fruit salad
2) there was no dal, no kadi, or any orther sabji/gravy in the thali. except for the kurma and corn-peas sabji nothing was appetizing enough
3) welcome drink like chaas/jaljeera which is usually a part of any thali in india was not served. on asking the manager he tells us that chaas is a part of the thali but that they missed swrving us
4) only fruit salad and payasam was given to us in the thali. again we had to ask the waiters if they had served all that was a part of the thali. only after enquiring abt the items did they mention that there is yet another sweet which they forgot to include.
5) they only had plain rice for the thali
overall there was absolutely nothing ""special"" about the so-called ""special navratri"" thali !",2,"2018-10-18 22:50:54",43,314,1
"30526387","Disappointed with their so called special Navaratri thali festival .. they did not have any other option of thali during this time and when asked about north indian or south indian thali, they told that they have only special Navaratri thali.. we decided to order two of them..
Nothing special in this one.. by Navaratri thali you would expect kadhi, khichadi and some good options but this was actually a mix of north and south indian thali (utappam, sambar, payasam, kela sabji, mixture from South and tandoor roti, puri, corn n peas sabji, tikki from north) and small mixed fruits salad, green chutney, sweet chutney, plain curd.. they had just plain steam rice ..
They missed serving us welcome drink of chaas/lassi
Overall, disappointed for the price paid and options received.",3,"2018-10-18 22:46:36",57,402,0

Good ambience. Their thalis are good and a value for money.
Their ala carte items are not so good in taste and not worth the price(esp platters and other starters).
Their service is very slow and you need to be patient.

"3010162","Went here for dinner with family to try their notorious south indian thali, only to know that it is served only in the afternoon lunch, greatly disappointed and order north indian thali as there is no other go, and one corn fried rice.
To our delight, north indian thali was awesome, enjoyed every dish present in it, roti, channa curry, paneer, bhendi, and a gobi starter, each one of it delicious. Unable to finish the whole quantity as we were full with more curries. Sweet was very different and scrumptious.
Corn fried rice was equally palatable and went well with curries that came in thali.
Definitely try this pure veg restaurant, when you want a break from all those spicy and masala non veg dishes.
It was deserted on the day we have been here, not sure of the reason for less crowd. Ambiance is also great, service is reasonable and price is also affordable when compared other restaurants.",4,"2018-09-26 23:24:29",108,2531,2
"27632677","It was Ganesh Chaturthi and we decided to try something veg special . Having heard so many good reviews about this place , I insisted on going here. 
With a pretty decent ambience , this place is very easy to locate . The staff is courteous. We order the special thali which they were serving that day. It was a combination of both North Indian and South Indian thalis . Believe me, the quantity is so much and it is unlimited. 
There were around 4-5 curries out of which there was paneer, potato , cauliflower and 2 more . There were 2-3 sweet dishes including kurbani ka meetha. There was daal, sambar, curd and papad. All these were served with rice and poori and lachha paratha. There was also buttermilk as a complimentary drink.
The cost of the thali was 300 plus taxes so it costed around 330 per thali. 
For all those non vegetarian buffs like me , u will love this place if you like to experiment with vegetarian options too sometimes . And my vegetarian friends, u will love this place. So just get going and have a foodilicious experience.!",4,"2018-09-21 18:54:01",48,134,5
