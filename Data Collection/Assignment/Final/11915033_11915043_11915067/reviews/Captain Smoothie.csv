"51385400","Fruit and Nut muesli smoothie was very good. It was all natural. Once again impressive smoothie from Captain smoothie. It felt little more sugary. I hope much sugar isn't added. He straw could be thicker you know so that the bits and muesli can easily pass through. ",4,"2019-05-04 14:25:08",60,16,0
"36263035","Captain smoothie - Gachibowli may be a bit difficult to find. It sits deep in the resident area around Laxmi enclave.
The place is quite solitude and if you are looking to find some peaceful time, this is a place to come.
I had gone there with my friend and we ordered chocolate milkshake and captain smoothie shake. To be fair the taste was pretty decent. Nothing extraordinary. The prices were reasonable and the staff was quite friendly. I was not much impressed with the lightening conditions but thankfully the choice of colours for menu were decent enough to be read.
Overall with friendly staff, quite and solitary nature of the place, it makes a good outing if you want to spend some time with your beau. But all in all I would call it an average place and rate it 3/5",3,"2019-04-09 23:04:07",59,182,5

"51385400","Green cleanse detox smoothie is amazing. My personal favourite from Captain Smoothie. Loved the touch of lemon and ginger. It was very flavourful. It's a good thing that spinach is used in this way that we don't even realise. Can see and feel other ingredients apple and mango.",5,"2019-04-02 21:34:37",60,16,3

"51385400","Oh beauty detox drink containing majorly of mango was superb. Sensed pineapple as well and one can easily see sabza (basil) seeds. The seeds might have not been pre-soaked. Was really looking forward for how turmeric would be used as it was mentioned in the description. Sadly failed to taste turmeric and banana even though they might have been mildly used. A very good combination for smoothie. A must try.",4,"2019-03-19 16:46:55",60,16,4
"51385400","PB banana smoothie was very good. Can taste as well as smell the banana. Peanut butter was subtle and good. Good natural combination. It's good that the drinks are kept as natural as possible. Good concept.",4,"2019-03-18 18:33:36",60,16,0
"51385400","Ordered slim and trim detox smoothie and one can actually taste as well as see spinach(didn't think spinach could be used this tasty and healthy way), pineapple, banana, cinnamon. Peanut butter was mentioned in the menu but it was nowhere to be sensed. The restaurant can add quantity enough to sense from next time. A very good concept from Captain Smoothies for easily affordable healthy smoothies.",3,"2019-03-13 22:07:53",60,16,0
"35360087","This is a new place that has opened up in the streets of Gachibowli that are lined with paying guests .
The ambiance is pretty minimal - dim lighting,cozy sofas and some little chairs and tables. The choice of music is very nice though !
We tried their Banana Milkshake and Choco Brownie Shake.
The Banana Milkshake was okayish . But one good thing is that it is completely natural with no added sugars or flavors . So if you want to have healthy drink, you can try their wide range of fruit based shakes.
The Choco Brownie Shake was normal. Nothing extra ordinary.
The place can do much better in terms of the food quality. Given the location of the place, if food is a bit nice , this place can gain a lot of customers.
If what you read is in any way helpful for you , do like the review and follow us ! We would be happy to bring in honest reviews about different restaurants all across India ! üòÉ",3,"2019-02-24 02:43:01",67,264,1

"69970310","Best place for smoothie lovers
One of the best places to have real all-natural smoothies, Captain Smoothie offers a variety of combinations that are sure to punch your taste buds.
After looking at their menu, I first ordered Dream Machine. It was really tasty. This smoothie contains strawberry, banana, and my favorite pineapple. I really love there concept of making these. Then I decided I must try a few more, so I ordered Lord Mango, Appie Chikoo, Water-Millionaire and one of their specials, Captain Delight.
I thought where can they get mangoes is this season. But then they have preserved real mangoes. Along with mango, pineapple and yogurt are also added to this. It was amazing!
Then I moved to apple chikoo which contains apple, yogurt, chikoo and banana. It was something new for me. I enjoyed the real and healthy smoothie. Then water millionaire contains watermelon, mango and strawberry thyme.
Then last I had their signature smoothie captain delight, which contains mango, strawberry, pineapple, cold pressed orange juice. It was really good.
The overall ambiance is really amazing, and the staff very friendly. I would recommend all to try Captain Smoothie with their friends and enjoy their smoothies.
Must try smoothies:
Apple pie
Captain delight
Lord mango
Strawberry limey",5,"2018-09-13 09:21:00",28,1624,0

"38201383","Gem of a place hidden in the bylanes of Gachibowli. Captain Smoothies is a place with Warm ambience which is nice for a date night or hangout.
I was there with a group of friends. We were looking for something refreshing and what better than a variety of natural fruit smoothies.
We had various flavours which included Popeye's Secret, Strawberry Limey, Divine Grape, Lord Mango, Captain's Delight and Apple Pie. My personal favourites were Strawberry Limey and Apple Pie but the others were great as well.
Strawberry Limey was different than the usual Strawberry smoothies around. It had a touch of lemonade along with strawberries which made it fabulous and took it way ahead of the pack.
Apple Pie was another great find for us. Along with delicious apple flavour, the smoothie was filled with dry fruits which enhanced the taste.
Attention to detail and prompt service at Captain Smoothies are a few things which made us appreciate the staff there.
A wonderful place for all the smoothie lover's. The huge variety of natural flavours on offer and their taste will make you a fan instantly.",4,"2018-09-04 02:21:14",129,599,7
