"34774600","I ordered Non veg butter rice combo. So the packaging is good, and the quantity as well. This combo contains 6-7 medium sized chicken chunks, of two different flavours, a sunny side up poached eggs, a stripe of cooked paneer, and beneath all this is mildly fried butter rice. With this pack also comes a gravy packet and a raita packet. Overall it is a good meal, with enough of meat and food quantity.",4,"2019-05-16 22:58:46",22,161,1

"60984746","Ordered Laccha Paratha, Soyabean Wrap from this place via Zomato. 
Received white floor(Maida) based oily Laccha Parantha of small-medium size and wrap filled with Soyabean chunks.
While was expecting some mouth watering flavours. However it could make sweet buds tingle as it missed majority of sauces including basic ones. Tasted more of mundane than something of tadak dharak.

"1635511","Ordered dinner from this place today. The Butter Chicken Combo. It came with about 6 bite-sized pieces of chicken, two pouches - 1 with some gravy and 1 with onion/cucumber raita, a fried egg, a piece of paneer and a LOT of rice.
Taste was quite ok overall. Few peeves I had are that the gravy was exceptionally watery. There was WAAAAY too much rice than the gravy, so once you're done eating the chicken, paneer and egg even with spoonfuls of rice, there is still enough plain rice to fill a plate! I didn't get much taste of butter, but like I said, overall it wasn't too bad.",3,"2019-03-19 19:41:52",86,646,0
"27725380","Orderd momos and paneer wrap from this place, food was cold , specially momos tastes good when they are hot and chutney of momos should be very spicy which was not in this case.
The oil they used for wrap was not good which was making the food bad

"31676376","Food was quite good. They had forgotten to put one soft drink in my order, for which they sent another delivery agent to deliver it. This made me happy because usually some delivery restaurants ask you to order again so that they can send the item with the next order(why should I order again?). The taste of the roll was quite good, but I think faasos is better (but more expensive).",5,"2018-09-17 22:28:44",11,1,0

"45345846","Eatsome appears to be a pocket friendly eatery, offering a wide variety of snacks for a decent price.
HOWEVER, in truth, Eatsome has some of the most BORING and BLAND food I've ever eaten in my life.
The food isnt bad, per-se.
You see, it is ENTIRELY TASTELESS.
They package the food well, and it gets to you while still warm. But the moment you bite into your food, you realize the truth.
I kid you not, they dont even put salt in their dishes.
A short recap of what I've tried, on multiple occasions, on different days :
1. Mini cheesy chicken wrap (the cheese was a slice of the processed stuff)
2. Chole wrap (absolutely ZERO taste. I tried to add salt and ketchup. Very little improvement in flavor)
3. Chicken bhuna wrap and chicken tikka wrap. I couldnt taste the difference. Both tasted the same.
4. Bbq chicken wrap. Tasted too sweet.
5. Chicken mayo wrap. Bland AND soggy. Yuck.
6. Double egg wrap (stuffed to the gills with onions. My breath smelled of onions for hours later)
I, for one, wouldnt order ANYTHING from Eatsome even if they offered it for free. Would you eat some dirt if someone gave it to you for free?
Stay away from here. ",1,"2018-07-04 11:30:51",27,3,0
