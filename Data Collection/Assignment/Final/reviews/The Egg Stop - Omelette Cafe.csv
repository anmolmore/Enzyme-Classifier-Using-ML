"60220833","I ordered a shredded chicken omlet where I found only 5 small pieces of chicken in the omlet and the price is like 125 without tax. Food I ordered doesn't satisfy hunger and I recommend not to order any item from this restaurant. Food is not worthy at all. ",1,"2019-04-12 10:22:20",6,1,0
"35210001","Ordered omu fried rice. It was literally an omelette and a few spoons of fried rice. The quantity is so less it wouldn't even fill a child and it's for 114 plus tax plus delivery. You can see in the picture the amount is not even half the box it came in. Plus ordered lemon tea. Not a hint of lemon and was so sweet, couldn't even have more than 1 sip. Very disappointed.",1,"2019-03-31 13:46:49",2,1,1
"52192579","The fried rice and noodles I ordered was very bad. It's is not worth the money at all. I ordered fresh lime juice and it tasted just like plain sugar water. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone nor order from this restaurant again. ",1,"2019-03-24 16:36:37",1,0,0
"58482848","Taste is good but prices are exorbitant. We will feel that all Omelettes are similar in one way or the other but prices vary vastly. They take a lot of time to prepare even we have the food at the Restaurant. So the popularity has gone down drastically now.",3,"2019-02-15 14:01:13",1,0,0
"47826285","Tea parcel is not upto the mark, Tea is parcelled in a plastic bag that is not at all hygienic and hotness is not there after delivery. Delivery charge is 10 rupees in what basis. I will suggest some healthy container that will keep the hotness for atleast an hour that is delivery time.",1,"2019-02-13 22:34:11",7,2,0
"945677","This is what almost sub standard food in inadequate quantity looks like. I ordered the egg-chicken Maggi and egg salad. I doubt if there was any chicken in the Maggi. Both the items were done fine, but it was nothing different or value adding. The taste was average and quantity below average. So, at the price this becomes costlier and poor on value for money.",2,"2019-01-24 01:18:12",9,1,0

I called to delivery boy and he told me that is the correct order I have delivered. I checked my order again but it is chocolate toast only. Zomato customer support didn't gave any proper response when I contacted through chat.I lost my money.",1,"2018-12-25 13:39:29",48,15,0

"50201224","No wonder they have this bad rating. Right in the good food centre they placed it well but the service & the quality is worst. Been here for at lunch time still no sign of single person in store. The servers forget them they don’t have any. I only saw couple of workers looks like underaged (not really sure though) anyways ordered a BBQ egg n chicken burger cuz what could possibly go wrong with burger. And surprisingly it went wrong, the patty wasn’t cooked good enough. The egg omlet was overloaded which spoiled the taste and as well their presentation. I would never recommend this place. Management u have lot of outlets i am not sure of other outlets but u got to improve a lot in this store!

Im not an egg lover but this place is gud enough to make it tasty. One best dish from this place is chicken egg fried rice. Its egg and chicken combo rice with fried egg on the top. It was really delicious. One not to try dish in this place is egg monaco which tastes horrible.

Westerners seem to love this dish and they make the world crave for it posting the most intagramable fish and chips pics all the damn time. So I decided it was time I needed to try this delicacy.

Service and ambience - 3.5/5
The fried fish was oh so good and the best fried fish I have tried outside home. Crumb coated and deep fried, tender as hell and seasoned to perfection, I am still dreaming about having a bucket full of those.
Come along with a side of crispy french fries and mayo dip and a loaf of toasted bread. The feast was amazing.

"43573341","The Egg Stop located just opposite DLF Gate No. 3 where mostly you find fast food kinda Junction. From outside, its look simple but from inside you might feel like yellowish / eggishhh.  
Thought to have quick food enter to this café where almost 15-20 people seating arrangements at a time. As unable to find staff, hence I stepped ahead and pulled one menu laid on table. And finally, I made myself ready to go for “Mexican Omelette” with bread and ordered the same with note- to make it “full spicy”.
After spending 15 mins went to check the status where I got response that – it will take another 20-25 mins! Ufffffff, for just a bit they will keep you waiting because they (only 1 person) mainly focus on online delivery orders rather than dine customer.
My recommendation- If you don’t have any other option and you are full of free time then only suggested to visit this place.
