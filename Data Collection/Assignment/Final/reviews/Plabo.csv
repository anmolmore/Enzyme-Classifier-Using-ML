"69857587","Visited Plabo a couple of times, and both for the purpose of different birthday parties. Their game zone is a kids magnet and hence the venue doubles as the best location for having kids birthday party in and around Gachibowli area. Kids will be thoroughly entertained with different activities and games available here.
Now coming to the food, I only happened to try the options that were part of the party buffet menu. Once it was french fries, chili garlic noodles, and veggie thin crust pizza. The ingredients were quite fresh and tasted good. Another time it was Arrabiata pasta and baby corn capsicum fried rice, along with chili garlic bread, potato wedges, and samosa. It wasn't disappointing either!
They have a small cafeteria too serving several other items. Best place for parents to relax, and converse over food while the kids play to their heart's content in the play zone.",4,"2018-10-03 21:41:12",7,0,6
"886088","the place has loads of options for kids to explore and enjoy and learn as well. however the staffing was not apt as they were behaving very lousy. we had to call them and ask for it. while I read through the feedback about the cafe which did not relate much to me coz the service I received at the cafe was also good. they had prompt service and were courteous as well. overall a good experience and a place where kids won't mind spending full day and yet not get bored.
however I also feel that the options can be much more as there are varieties available for the crowd. ",3,"2018-05-09 09:23:37",161,1216,3

"418026","Worst place to eat. Staff is rude and unapologetic. They don't bother to fulfill your order unless you remind them a couple of times. Food is substandard in both quality and taste. I am oblivious to how anyone could go wrong with fries and fresh lime soda. majority of the cafe staff is running around clueless. Don't bother to order if you are here.",1,"2017-04-16 17:13:44",2,51,0
"39857685","Been there for a birthday party last week. Food was so bad that me and my kid couldnt have it at all. Most of the guests took just couple of spoons. Starters we had potato smilies which were very state (looked like it was reused), same with spring rolls  (the cabbage smelt rotten).  VEg noodles were ok but very dry. Ice cream melted and when asked to replace - they refused ! Not a happy experience.Wanted to review them on facebook - but guess facing backlashes they have moved the option of reviews on fb.",1.5,"2017-04-10 11:03:39",1,1,0
"145935","We ordered the mocha blast and lemon soda both of which were good but we had to wait for quite some time to get the order. Ordered Mexicana pizza and chilli garlic wedges both of which were pretty average. Total bill was 771 which was ok. ",3,"2017-03-19 20:33:40",130,530,0
"897223","the only good thing about this place is the playarea. restaurant/food besides the fancy cutlery and decorative seating...which is not even kid friendly (sharp table corners etc) there is nothing great about it. most of the items on the menu isn't available. Fries are the most basic/simplest thing to have for a place that caters to kids. Even that is frozen and dry. Go here if you want bling and are ok to compromise on the taste.",2,"2016-07-03 21:54:41",30,17,0
"34580819","I have experienced a very unprofessional valet car parking facility. I visited the Plabo Gachibowli center  around 2.30 PM IST yesterday. In was informed that you dont have self parking facility and I was forced to give my car to your drivers. The car (red color SUV) was delivered with a big dent on the rear door. 
I now need to spend a good amount to repair the dent else need to move with a dent. This is one of the worst experience.
