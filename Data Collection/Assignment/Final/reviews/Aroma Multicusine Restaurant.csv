"30770089","It's a quaint underrated palace in jaybheri enclave. I loved their decor and service the most. The lunch is open all day that makes it ideal for people who like to laze around in weekends. We were offered the crispy corn which was one of the best dishes. The panner butter masala was a tad bit sweet. They have Chinese and Indian dishes for lunch and their tandoor opens at night so that is a heads up if u are looking for kebabs. Definitely revisit.",4,"2019-04-28 16:36:08",344,974,3
