The tuna sandwich is a win if you like sea food. There are shakes here too ,which are not up to the mark comparitively.",NA,"2019-05-16 20:05:40",18,64,2
"73212","Absolutely pathetic. I placed an order for half kg mocha walnut cake. The order was taken over call and rest of the communication like what message is to be written on cake etc was done on whatsapp. When I called the next day to collect the cake, they could not find my order. I had to call multiple times and finally I was told my order is ready. Upon reaching the outlet, the message was not written on the cake and they hurriedly packed a cake and gave me. When I asked them if this is really mocha walnut, they said yes you can see the walnut on the cake. They even had no idea of how much payment is remaining or how much I have already paid. Upon reaching home when the cake was cut, we realised it is not mocha walnut but butterscotch!! The outlet cheated me and so I called them and blasted over phone. I reached the outlet at 10:30 pm at night and slammed the cake in the store and demanded my money back, I was paid back the amount but the experience was terrible and bitter specially because it was a b'day cake. The store management is pathetic and there is no coordination or even an ounce of professionalism in them. Never ever going back and I strictly recommend anyone to go at their own risk. I will, for sure, completely avoid this place.",NA,"2019-05-16 18:53:10",13,63,0

The food was decent, but the service needs to improve. Had some mosquitoes, the tables were not cleaned promptly after the guests left.

I ordered Paneer chilli pizza, peach iced tea,chilly cheese tpast and pink sauce pasta...all of them were okayish.
Pizza was perfect indian pizza, tasted like panner chilly gravy on pizza base and pasta also had a very Desi taste to it, they put carrots in pasta which didn't go well at all.I only like the chilly cheese toast which were toasted to perfection.

I happen to have come across this bakery through few of my friends and I was blown away with the things they had to offer.

"494070","Staying in ramky towers we frequent this place quite often. Although little did we know how incredibly disrespectful the staff really is. We found a hair in an ice cube inside the iced tea, when informed the staff on the counter about it , they willingly accepted it without checking. 10 minutes later one of the staff folks comes back saying "" are you sure there is a hair "". Only to find out they had removed the ice cube which had the hair. After quite a discussion they brought the executive chef ( who literally just stood there with absolutely no contribution to the discussion) eventually when one of the staff's members (nandu in the photo) asserted that he'll personally pay for it we asked for the owner's contact, who then waived off the bill.

The pizza was fine taste wise but it can't be called a Margherita pizza (had few strands of shredded basil that was dry). All the sachets of oregano seasoning expired 3 months ago, in June and when we opened the sachets there were a lot of clumps. It's okay not to give any seasoning if you don't have it but sending expired stuff is completely unacceptable. The delivery and packing was good. Wish they had paid same attention to the food.

The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good.

Their Madras coffee is soothing, refreshing and amazing!!
I tried their cappuccino, but i will go back to have the Madras coffee again probably!!
They bake their own breads, so the sandwiches are a must try!
We ordered grilled chicken sandwich and egg sandwich with focaccia bread and trust me they were mouth watering!! The stuffing was adequate, and it had the PERFECT crunch!!
Also i will vouch for their grilled chicken salad. It is loaded with chicken and veggies and are so filling!!
They also have counter with freshly baked cakes, muffins, breads and cookies!!
So, though the menu isn‚Äôt that elaborate but whatever they are offering it is quite good!!
Price wise its ok with the quality and the quantity of the stuff they are providing!

My only gripe - wish the dark chocolate cookie was equally consistent. On some days it's great, but feels stale on other days.

"61718852","We had gone to Old Madras Baking Company in the past for buying bread but never sat down and had a meal there. We were out on a Saturday morning to check out a house right opposite this place. It was raining and my husband wanted to have some coffee and that is how we landed up here. The place is very chilled out, there was no one at our table to check what we wanted to order despite the place being almost empty.
My husband placed the order for us,a mushroom omelette for me and a roasted mushroom makhani sandwich for him. I'm usually not a coffee person but the weather demanded a hot beverage and filter coffee was the first thing that came to my mind. We ordered 2 filter coffees and 1 bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was amazing with the coffee. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese but my husband is and he loved it. We made a pact to go for breakfast every Saturday mornings after this because I realised what an important meal I was missing due to my laziness :)
Would recommend this place to everyone for sure. I for sure am going back again for the bagels and coffee!",NA,"2018-07-21 14:27:10",14,5,2

"990918","The Old Madras has been our go to place for some nice coffee with a sandwich whenever the weather is nice and you want to enjoy it sitting outdoor.
The coffee is quite good, with a lot of variations available. The best part is the freshly baked breads. Those beautiful, soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter. Even the puffs and Victoria cake are nice to have.
Coming to the worst part - the service. In all my visits over the past couple of months, this has been the biggest turn off about this place. Almost always, I had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over. Second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating. More often than not, you can see flies buzzing over the tables. Though the kitchen looks quite hygienic.",NA,"2018-07-08 23:08:01",60,355,0

"43637214","This place is located near the HDFC Bank inside the Meenakshi Bamboos Commercial complex in the Gachibowli area. I went there along with a friend as I read great reviews about their Doughnuts and Cakes.
My First impression about this place was that it had a nice decor and relaxed seating areas, both indoor and outdoor. We went there around 1 p.m. and it was very hot, so we opted for sitting indoor.
We tried many cakes, cookies and doughnuts here and I liked most of them but my favorite are:a) Red Velvet Doughnut [Rs.60] which was freshly baked and was stuffed with gooey cream filling.
b) Salted Nutella Doughnut [Rs.75] which was very soft and stuffed with Nutella.
c) Banana Cake [Rs.155] which was moist, soft and cake like sweet bread. 
d) Dark Chocolate Cookie [Rs.50] which was once again very soft but was not too sweet.epicureantales.com",NA,"2018-06-28 00:14:03",443,2461,21

Ordered a mushroom sandwich which came in brown bread with a pinch of basil and tomato sauce. The filling had bell peppers and there was no extra grease which was the best part. 
They bake fresh bread everyday and each of their items look so good. There is a variety of options like bagels, custard buns, brownies and croissants. I also tried their multi grain bread which has flax seeds, millets and other healthy seeds. It was totally yummy! 
Worth the price you pay for and for conscious eaters there's always an option here. They will customise food for you. ",NA,"2018-06-22 10:02:18",1,59,3

The pasteries are great, the four cheese pizza is amendabe and the alfredo pasta is amazing. They have a wide range of milkshakes as well. Also, they allow you to bring your dog and sit outside so props. The indoor seating is kind of too bright and uncomfortable, but the outdoors smells like smoke and has many mosquitos so seating is kind of a dread when I go there.

Decided to then just pick up their sour dough bread and try it out. This morning after having tried it, I probably am glad I didn't dine there. I would have to rate their sour dough bread as to the worst I have ever had! Guys, you are a baking company; how tough is it to make a decent sour dough bread given you must be in this baking business for some time?!",NA,"2018-05-14 07:45:12",38,51,0
