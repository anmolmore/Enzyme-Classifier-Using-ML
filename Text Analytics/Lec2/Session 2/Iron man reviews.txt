"result.1","The first disc features 11 deleted and extended scenes. There's more of the opening ambush with Tony Stark being more proactive. We also see more footage of Rhodes and it quickly becomes apparent that he was the character with the most scenes cut from the film. We also see Tony and Pepper Potts attend another party.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the impressive ""I Am Iron Man,"" a 108 minute making of documentary that can be viewed in seven segments or altogether, taking us through various aspects of the production. For example, we are taken step-by-step through the construction of the Iron Man armor with Robert Downey Jr. cracking jokes while being fitted for it. It's amazing how much of the suit is practical and looks really good in person. This is due in large part to the genius of the late-great Stan Winston and his company. Also included is plenty of soundstage footage of scenes being filmed.<br /><br />""The Invincible Iron Man"" is a six-part documentary on the comic book, tracing the history of the character. Stan Lee says that he modeled Stark after Howard Hughes, for the most part. He also mentions that he was never fully satisfied with the look of the armor - hence its many changes over the years. This doc also covers various key characters and storylines in excellent detail with several people who worked on the title over the years talking about their contribution to the mythos. This is a very well done overview of the comic book.<br /><br />""Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man"" examines the CGI work that went into realizing Iron Man's powers, like flying, his repulsors, and so on. Director Jon Favreau says that he likes to use practical effects whenever possible, which is wonderfully refreshing to hear, and in this film he mixed the practical with CGI.<br /><br />""Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test."" Incredibly, the actor had to do a screen test because the studio deemed him a risky proposition and this footage shows that he had a handle on the character very early on.<br /><br />""The Actor's Process"" features fascinating footage of Jeff Bridges and Downey rehearsing a scene with Favreau. It's great to see these guys at work and offers insight into how they put together a scene from the film from an acting point-of-view.<br /><br />""The Onion's Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into Full-Length Film"" is a funny satire where a newscaster ""breaks"" a story of how the Iron Man trailer will be made into a film that pokes fun at the rabid nature of the hardcore fanbase of the character.<br /><br />Finally, there are ""Galleries,"" featuring concept art, technology stills, behind-the-scenes photographs, and poster art."

"result.3","There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flick...let's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.<br /><br />Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out back story. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.<br /><br />The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, ""no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can."" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic Lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liaison, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show ""Dinner for Five"" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.<br /><br />One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.<br /><br />Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the back story and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years."
"result.4","Once again I begin with a warning that you need to sit through the really, really long credits for what might be the best cameo appearance since Sean Connery showed up as King Richard the Lionheart at the end of ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000092T6M/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves</a>.""  That was the last time I remember people really applauding a cameo in a film, although I should point out that everybody left at the end of the first showing of ""Iron Man"" were True Believers who instantly recognized the actor and the character as soon as the first words were out of their mouth.  Ironically, the cameo by Stan Lee in the film seemed to go right by the audience, because there was no reaction to what was a pretty good gag (it happens when Stark shows up at the big party).<br /><br />Now that I have that bit of business out of the way, let me say that ""Iron Man"" is the best comic book superhero movie I have seen since ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Spider-Man 2</a>.""  I would say that the latter is better, mainly on the strength of Alfred Molina's wonderful performance as the villain and the great fight sequences between Spidey and Doc Ock that take place on the vertical as well as the horizontal axis, but ""Iron Man"" might be the more solid film (i.e., lower top but higher bottom).  There was a point when the number of comic books that Marvel was putting out exploded (e.g., the New Universe titles) and I dispaired over all of the idiotic cloning with Spider-Man and was down to reading only two Marvel titles: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785107576/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Daredevil</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078512764X/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Iron Man</a>.  This was back when Frank Miller was doing DD and Tony Stark was a full-blown alcoholic.  Daredevil might have been cooler, but as Iron Man, Stark always had the advantage that he was a regular guy, by which I mean that he did not have any superpowers.  He was just a really smart guy who could invent the gadgets that would make Iron Man work (eat your heart out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000294TC4/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Ned Kelly</a>).  That is certainly what we get with director Jon Favreau's pre-summer blockbuster, with the added angst of Stark growing a conscience and using his armored alter-ego to help restore balance to his own little corner of the universe at war.<br /><br />Ultimately the best parts of the movie are the opening act, in which Stark is captured (Afghanistan today instead of Vietnam of the Sixties)and has to built the metallic grey Tin Woodsman on roids prototype armor, and the second act, where he works out the new suit.  This movie has two or three of the best violent slapstick gags you have ever seen in one of these movies, which engenders some of the biggest laughs.  The origin of the character is fairly faithful, for being updated, to what happened in ""Tales of Suspense"" #39, which was plotted by Stan Lee, scripted by his brother Larry Leiber, drawn by Don Heck, with a cover art by Jack Kirby (who created the character's original look, although it was Steve Ditko who first drew the red and gold armored version).  There certainly is more than a touch of ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Transformers</a>"" to the way Stark dons the Iron Man armor, but as much as I would give credit to the specific effects in this movie, attention must be paid to the screenwriting teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby (""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Children of Men</a>"") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway.  For all of the humor in the script, there is a strong thread of serious stuff extending throughout this film.<br /><br />As Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., a superb actor whose skills in the verbal repartee department were honed on ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V8952K/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Ally McBeal</a>,"" may well be the most glib superhero we have seen on the silver screen.  Certainly he is more glib than we would every have suspected Stark to be, but of course Downey's personal life clearly echoes the character ark of his character (it is that resonance as well as his undeniable talents that make him perfect for the role).  As Pepper Potts, Gwenyth Paltrow is more of a romantic  figure for Stark than she was in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785118608/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">comic book</a>, especially since Happy Hogan (director Favreau) has been relegated to a minor role as Stark's bodyguard to make room for the character of Jim Rhodes.  However, the point is not so much potential romance as it is the fact that with Paltrow we have an actress who can go toe to toe with Downey in quick paced nuanced conversation (although many will think that Downey's best scenes are with his robotic assistant with the fire extinguisher).  Besides, by have Rhodes instead of Hogan we not only get another acting talent on the level of the Downey and Paltrow with Terrence Howard, but as fans of the comic book know (and the movie acknowledges), one day down the road Jim is going to get to be in the red and gold suit.<br /><br />Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is set up as a godfather to Tony Stark and a regent to Stark Industries instead of being a rival munitions magnate, which provides a bit of Oedipal conflict to the proceedings and compels the big fight at the end to be with Iron Monger (I was actually hoping for Titanium Man even though I was half expecting the Mandarian).  But most people who come to see this movie are not going to know any of this stuff, and even most of the comic book fans who will end up making repeat trips to the theater to see this one are not going to be old enough to remember the original Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts who ended up with Happy Hogan versus the ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785121382/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">The Ultimates</a>"" version of the character.  All that really matters is that the cast and characters are a perfect mesh and the people who put this movie together should be thinking not just about a sequel but about a series.  With this launching platform, Iron Man could well replace Superman in the Big Three of comic book superheroes in the movies along with Spider-Man and Batman."

"result.6","Please Note: Opinions are like...well you know how the saying goes. If you have one, write a review the voting system is for those who HAVEN'T purchased the item and whether or not the review was helpful in that decision.<br /><br />""Titanium Alloy Man"" just doesn't have the same ring to it as ""Iron Man"". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is ""The Merchant of Death"" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark almost literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.<br /><br />He uses the crude tools to build a suit of iron that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by becoming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. Heck, even the DVD is one of the top notch ones I've seen in recent years. As for the issue with TrueHD sound--Paramount has fixed that issue remanufacturing the BD and still meeting their release date.<br /><br />The extras are stunning as well. We get a full documentary ""I AM Iron Man"" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre-CGI work, design elements to on-the-set wire work involving Robert Downey, Jr. Director Jon Favreau (who also plays Happy in the film)manages to seamlessly combine CGI with pratical physical effects such as puppets and the men in suits. His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa. We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out. There are also stills galleries, screen test, a featurette ""Invincible Iron Man"" that gives us an idea about the development of the characterwith interviews featuring many of the Marvel bullpen who contributed to metal head's development, ""Wired"" which provides us background on the physical effects/visual effects of the film. ""hall of Armor"" takes us into the development of the ""suits"".<br /><br />Director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters. It may lack the darkness of ""The Dark Knight"" (ironic considering that ""Iron Man"" is really Marvel's version of ""Batman"" except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the ""Spider-Man"" films directed by Sam Raimi.<br /><br />The nice thing about ""Iron Man"" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book).<br /><br />Marvel's first in-house production ""Iron Man"" demonstrates that the comic book company turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins. Just a reminder--after the credits roll DON'T turn off your TV or BD player. There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third ""Iron Man"" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of ""The Incredible Hulk"".<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 9/30/08 FYI, if  you are having problems playing your disc select ""No"" if a menu comes up asking if you want to turn on BD Live or change the options in your settings for your PS3.

"result.7","A little worried about Iron Man being just another so-so Marvel movie, such as Fantastic Four? Well don't be. Actually you can stop reading my review now if you want and get up and go watch this movie.<br /><br />If you're still here (oh ye of little faith), then I'll try and help you with that tendril of doubt still holding you to your computer chair preventing you to get up and spend the 300 dollars it costs to go see a movie now. 600 if you are taking a date.<br /><br />Let me first start off with Rob Downey. I for one was hesitant with him being the man who is playing Tony Stark (Iron Man). I rolled my eyes the first time I saw his name a year or so ago when I found out about this movie being made. Even when I saw the first pics for it. But let me tell you right now... the man IS Tony Stark. He's got this role down. I haven't seen this good of a Downey movie since `Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' and `Wonder Boys'. At first I thought he was a total jerk at the beginning, but then realized it's just his way of being funny, and it's absolutely fantastic. Through the whole movie Rob will have you laughing quite a bit. He's not only funny, but he's also quite laid back with his genius. He doesn't bash your face in with how smart he is. To show you how smart he is the film shows a bunch of scientists trying to create something that just isn't possible with today's technology. Though Tony Stark was able to do it an Afghan Cave with spare parts from junk.<br /><br />The film is about Tony Stark. The son of Howard Stark, also a genius. Tony inherits the company from his father when his father dies. He's basically partners with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges who also played the part brilliantly). Stark Industries is known for producing military weapons that, according to Tony, needs to be used only once to end a war. Tony soon finds himself captive of an Afghan rebel group that want his weapons made for them, because whoever owns his weapons, basically wins the war. Tony creates the classic Iron Man suit to get out of the captives hands and once he does, Tony decides he doesn't want to create weapons anymore. He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it. The rest of the owners of Stark Industries isn't to happy with this and they decide to, basically, just not listen to Tony anymore (can't think of the word for this... sorry). While Tony's company is basically doing whatever they want, Tony is in his mansion revamping his original build of his suit. Not to ruin anything about the story (I promise I haven't ruined anything yet, I told you mostly what you can see in the trailers), lets just say Tony is about to put his new suit into some good usage.<br /><br />The special effects were used just right. I honestly didn't think they would be able to make Iron Man look that cool or move that cool. Well let me just say, have no fear, because he rocks. From the classic Iron Man suit to the new. The old Iron Man walks just like you think he should, a bulky machine. The new, well, lets just say you would almost not think he's wearing a suit it's so human like, but just enough machine movement to know it's not completely fake looking. I don't know how to explain it, but it looked great.<br /><br />Also the action scenes were great. I think one of the biggest reasons why they were so good is that they were used sparingly. The movie isn't action packed but has just enough to not tick you off that there wasn't enough and also not to many to over do it. It was just right. Which in turn helps the story out, because it helped give us that character development that a lot of people complain about in these Marvel movies.<br /><br />One last thing I want to say about the actual movie is that Gwyneth Paltrow wasn't bad. I'm someone who really isn't fond of her acting. But she plays Pepper Potts, Tony's `assistant/butler... whatever', and she did a really good job. Paltrow in a supporting role, instead of a lead, is a much better combination, in my opinion.<br /><br />In the end, I think everyone will enjoy this movie. Go take a second loan out so you can pay for gas, movie tickets, and popcorn and coke (maybe some twizzlers if you go donate some blood first) and enjoy a day at the movies! Make sure you stay past the 10 minute credits to see the special ending.<br /><br />P.S. When you see Iron Man fighting, imagine him being 2 or 3 stories tall. Just imagine it. Now picture him with an Autobot or Decepticon emblem on his chest. Now watch him fight. See how cool it is to actually see what the heck is going on during his fight scenes? Maybe in Transformers 2, Bay will be able to put a coherent fight scene together that the viewers can actually tell what is going on instead of watching a bunch of polygons mish mashing together."
"result.8","Having watched this movie on a plane ride, my first impression was that I really liked the movie. My second impression is that it would look nice in HD. Thankfully Marvel Studios and Paramount have delivered a great Blu Ray release w/ HD video.<br /><br />So the way the movie itself goes is typical super hero movie type stuff. If you aren't a fan of comic book style suspension of disbelief, please move on. You won't like this movie anymore than you did the other super hero movies out there.<br /><br />Tony Stark, the sort of spoiled, super intelligent and conceited owner of Stark Enterprises finds himself in an impossible situation. While traveling through Iraq to show off his great new weapons the Humvee he is in is attacked and he is captured. He awakens to find that one of his captors has installed an electro magnet in his chest to prevent mobile shrapnel from the explosion Tony was caught in from reaching his heart.<br /><br />In captivity he's asked to build one of his top of the line missiles for his captors, a Jericho missile. Instead he builds a prototype Iron Man suit and escapes. The experience changes his life and has him attempt to change his company and the world from the destruction he and has company have profited from.<br /><br />Action, betrayal, small amount of clumsy love and that is Iron Man in a nut shell.<br /><br />The video is presented via the AVC codec and looks amazing. The only areas of ""problem"" would be in the cave scenes. You can tell when the film stock changes or perhaps, if it was filmed in digital, grain was added to the video. The areas most affected are darker scenes and scenes where there is interaction between the prototype Iron Man suit (done in CG) and his environment and the terrorists. It's either an artistic decision or a choice to make the CG interaction less perceptible. It doesn't take away from the scenes and it doesn't detract from the movie.<br /><br />The audio is done in Dolby True-HD and sounds fantastic. Lows are low and highs are high. No clipping, no distortion and great separation of channels over all.<br /><br />Having bought quite a few Blu Ray discs, I'm painfully aware of the lack of HD extras. Not so with Iron Man. This release has 2 discs in it, one for the main feature and a few extras (deleted scenes) and one for quite a few interesting and in depth documentaries. And yes, the documentaries are ALL in HD. This may be the first Blu Ray disc I've purchased with all HD extras.<br /><br />Also included is a BD Live connection. I have not yet created an account and logged in to see what's available, but even if all you have access to is what's on the disc, the extras are amazing. Not sure about the BD Live extras.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a super hero movie with some amazing video, amazing audio and amazing extras, look no further than Iron Man on Blu Ray.<br /><br />FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING LONG LOAD TIMES:<br /><br />If you have a BD Live capable player, in the menus of your player, turn off ""auto download"" and set it to confirm (or something along those lines). The reason the movie takes ""forever"" to start when you first insert it is because the quiz portion from BD-Live needs to be downloaded and installed on your player. Just turn off auto install/connect and you should be good to go.<br /><br />And once it is installed the first time, assuming you wait, you won't see it again unless you get a new player and want to watch the movie."
"result.9","The movie itself is fantastic, but the disc could use some work...  If you own a PS3 the geniuses at Paramount decided to make you download the BDLive content before you can watch the movie, causing the ""Blue Ring of Death.""  So basically, it's not an error, it is a feature lol!  If you wait long enough, it will clear and you will be able to play the movie.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if their severs can handle the numbers right now (1800 hrs on the east coast with the #1 new movie = a loooong download time).  The other option is to turn off your internet connection during B-ray movies on you PS3 (check under BR options).  This will allow you to skip the download and get right to the movie (just download it later at a better time)."
"result.10","Okay, first off if you own a Web Enabled Blu-ray player like a PS3, you're going to have to wait a long time before you can watch this Blu-ray after you pop it in. Why? Some pinhead executive at the movie studio/blu-ray production house thought it would be cute to require you to download some stupid software you're probably not going to use for ""extra features""  BEFORE you can even get to the main menu. I had to wait so long to watch it I thought the disc was defective. I had enough time to call Amazon and arrange a replacement. (Then I installed installed Windows XP to my MacBook and I was still waiting. If you've ever installed XP you know how long that takes too.) This means that each time I pop this Blu-ray into a new player, like if I take it to a friend's house,  I'm going to have to tell my friend(s): okay let's just wait an hour then we can watch the movie. This is completely and totally absurd. I hope whoever decided this was a good idea gets fired.<br /><br />After about an hour and a half, I was able to watch this movie though. It's a really great movie. It's right up there with WALL*E and The Dark Knight. It has a very fun comic book feel to it, while not being absurdly stupid. If you can suspend your disbelief for 120 some odd minutes, it's a great ride.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is a great Tony Stark. When I first heard he was cast as Iron Man, I thought ""yeah right! This movie's gonna suck."" But I was very wrong. He pulls off the ladies man/billionaire playboy/hot shot role very well. But this is only half of the movie: The other half: Iron Man action scenes are just flat out cool. The poses/angles they choose and CGI work are all great. This is a first rate production.<br /><br />Also, I didn't know who his assistant was before the credits rolled  but she looked familiar (Turns out it was Gwyneth Paltrow) and she made a really interesting character too, for a supporting role. You even have Jeff (""The Dude"") Bridges in there doing a great job playing Stark's second in command.<br /><br />Oh, and when the credits roll, don't turn off the movie. There's a little scene after all the credits that fans of the comics and fans of this movie shouldn't miss.<br /><br />Summary:<br />The Blu-Ray gets a 1 star for the incompetence of whomever decided it was a good idea to make people download something before they could even see the main menu.<br /><br />The Movie Gets 5 Stars for great execution - cast/acting, storyline, effects, and action scenes. Dare I say: This is the best Marvel Comics movie to date."
"result.1","Seriously, thanks god for Robert Downey Jr., the actor was brilliant in the movie, after watching the movie i couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the role of Tony stark, the guys was simply brilliant. Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors who can offer a lot more then he's given chances to prove himself. It's mostly because of his drug and alcohol problems but no one cannot deny that he's an outstanding actor who never acted in big budget movies. Not until now as Iron Man..<br /><br />Jon Favreau was obviously given a lot of money and he invested it wisely and brought Comic successfully back to life. ""Iron Man"" has its holes, like not so convincing start but everything since the time Stark returned from his captivity is good and entertaining story. As I said before Downey Jr. is a thing this movie needs, just like always excellent Jeff Bridges in role of Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />In this cast I didn't like Gwyneth Paltrow. She has some rough moments, and this definitely wasn't her best performance, but she didn't bring down the film by any means. Great supporting turns by Terence Howard as Tony's associate and erstwhile friend and Clark Gregg as a tight-lipped fed make director Jon Favreau's job helming this adaptation a HUGELY better result than the flavorless ""DareDevil"" from 2003.<br /><br />So ""Iron Man"" is good for fun and as blockbuster that would fill cinemas, but for a place in 250 best movies, I think not. This is a satisfying film from at least three levels: for those who love superhero movies, it's great; for those who enjoy a good message movie, it's only BARELY preachy and always able to keep it frenetic and true; and as a summer film, it's large and captivating, never letting the viewer go till the credits (and perhaps even STILL during that)! While I cannot quite go all the way with 5 stars for this film, it's a very strong 4. A strong movie-going experience for most anyone who likes ""Summer"" films."
"result.2","Jon Favreau (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADFY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Swingers </a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Elf</a>) effectively directs the screen adaptation for the comic book superhero Iron Man.  Favreau has some fine-tuning ahead of him in terms of directing action films but Iron Man is still among the very best comic book character based films so far.  It is about as entertaining as you can get and the few flaws that are present are almost entirely forgivable due to Favreau's knack for developing characters and also understating drama effectively.  It might be important to note that it is hard to contain myself and write an honest review, because in all of my years of reading comics, Iron Man, along with perhaps the Silver Surfer, is my favorite comic book character of them all.  Fortunately for me, unlike last year's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMPW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Fantastic Four sequel</a>, this particular film truly delivers in terms of satisfying the little long lost comic book geek-boy dwelling in my brain.  There were actually moments during the film that I looked over to my brother in full wide-eyed geek-mode and said things like ""that stands for S.H.I.E.L.D.!""  The kid in me absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />Iron Man, for the uninitiated, is really Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), Chief Executive Officer of weapons manufacturing giant Stark Industries (think Lockheed Martin run by Donald Trump).  He is an arrogant womanizing alcoholic who just happens to be an MIT graduate and a technical genius unlike no other man of his time.  It is as if Leonardo Da Vinci was sent into a time machine, given a mansion, several bottles Johnny Walker Blue, and no reason not to celebrate his lust for women.  In other words, this is not Superman.  Stark is flawed and Favreau so graciously provides us an opportunity to watch him grow as a man and as a machine in his ever-evolving nearly indestructible self-made super armor.  In the beginning, Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and unbeknownst to his enemies, he is shown the error of his ways as a weapons manufacturer and begins building his suit as a way to escape his kidnappers.  A new man with new motives, Stark develops his suit further and becomes an unlikely but befitting hero.  Look out terrorists and look weapons manufacturers, including you Iron Monger!  I only wish he could've cleaned up that ugliness in Iraq on his way home.<br /><br />One can tell by the promotions that the special effects are great and they are amazing from beginning to end.  However, the screenplay is very solid, especially the humorous, fast, and witty dialogue for Robert Downey, Jr.  The chemistry between Stark and his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) works remarkably well and far better than I would've expected.  Jeff Bridges is also great as the villain Obidiah Stane and the rest of the cast is solid all around, with the exception of perhaps Terrence Howard he unfortunately seems to be going through the motions here.  But overall, the magic of this film is the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead role.  He is perfect for the role in almost every way.  Somehow he gives us a hero we feel compelled to find a reason to root for despite his flaws.  I'm not sure another actor could've pulled it off.<br /><br />This definitely receives a high recommendation from me for pretty much anyone looking for a fun and compelling action movie.  For fellow lovers of the Iron Man comics and other crossover stories (i.e. Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D.); do yourself a favor and stay until the credits are done rolling, you won't regret it."

"result.4","Wow, what a ride! Iron Man is a blast from beginning to end. I'll give a brief plot description for anyone who is not familiar with the comic book:<br /><br />WARNING: SPOILERS<br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.)  is an American arms dealer who is fabulously wealthy and lives the high life. Girls, booze, parties, he does it all. Standing by his side and cleaning up his various messes is his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Whispering dark thoughts in his ear is his partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who you know from the beginning is just not okay.<br /><br />Tony goes to Afghanistan to demonstrate Stark Industries' new weapon, the Jericho missile. His convoy is attacked, his American soldier escorts are killed, and he is seriously wounded by shrapnel from one of his very own bombs. He passes out and wakes up as a captive in a Taliban-like camp. His captors want him to make them a Jericho missile, and he is horrified to see that they have a huge stockpile of Stark weapons. How did they acquire them?<br /><br />With the help of surgeon & fellow captive Dr. Yinsen, Stark makes his first Iron Man suit instead of making the Jericho missile. Using the suit he escapes and creates a big scene that attracts the attention of the U.S. military. He is rescued by the Air Force and returns home. During Stark's escape, the first Iron Man suit is all but destroyed.<br /><br />Back in the States, Stark builds a sharp new Iron Man suit, and goes back to Afghanistan to rescue Dr. Yinsen's village from the terrorist group that had captured him. The military can't figure out what Stark is, so two F-22 Raptors are called to intercept him. He inadvertently damages one of the planes but saves the pilot. Stark then confesses to his Air Force buddy LC James Rhodes (Terence Howard) that he was the cause of the accident. In addition to playing with his new toy and messing with the military, Stark is also determined to find out why the ""bad guys"" have so many of his company's weapons.<br /><br />He unravels the mystery with the help of Pepper Potts and decides he needs to change the mission of Stark Industries. His partner, Obadiah Stane is not pleased and comes up with a suit of his own; he becomes ""Iron Monger."" You can guess what happens, but suffice it to say the final battle scene between them is everything it should be.<br /><br />My husband dragged me to see this movie, and I ended up absolutely loving it. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as always; he is one of those actors that your eye is naturally drawn to while he's on screen. The rest of the cast is very good in support of him. The score is fantastic too (I have already downloaded both ""Merchant of Death"" and ""Driving With the Top Down"" into my iPod).<br /><br />Remember: Tony Stark is a grown-up superhero and this is a grown-up action movie. A good bit of it  takes place in a war zone, and there is plenty of violence and some torture. Of course it is necessary to the plot, but you should be aware that this may not be the best movie for small children.<br /><br />Bottom line: Iron Man is a blast of a movie that manages to touch on some real issues we are facing today, but never becomes preachy about it. LOTS of fun, a rollercoaster ride, a rocking action movie with a sense of humor. Loved it, and can't wait til the DVD is released!!"

"result.6","Perfectly cast and executed tremendously with laid back ease, ""Iron Man"" is proof that Marvel still has what it takes to dish out the good stuff. I have to admit that I was starting to worry about the future of Marvel's films after seeing the pathetic ""Spider-Man 3"", ""Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer"", ""Ghost Rider"" & ""Elektra"", but ""Iron Man"" has put life into a franchise that has seemingly been going downhill, ... quality wise that is.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. has done something with his Superhero that other actors have yet to try with theirs, ... loosen up, have fun and add some humor. The screenplay does a wonderful job of adding issues that American's fear at this particular point in time, using the war on terror to make the film more realistic and envolving. Also, Jeff Bridges really does break out in the second half of the film to create quite a villianous character.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
"result.7","Although not as well known as other Marvel Comic icons as Spiderman or X Men, this film adaptation of Iron Man works due to the sure hand of director Jon Favreau (Swingers, Elf) who cleverly mixes action, drama, humor, and a totally winning performance by comeback actor, Robert Downey Jr.  In terms of a first film showing a superhero's origin, it is the one of the best to date.<br /><br />Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer whose cavalier attitude and playboy appetite are matched only by his sheer genius in technology.  On a tour of his weaponry in Afghanistan, he is wounded in the heart by shrapnel and captured by rebels who order him to build a super weapon of mass destruction.  With the help of another civilian, Stark changes up and instead builds a powerful suit of high tech armor that sustains his weak heart and enables his escape but not without a price.  Guilt ridden and traumatized by his experiences, Stark has a literal change of heart and alters the militaristic direction of his company much to the chagrin of his elder partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).  A couple of friends, his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and military liaison, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), stick loyally by Stark's side despite his earlier predilections.  Intent on improving and perfecting his Iron Man suit, Stark experiments with its design and takes dangerous risks.  His mission is to utilize his Iron Man technology to fight the evil in the world, starting first in Afghanistan.  When the truth comes out about what Stark Industries is really doing with weapons sales, it leads to a deeper conspiracy and a battle of titans as Iron Man meets an old foe.<br /><br />Buffed and in terrific physical condition, Downey is quite convincing as the prodigy whose initial devil-may-care attitude must undergo a transformation.  (It is not without irony that the role and the person should merge in light of Downey's real life, personal setbacks.)  The movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes the most of his role.  Bridges is great at playing a businessman with a sinister agenda.  Paltrow strikes sparks with Downey and you yearn for more scenes with the two of them.  The same goes for Howard as Stark's best friend.  What is a little hard to swallow is how Pepper and Rhodes could put up with such a pompous persona in the early goings.<br /><br />Favreau has an amusing bit part as an assistant to Stark.  Further, the robotic voice that assists Stark in his technological work is actor Paul Bettany!  And yes, Stan (the man) Lee, one of the comic book creators, has a fleeting cameo.<br /><br />The scenes, which show Stark developing his updated Iron Man suit and test-driving it, are realistic and at times amusing.  The Iron Man suit 2.0 is a marvel of construction and is the coolest thing imaginable. There is no way that this concept of a hero could have been rendered as convincingly even a few years ago.  My how movie magic has caught up with these stories finally and done them justice.  It is clever how the film incorporates the original Iron Man design (which brings to mind a sort of poor man's version of Robocop) and progresses through its more modernized version.  Pure fans of the original comic (including myself) are thrilled at the reverence paid to the classic beginnings.<br /><br />There is an aerial battle between American fighter jets and Iron Man that is a lot of fun.  The special effects, while being among the most realistic and cleverly used in any action film, are well integrated with the strong narrative.  Despite the eye candy, you get the feeling that the filmmakers never lose sight of what the story is about and how to stay focused on the characters.  The pacing is excellent.<br /><br />In terms of subplots, the Afghan conflict hits close to home with the current war in Iraq.  Also, the secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gets an introduction as support for Stark and figures to have a bigger role in future Marvel movies; don't forget to stay until the credits are done for a bonus.  The film has an edge about it in dialogue and theme, and is better for it especially in the final scene, which is surprising and has implications for future adventures.<br /><br />I would put this film on par with Batman Begins and Spiderman, not bad company.  While not as emotionally stirring as the best moments of X Men United or Spiderman 2, this is only the first of what likely will be a long running franchise.  If the sequel can maintain the same quality as this effort, we could be in for the best superhero movie yet!  And lest there be any doubt about Favreau's ability to take on comic heroes, don't worry; he understands what they mean and how to do them justice.  He `get's it'!"
"result.8","Man, this thing has been advertised like crazy - I've seen way too many commercials, trailers, action figures, and news all over the net.  Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreu have been more than confident they have a winner in Iron Man.  With the amount of hype I think I got burnout and I wasn't that interested in seeing Iron Man afterall.  Everyone I talked to loved it so I figured why not.  Turns out everyone was correct and you can believe the hype folks - this is one great film, and sure enough one of the best of 2008 already.<br /><br />This isn't your typical superhero movie, its better than that.  For the most part I didn't feel like I was sitting through a typical superhero film.  There is almost a realistic feel throughout this film unlike some superhero films (but don't expect things to be believable sometimes).  Details are laid out on how everything is built and works.  There is a definite maturity within the storyline and actors.  In fact, the top four actors in the film have all had some big awards in their past.<br /><br />There are two parts of Iron Man.  First you've got the Afghanistan storyline and the Obadiah Stane story (Jeff Bridges) who turns out to be the movie bad guy (and gives Iron Man one heck of a fight in the end).  The creators have done away with the outdated evets on how Iron Man came to be in the comic books, and placed the film in a touchy present day situation, placing Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) as a captive within Afghanistan.  This has a huge impact on Stark's life and the man he will become throughout the film (not just the superhero he becomes, but the person he becomes too).  Obadiah doesn't like it and next thing you know we got quite a villain to deal with.<br /><br />The visual effetcs were provided by Industrial Light & Magic and the sound by Skywalker Sound, in other words you can expect incredible effects that don't dissapoint.  Accompany that with great comic relief, great actors and characters, and an impressive story and you got one film you can't miss out on.<br /><br />And as a bonus, this is just the beginning.  Iron Man 2 is already in works.  Though I missed it in the theatre, a glimpse of Captain America' shield can be seen in Tony's lab.  And don't forget to watch the new Hulk film this June (ditch the old one with Eric Bana).  There is to be a Robert Downey Jr. cameo in that film...something is happening with Marvel.  Oh yeah, and don't miss the end of Iron Man, like after credits end.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5"
"result.9","If Superman has Lex Luthor and Spider-Man has Dr. Octopus and Batman has the Joker, who exactly is Iron Man's archenemy? He may engage in ferocious battle with an equally ironclad baddie near the end of the film, but I'm going to go in a much more existential direction and say that his greatest enemy is himself. In Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man,"" billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) eventually realizes that the ultra high tech weapons he designed have done much more harm than good, so in a way, the climactic fight scene at the end was his own doing. What a perfect display of irony, especially for a superhero trying to free himself of his infamous reputation as a war-mongering mass murderer. Where exactly is the line drawn? At what point can weapons of mass destruction ever be considered a path to peace?<br /><br />You don't normally associate moral dilemmas of this magnitude with a comic book adaptation. The thing is, the idea of a suited man fighting against an adversary plotting to take over the world is not lost in ""Iron Man""--it just takes on a much different form. In this case the adversaries are war and injustice, both of which shake their threatening fists at the world every hour of every day. What is lost in ""Iron Man"" is the idea that a superhero has to be a perfect, emotionless drone that tirelessly fights for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Even with his money, his brilliance, and his specially designed suit, Stark is about as flawed as the average Joe walking down the street. He's stubborn, cocky, just a smidge arrogant, and after being held captive in Afghanistan for three months, he's far too willing place himself in scenarios he may not be ready for.<br /><br />Before being held captive, Stark was a smooth-talking businessman that designed the most advanced weapons the American military has ever seen. While in Afghanistan introducing a new missile-launcher called the Jericho, he's attacked and kidnapped by a militant group of Afghani extremists. They demand that he manufacture the Jericho for them, and since they somehow have gained access to many of his weapons, this shouldn't be too difficult. But even with a metal device implanted in his chest (supposedly to keep the shrapnel in his body from reaching his heart), he refuses to be under their control; with the help of an Afghani scientist (Shaun Toub), Stark secretly builds a prototype metal suit that can throw flames and shoot bullets and protect him from enemy fire. An elaborate escape scene leads to his rescue, which paves the way for a hilarious moment back in Los Angeles: as he sits in a limo refusing medical treatment, he demands that someone get him an American cheeseburger.<br /><br />Stark's experience triggers a newfound sense of responsibility, one that inspires him to shut down the weapons division of his company and focus on more humanitarian uses for technology. His colleague--Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges)--doesn't go along with this for reasons that are expected in comic book adaptations, such as being power-hungry. This doesn't stop Stark, who begins redesigning his metal suit in the comfort of his luxurious, technologically advanced Malibu estate. After installing a few upgrades, like rocket boosters and missile launchers, he tests his new red and gold suit by flying back to Afghanistan and attacking the same militant group that kidnapped him. How convenient that he happens to arrive just as they're raiding a village and taking civilians captive; superheroes save the day strictly because of convenient plot devices, and that's one of the reasons why we like these movies so much.<br /><br />With the help of his personal assistant, the anxious but highly capable Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his friend, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark spends the rest of the film trying to put an end to his past reputation, first by finding out how the Afghanis received crates of his weapons, second by battling against Stane, who has let his position in the company get the better of him. Yes, it's all enhanced by a wealth of impressive special effects, but that's not the point: Stark is introduced as a man who has everything while at the same time having nothing, and most of this stems from his unwillingness to acknowledge his effect on the world--he essentially got rich making and selling weapons, devices that kill and maim. Now that he's seen the error of his ways, he wants to redeem himself by fighting against the monster of his own creation. He does this all while maintaining a smug yet charming attitude, which is good because a superhero should be allowed to have a little personality.<br /><br />Even better than that is not hiding that personality behind an alter ego, one that behaves as an obvious polar opposite to the hero. This story may be pure comic book fantasy, but Tony Stark brings a realism to it that's refreshing, more so than anything ever seen from Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne combined. It's essentially because of him that ""Iron Man"" transcends anything I've previously expected from a comic book adaptation. He says at a press conference that he's not the superhero type, and that's really funny because I thought the same thing about Robert Downey, Jr. when I saw the first ads for ""Iron Man""; at the time, it seemed unlikely that he would be the type to fly alongside jetfighters or to shoot highly explosive missiles at tanks. But it's obvious now--he was exactly what was needed to realize the reworked idea of hero versus enemy. A lot of cool digital effects weren't a bad touch, either."
"result.10","Marvel Comics, unhappy with the lack of creative control and its share of profits in the films made by other studios based on their characters, recently started their own film division. The first film from this endeavor, ""Iron Man"" starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard, is a lot of fun, and sure to generate a number of sequels based on the huge amount of money made on opening weekend. This is good for Marvel Films because they will need to use some of the profits from this film to offset the inevitable loss for their next film, ""The Incredible Hulk"" starring Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, due later this summer. Watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />But I digress. ""Iron Man"".<br /><br />Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) is a brilliant man who grew up in his father's shadow, an inventor, Starks Sr. & Jr. both learn they can make any of their ideas a reality Sr. was one of the people who helped build the Atomic bomb, so it probably comes as no surprise that Stark Industries sells weapons; weapons of every size, shape and megaton. When Tony comes of age, he takes over the company from his father's right hand man, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the two work together, as a team - Stark handles the inventions, Obadiah handles the business side of things. Stark takes a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, a huge missile and bomb combo designed to level mountain ranges. Driving back, his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. During the attack, Tony is injured and a fellow prisoner fits him with a magnet saving his life. When Tony wakes up, he learns his captors want him to recreate the weapon he just demonstrated, for their use. But he comes up with a better idea and creates a new power supply for the magnet, allowing him to move without a car battery at his side. He then uses a list of equipment procured from his captors to create an iron suit, complete with weapons, to wear and escape captivity. When he returns home, he realizes he can improve the suit, its powers and its abilities. Now that Tony has seen his products create death, mayhem and damage, he wants to do some good in the world. Naturally, Obadiah is a little disappointed to learn of the companies new, less profitable business plan. But Colonel Rhodes (Terence Howard) is happy to see the change is his longtime business associate and friend. And Stark's personal assistant, Pepper Pots (Paltrow) is also a little more attracted to her boss. After a test run of his new, sleeker, more powerful suit, Stark realizes he left some unfinished business behind in Afghanistan. Then, some trouble begins to brew back home.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau (""Elf"", ""Zathura"" and an actor with many credits) combines unconventional casting choices, very good acting, an intelligent screenplay and some kick a** special effects to create an enjoyable movie going experience and a great kick off to the summer season. This is one of those occasions when you can almost anticipate the sequel, when you can't wait for it. Now that they have all of the exposition concerning the creation of the superhero out of the way, the sequel can get down to business and throw us directly into the story, keeping us on the edge of our seats. I am an eternal optimist.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is a lot of fun and more intelligent than you might expect. Robert Downey, Jr. seems like an unconventional choice to play a superhero, and he is, but he is actually the perfect choice for the role of Tony Stark. A rich, highly intelligent industrialist, Tony works hard, spending a lot of time and money coming up with new ideas and inventions, making them work, making his company all the more rich and powerful. But he also plays hard. Living in a fancy, modern house on a hill overlooking the ocean in Malibu, Tony has state of the art everything in his house, allowing him to spend as much time as possible working and playing. He is also a lothario, sleeping with and hitting on as many women as he possibly can. He picks up a reporter in Vegas and the next morning, in his house in Malibu, she is awakened by the house `opening' the curtains to his bedroom, his assistant, Pepper, holding her dry-cleaning. Tony also has an advanced computer system, helping him and allowing him to run with ideas and to continue to develop them. This system allows him to view 3-D holographic depictions of his ideas, removing and adding pieces at will.<br /><br />As we get to know Tony, we realize he lives a secluded life. Allowed to work and play, as he wants, he knows little of the effects of his work on the real world, and leaves the running of his business to Obadiah. When he travels to Afghanistan, his eyes begin to open as he witnesses firsthand what his work actually does, the consequences of his life, and sees a little window through which he can move to start making a positive impact on the world. But this change in his life doesn't please everyone and provides Iron Man with a formidable foe, the Iron Monger.<br /><br />When Stark is taken prisoner in Afghanistan, he uses all of his previous research and designs to build a new and improved power supply to help keep him alive. And he also creates a prototype of Iron Man, allowing his escape from the men who so desperately want him to create a new weapon for them. This is a great illustration of the character's intelligence and cunning, making all of the previous information about him we have been bombarded with seem very real.<br /><br />Downey, Jr. uses his well-known sarcastic attitude and delivery to bring life to Stark's sheltered persona. Because he lives in a cocoon, and has a lot of money, he doesn't realize how the real world works where he lives and plays as he pleases. This same persona also helps the character bring humor to the proceedings and make the story all the more memorable. He proves to be an excellent choice for the role and his career will definitely benefit from the success of this film and it's inevitable sequels.<br /><br />Favreau and his team have created a rich, decadent playground for Stark to live in. His computer system uses advanced holographs and voice commands, he drives the best, fastest cars and his house is run by a computer system that recognizes Tony and Pepper, and addresses them by name. But more importantly, Favreau has assembled a cast that can act, a group of actors more commonly associated with Academy Award nominated and critically praised films. These actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots and she is, by far, the weakest of the supporting characters. There is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at Walt Disney Concert Hall. But Paltrow is wasted in the role. While she does bring a memorable respectability to the role, making it better, her skills weren't needed for Pepper Pots. When she becomes endangered (which is inevitable, face it), she doesn't stand around shrieking, but she doesn't prove to be extremely strong either. And the flirtatious relationship between Tony and Pepper is generally ignored with the exception of the one scene mentioned earlier and a few passing references. Hopefully, this area will be expanded and improved upon in the next installment.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's father's business partner who helps run the company until Tony becomes old enough to take the reins. Tony continues to work with Obadiah, leaving the day to day operations in his hands, freeing him up to work on his creations. Obadiah is a very smart man and makes the company very profitable. Naturally, he feels threatened by Tony's change in attitude and works behind the scenes to ensure the company will remain as profitable as ever. He also steals Tony's plans and begins work on his own version of Iron Man, seeing the potential in such a lethal weapon. Obadiah has spent his adult life selling weapons, becoming rich as a result. So in his mind, lethal is good.<br /><br />Obadiah is a lot more twisted and crooked than I am letting on, but discovering the extent of this is half the fun.<br /><br />Terrence Howard plays Colonel Jim Rhodes, a longtime associate of Tony, who acts as a liaison between Stark and his government contacts. When Stark is taken hostage, Rhodes leads the rescue mission. When Stark becomes Iron Man, Rhodes helps him out in various ways.<br /><br />As you watch the story unfold, you get the sense Howard, like everyone else in the film, is having a fun time. He plays the role with a certain sense of tongue-in-cheek but this quality is played subtlety, which makes the role all the more appealing and real.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is a very good, very enjoyable, fun summer film. The actors have a lot of fun and it translates to the screen. The performances, in combination with a well-written screenplay, great special effects and a believable universe help to make ""Iron Man"" one of the more memorable summer films in many years. I can easily see this character becoming a franchise to challenge ""Spiderman"" in popularity."
"result.1","I'm a fan of comic book adaptations but i have to say Iron Man just did not do it for me. I felt that nothing new was added to the comic book adaptation genre, not in plot, screen writing or even special effects. It looked to me like it has all been done and seen before. I did not quite understand what all the hype surrounding this movie was about Robert Downey Jr. was not very convincing as a good guy i liked him better when he was selling weapons and couldn't care less about anyone else, his good side felt to me as somewhat forced on him, didn't believe it. Although i love Gwyneth Paltrow i hated this part for her, it was just meaningless and very secondary, any up and coming actress could have done that role. Paltrow should have never agreed to it.<br />All in all i do not think this movie has what it takes to be on the top ten list of best comic book adaptations."
"result.2","Being Marvel Studios' first self-financed film, Iron Man is a pure treat from start to finish.  I won't bother going into the storyline, since most already know it by now considering how smashing a success the film proved to be at the box-office, but it does go without saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel film to see the light of day, outshined only by X2: X-Men United.  Robert Downey Jr is perfectly cast as billionaire industrialist and weapons developer Tony Stark, and Jon Favreau is definitely the right man for the job in helming the film.  It's perfectly paced and pays wonderous homages to the classic comics that it's adapted from, all the while featuring an ending that have you simply salivating for what's to come not only in the realm of Iron Man, but of Marvel as a whole.  As a superhero film, Iron Man is definitely close to the top (but nowhere near The Dark Knight, which takes the notion of the superhero movie and turns it on it's head), with the only drawback for me personally being that I just couldn't get into Terrence Howard as James Rhodes.  I don't know what it is, I jsut don't find him all that well-casted as Rhodes as I do everyone else in the film.  Still though, Iron Man is a pure blast for nearly it's entire running time, and here's hoping that Favreau, Downey, and co. can keep the magic coming."

"result.4","You don't need to be a Marvel fan or even a comic fan at all in order to appreciate the exiting adventure that is Iron Man. It's got the excitement, danger, and the touch of romance that represents the ""good movie"", all with a lead actor that knows what he's doing.<br /><br />But the best part about Iron Man, I observed while watching for the second time, is not even the action or the overall plot of the movie, as phenomenal as they are. For me, there's nothing better in the world than a main character that undergoes genuine change, a character you actually care about through and through! Tony Stark is as well-rounded a character as can be, one moment making you laugh and another bringing tears to your eyes through his self realizations, risks, and of course his banter with his personal assistant, the ""famous"" Pepper Pots.<br /><br />So, in summary, if you want to watch a movie where you actually care about the characters and the plot resolution, Iron Man is your best bet."
"result.5","Standards have been rising in the comic adaptation genre, and the new Iron Man comes in at the top of the range. This is one of the best comic adaptations ever, and a very good action flick in itself. It gets the summer movie season off to a flying start - if the rest of the season's movies rise to this level, it's going to be a great year.<br /><br />Effects are everythig you could ask, with lots of explosions, fire, and other good enterainment - but that's the norm these days. Plenty sets this apart from the pack. Acting is way up there, as the star-laden cast would have you expect. Scripting offers a blend of humor, action, sneering bad guys, and simmering romance that's hard to beat. It gives Robert Downey Jr. lots to work with, including an outstanding aide in the form (the lovely form) of Paltrow's ""Pepper Potts."" The main bad guys are the current evil-du-jour, mideastern madmen - so recognizable that they don't even need motives. Heck, even the industrial robots have more personality than the entire casts of some comic flicks.<br /><br />One of the most implausible of plot turns really brought this to life for me: Stark's sudden rethinking of the multi-generation arms business. As an engineer and as one who's tried (not always successfully) to keep my work out of weapons, that exerted more of a pull than there was any rational reason to expect. But that's way too serious for this movie. Even if it jumps the season by a few weeks, it's great summer fun.<br /><br />-- wiredweird"
"result.6","I'd advise keeping the plastic box it comes in. The insert is removable, with artwork on the inside -- nothing too extravagant, just a frontal shot of the Mark 3 suit. The mask alone won't really work if you tried to put it on a shelf with normal DVD's. It's about the width of two normal DVD cases, a little larger. If you keep the clear plastic box it comes with, you could easily display it alongside the rest of your DVD collection. Or, if you so wished, I'm sure you could figure out a way to hang the mask on a wall for display."
"result.7","Director Jon Favreau (Zathura & Elf) brings Marvel Comics' armored superhero to the big screen in the first-rate comic book adventure ""Iron Man"". While demonstrating his company's newest weapon system, billionaire industrialist and genius inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by Middle Eastern terrorists and forced to build a powerful weapon. Instead, Stark secretly develops a suit of armor to escape his captives. Upon returning to the United States, a renewed Tony Stark is determined to amend his company's mistakes and improves his armor to become the high-tech superhero Iron Man. ""Iron Man"" is a superb crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster that ranks as one of the best superhero movies to date. The latest comic book adaptation delivers a well-paced storyline, excellent visual effects, good action sequences, a solid cast and great humor. Downey's entertaining performance as Tony Stark is one of the movie's biggest strengths. ""Iron Man"" also stars Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Academy Award-winner Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" arrives on Blu-Ray with a fully loaded 2-disc Ultimate Edition that's a must-have for any Marvel Comics fan. The 2008 blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is very impressive but not quite perfect. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio is excellent. ""Iron Man"" Ultimate Edition features two great documentaries: ""I Am Iron Man"" that offers an in-depth behind-the-scenes look in the development of the film, and ""The Invincible Iron Man"" that explores the origins of the Marvel Comics' character. Other bonus materials include four picture galleries, 11 deleted and extended scenes, theatrical trailers, ""The Onion: Iron Man Trailer"" gag short, actor Robert Downey Jr's screen test and ""Hall of Armor"" interactive feature. Overall, ""Iron Man"" Ultimate Edition scores an ""A""."
"result.8","In a decade of interchangable superhero movies desperately trying to enter the Superhero Pantheon, Iron Man is the only one that succeeds in breaking the wanna-be mold and becomes truly fresh and worthwhile. It mixes just the right amount of real world injustice and superhero magic.<br /><br />The movie never takes itself to seriously and so never becomes too heavy handed or bogged down in psychology. It never becomes too slapstick, and Downey Jr.'s remarkable performance brings to life both the bitterness that makes Tony Stark a believable human being and the fortitude that leads him to make himself into Iron Man.<br /><br />Stark doesn't care what anyone thinks of him; he's a playboy/weapons mogul who fights injustice because it offends him personally and follows the rules of no other superhero code. Iron Man, too, follows the rules of no other superhero movie; it leaves the impression that the filmmakers did it solely to please themselves, disregarding what the studio or fanboy expect and ""Iron Man movie"" to be.<br /><br />And that's what makes it great. Now if only they could continue to ignore precedent and continue the stellar work in the inevitable sequel."
"result.9","Just watched Iron Man Blu-ray edition, and it is fantastic. Disc one had a problem loading yesterday, but it was due to a server problem as the disc tried to access BD live. Paramount corrected the situation, and the disc plays perfect now. If your disc is taking long to load...If you have your PS3 settings set to automatically connect to the internet for BD-Live content, then the 'Iron Man' BD does that first thing. It takes about 5 minutes to download and initialize that feature. Just let the disc load once and it will load quickly everytime afterwards. Or, you can turn off the automatic internet feature under your XMB BD settings.<br /><br />When I was watching my BD for the first time, I went through the same thing. Anyway, I wonder if the startup time is just different for everyone because of a hit on their servers or something. If they are downloading stuff for BD-Live at the beginning like we are speculating, then maybe a lot of people just getting home from school or off work are trying it now so the downloading is taking a lot longer.<br /><br />Fantastic reference type Blu-ray. Highly recommended."
"result.10","Marvel Comics, like it's counterpart nemesis DC, has had it's share of hits and misses when it comes to translating it's superhero catalog to the big screen. While successes like Spider-Man and XMen tore it's way to the top with ease, there's also the ones that got clobbered like The Punisher and the first attempt at Hulk in 2003. But with CGI technology reaching closer heights than ever before, now Hollywood has the ability to truly turn those ink and color panels to life, and no opportunity has been better received than with Iron Man.<br /><br />Tony Stark is basically a war profiteer that he and his company Stark Industries creates and manufacturers weapons so the good ole USA can win in a variety of battles, and in these reflective times, the battle currently is in the Middle East. When he himself is captured during a weapons demonstration that leaves numerous deadly pieces of shrapnel permanently close to his heart, he and a fellow scientific prisoner implant a device in his chest to keep them from reaching that area & in return becomes a major power source. When the captors want Stark to create an ultimate bomb, Stark turns the tables and creates a bodysuit of armor to escape and in return he realizes that he cannot go on in building weapons that usually just falls in the wrong hands, and unknowingly to Stark, by his business partner whose only concern is the almighty dollar and Tony's demise. So with his new and improved version of the suit that helped his escape, he's gonna beat them at their own game and find his superhero within.<br /><br />Let's state one thing:this is a GREAT cast. Robert Downey Jr not only looks the part of Tony Stark, but with his natural ego-driven comicial flair, he was born to play this role. Even the supporting cast of Jeff Bridges (who with his shaven head & beard might be hard to recognize), Terrence Howard, and a surprisingly Gwyneth Paltrow, who you'd figure would do a role like this in the early stages of her career not the opposite, bring the story along with a great pace. There's really not a weak link in the bunch. As for the CGI effects, of which most times I personally dread, they come off very natural and believable here. Where as in 2008's The Incredible Hulk when the lead character was of organic origin, Iron Man is pure solid-looking steel and because of that fact can be replicated much better without any doubt if the object is really on the screen or not. Visually all parties pulled off an amazing feat with Iron Man and honestly without flesh and blood to get in the way, the CGI does what at this point it can truly do best.<br /><br />Even though this review is for the single-disc edition, Paramount still gives you quite a value here than just a typical bare-bones disc. With a film presentation that has one of the best looking and sounding standard definition combos I've ever seen, they also include on it over twenty-four minutes of extended & deleted scenes which at least half of are worthy of a director's cut. There's even an Easter Egg hidden here maybe giving you a preview of what extras the 2 discer might have in store for you. So for fans on a limited income, or those that just want the movie, you won't go wrong by buying the smaller content version. While a commentary by Downey would have been nice (neither version has one), there still is plenty to enjoy with this presentation.<br /><br />Overall this was a great origin superhero film that didn't drag one bit within it's 2 hours and 2 minutes. Great cast, great story, and a bonus ending scene (featuring a surprising cameo) that will make you demand more in the near future. And unlike The Dark Knight, that took itself way too seriously, Iron Man still mentions problematic issues concerning war today and thrilling us all along the way.<br /><br />P.S.: The two-disc version has extensive behind the scenes and interviews with the film's cast and crew that in my opinion could have brought my rating a good half point or more if that was the version I chose to see as of this writing.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)"

"result.3","What makes Iron Man a great movie is that it is virtually void of those moments where you go, ""That could never happen."" And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an ""iron"" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but also gives Tony Stark the ability to fly.<br /><br />I've seen comparisons between the detail and...well...just plain awesomeness that was abundant in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC6A3E/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Batman Begins</a> and Iron Man. And that comparison would not be incorrect. While I'd agree that both had great action and made viewers believe that these superheros actually existed, Batman Begins was more dark while Iron Man kept you giggling at Tony Stark's wise-guy personality...which is true to the comic book versions of the characters.<br /><br />And who better to be in the role of a wise-guy than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark! And the rest of the cast and acting in the movie were terrific.<br /><br />Iron Man takes you from Stark's creation of the gold-titanium-alloy suit to his confrontation with those that would see Stark Industries commit treason. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing will probably put Jon Favreau in the sought-after category.<br /><br />The good news is that Iron Man will be back, but in what capacity is the question. It's well known that Stark (Downey, Jr) has a cameo in 2008's The Incredible Hulk. And it's rumored that the actors in Iron Man have all signed on for two sequels (at the time of this writing Director Favreau has not). But will Iron Man's return be solo, or perhaps with some of his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785110828/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Avenging</a> buddies? Either way...I can't wait.<br /><br />I will definitely pick up Iron Man for my collection. I don't know about the theaters in your area, but the theaters in mine don't even come close to the picture and sound quality that I get from my home theater. I'm not bragging; I'm just saying that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168ML1G/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Iron Man</a> will be a movie that goes into my Blu Ray player the day it's released."
"result.4","Now here's one for the collection.  Robert Downey Jr. shines, and is perfect for the role of Tony Stark.  Robert Downey Jr. has been around for some time, but this movie has catapulted him into superstardom.<br /><br />I am a big fan of superhero movies, and strongly believe that this one delivered.  I am looking forward to owning it on DVD.  There was really nothing to complain about for me.  It was really tight.  No plot holes, no cheesy moments, no cgi flaws, everything was there and in perfect proportion throughout.  Had they tried to pull off this movie decades ago, it may have fallen short, but modern special effects are at work here, and the designers do quite a fine job with this film.  Notable is the amazing detail on the intricate body armor and electronic systems of the suit.  You really believe that the suit (Stark's invention) is formidable and ultra high tech.  There is plenty of action, and some unbelievably cool moments that will have you hitting the rewind button, or watching the whole movie again soon.  I give it a full five stars.  Enjoy!"
"result.5","When Marvel and Paramount first started promoting ""Iron Man,"" I expected it to be nothing more than CGI sequence after CGI sequence showing you just how far FX have come.  With Black Sabbath's song of the same name pumping up the viewer, it looked like just another empty action film.  Wow, what a nice surprise to walk out of the theater feeling as if I'd just witnessed a solid drama interspersed with excellent FX and action sequences.  Robert Downey, Jr. makes the lead role of Tony Stark/Iron Man his own.  Much like Michael Keaton when he suited up as Batman, I admit that I had my doubts when it was revealed that Downey, Jr. would head up this film.  Instead, Tony Stark comes across as one of the most believable characters to grace a comic book film adaptation.  He's a jerk, highly intelligent and self-centered.  When a life-changing (and almost life-taking) incident occurs, he returns to his home as a new man hoping to right the wrongs that his company has done for so many years.  Being a comic book film, naturally, a villain steps up to put a stop to Stark for both financial and egotistical gains.  The result is an all-out slugfest sure to please even the harshest critic.<br /><br />The cast is solid, from Terrence Howard as Rhodes to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.  Jeff Bridges gives an excellent performance as Obadiah Stane, Stark's primary business associate in the weapons business.<br /><br />The actual suit(s) that make up Iron Man and his enemy look great on the screen.  The action sequences are brilliant, especially one involving civilian traffic.  Another highlight is Stark's home, which gives the Batcave a run for its money as far as gadgets go.<br /><br />Even though the FX are notched up quite a bit, they take a step back to the plot.  This is one of the most character-driven comic adaptations to hit the screen in a long time.  Perhaps it's the quality of the cast or the direction of Jon Favreau or a combination of both, but this story just doesn't feel like an ordinary comic book film.  The story is interesting, funny at just the right times, and never falls back on action or FX to bail out a scene.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is a very, very good film.  It's a comic book adaptation that doesn't feel or act like a comic book adaptation.  Despite the bright red and gold armor, you'll find yourself more concerned with the man inside of the suit.  That makes a good film in my book.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is necessary.  There's a tad bit of language and one swift roll in the hay between two characters.  The action is explosive, literally, and some younger kids may be put off by a few of the deaths in the film.  If you do have younger children who want to see this film (and I'm sure there are plenty), I think that a nine or ten year-old could view this with a little guidance from mom and dad.<br /><br />Highly recommended and hopefully a sign of things to come this summer film season.  Also, like everybody else seems to be warning, make sure to sit through the entire credits for a brief hint at ""Iron Man 2"" or perhaps an entirely new film that'll make fanboys jump with glee."
"result.6","Cool. That is one word that describes this movie. Exciting and fun are another two. Robert Downey Jr. was nothing but excellent at playing Iron Man. He exhibited wit, intelligence, that playboy charm and charisma: the works for a superhero. Although the plot was not strong, and there were a few holes or weak areas, the movie was excellent. But, the plot did not matter that much. This is an origin story and it was all about the characters, they are the ones that move the story forward.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was one cold blooded arms dealer, and he was great at it. I just wish we would have seen more of him. Terrence Howard was ok, not the best part of the movie. Paltrow was cute in her very capable performance. But the story centered around Tony Stark and Iron Man, and it was good. The action sequences and the special effects were excellent but did not dominate the film, which I was grateful form.<br /><br />This movie managed what many movies have not been able to do: balance. The action and special effects are enough to keep the movie going and highly entertaining, but the character development is what drives it forward, what gives it form and meaning. This movie is a must see, it is fun, funny as well, and has excellent performances."
"result.7","I believe one of the best things to happen to the big screen was when they started filming Marvel Comics. Honestly, I'll go see an action-adventure or science fiction fantasy film on the big screen over any other genre. And the Marvel classics translate very well to film, particularly if you have a writer like Peter David doing the novelization.<br /><br />The story in brief:  when Star Industries CEO and wunderkind engineer Tony Stark (Downey, Jr) is kidnapped by terrorists, he builds an Iron Man suit to escape rather than creating the missile they demanded.<br /><br />Back at home, he decides to convert Stark into a more politically correct company and 'make peace instead of war.'  He hadn't reckoned with the terrorists re-arming and deceit from his own camp.<br /><br />The acting's great. I think Terrence Howard (Colonel Rhodes) is going to be the next Denzel Washington.  He's a good actor and easy on the eyes. Jeff Bridges broke out of type and served as a pretty amazing Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />The imagery is fabulous. Scenes from Stark's capture were gripping.  His fellow captive, Yinsen (played by Shaun Toub) was an interesting and sad character, such a waste of a brilliant man.<br /><br />The soundtrack is particularly good with strong, evocative musical images. Okay, I wish they'd used Black Sabbath's version of ""Iron Man"" for the soundtrack, but that's already been used by both ""Detroit Rock City"" and ""Lords of Dogtown.""<br /><br />Best of all, for a vertigo sufferer like me, there was minimal monkey cam.  I could follow almost all the action without a problem.  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ""Iron Man"" and may well see the film again before it leaves the big screen."

During one day in Afghanistan, he demonstrates for a group of U.S. soldiers a different kind of weapon that works successfully and gets kidnapped by terrorists as he's held captive and forced to make the weapons for them. Instead he uses his brilliant brains and creates a special armour-suit that helps him escape from hell and is sent back to the U.S., of course his friend Obadia (Jeff Bridges) wants to take over the corporation for himself and makes a deadly conspiracy. Thus Stark creates a more advanced, industructable and more powerful suit that makes him into ""Iron Man"" in which he serves to protect the innocent and fight evil.<br /><br />Intelligent, exciting and thrilling sci-fi actioner is based on a Marvel Comic Book and is the first great comic book movie of the year next to ""Dark Knight"". Gwyneth Palthrow co-stars as Stark's sexy secretary Pepper Potts and Terrence Howard as Colnel Rhodes, it's the greatest Marvel Movie since ""X2"" or ""Spider-Man 2"". Downy Jr. definitely nailed the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man well just like Christopher Reeve was to Superman, Tobey Mcguire to Spider-Man and Christian Bale was to Batman. Jeff Bridges made a belivable and excellent villain here in this motion picture, the special effects by ILM and Stan Winston are just outstanding including the acting. It stays true to the origins of the comic books even though a little of the origin is changed to a modern time, it's a truly satisfying and smart superhero movie that knows how to please the audience and critics alike thanks to the magic of it's smart script, great acting and fantastic action sequences with a nifty suprise at the end of the credits of this movie.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray is mindblowingly fantastic with it's nicely detailed picture and sound that will blow you away.

"result.9","Iron Man was a huge surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. Going into the summer of 2008, my attention was completely preoccupied with The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk, Kung Fu Panda, Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, Indiana Jones 4, Wanted, Hellboy II, Wall-E, Step Brothers and The Mummy 3. All of which were very hyped up titles that had people lining up for them. But, among them was one of the best comic book movies ever made. As much as I love The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder (they're in my top three favorite all-time movies), I think that Iron Man is superior to both of them in some ways. It is highly entertaining all the way through. It doesn't matter if you like Superheroes, or not. There is something in this film for just about everyone. The few action scenes are top notch. My personal favorite is the scene when Iron Man returns to the Middle East to destroy all of his weapons. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. was beyond perfect as Tony Stark. I am always glad to see A-listers give their all in these types of films because it proves that they are not just for children and geeks (honestly, we all still have a little of both in us). The rest of the amazing cast consists of Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and even Samuel L. Jackson in a surprise post-credits cameo. I also have to mention the director, Jon Favreau. I only knew him from comedies and tv, but he did a great job with this big blockbuster.<br /><br />Despite the great action, direction , and superb casting, the real key to this movie's excellence is the script. The writing is not quite as deep and dark as The Dark Knight, but for a supposedly ""summer popcorn action flick"", it is right on par. It never hurts to get a team of actual comic book writers along with the creator himself, Stan The Man, to guide you and tell you what fits, and what doesn't. That is the only way to make a comic book character come to life, just as he is on the pages. And in the end it will always pay off with the most important group in the audience, the fans. I cannot say that without admitting something though. I was never an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, although he does make an appearance in alot of my books. But I am very familiar with the character, not only from my comics that he is in, but also the cartoon from the 90's. I still try to catch episodes of the cartoon to this day. The reason I never got into his comic arc is because, I honestly had no interest in the villains he fought, except for the Hulk. Most of his villains were just big robots and monsters (Godzilla was actually one of them). With that said, I was still happy to see that they chose a very conventional first villain, Iron Monger. As long as they never make a movie with M.O.D.O.K., I will be happy.<br /><br />My only complaint about this movie is how scarce the action is. There are only really three scenes of action in total. I know it may seem a little hypocritical for me to complain about the action in Iron Man and give it a 90%, when I gave The Dark Knight 100%, and it had even less action than Iron Man. But the difference between the two is that Iron Man is an action movie, but in my opinion, The Dark Knight is a drama. Alot of people would probably disagree with that statement, but after watching both films many many times, that's the feeling I get about them. The action scenes that it does have are beautiful though. I just think Jon Favreau is not an action director, so he played it safe. In the end, that may have been why Iron Man was so great. I was just really surprised that Iron Man became one of my favorite movies. It reminds me of how I felt about Star Trek. I had my doubts, but those doubts were completely shattered after seeing it.<br /><br />I'll keep this very short because I cannot pretend to be a pro. As far as I can tell, the Picture Quality is reference material through and through. Grain is persistent thoughout, but that only means that they didn't scrub this beautiful transfer clean (which would have taken details away along with the grain). The beautiful effects by ILM are on full display, and i saw no obvious flaws. The same can be said for the audio too. I'm working with a very modest Home Theatre, but I can tell the difference between a good and poor soundtrack. I couldn't hear any apparent flaws. Fine work. As far as the Special Features fo, I loved them. Plain and simple. I just wish there was a damn audio commentary. Commentaries are essential to me, and I cannot help but dock the extras a whole point for there not being one. The one that Favreau did for Iron Man 2 was exactly what we want in a commentary, so it was a missed opportunity. Otherwise, the extras were brilliant.<br /><br />8.5/10"
"result.10","Overall, Iron Man is the best two-disc package available on Blu-ray. The film is fun, the audio is mighty impressive and I can't in good conscience fault the video quality enough to deduct points. It may not be the most detailed picture I've ever seen, but I believe that could easily be accounted for by the camera work and CGI integration. Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job and the special effects give Iron Man a fresh, unique vibe that sets it apart from most action or superhero films. There are enough surprises and plot twists to keep any audience on their toes; enough humor to keep any audience laughing; enough character development to satisfy the critics and stark nerds; and enough effects and action to get the adrenalin rush thru our bodies. Iron Man gets my highest recommendation on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Now this is what you get for the BD version:<br /><br />Blu-ray Disc 1:<br /><br />Hall of Armor<br />The Invincible Iron Man Origins<br />Friends & Foes<br />The Definitive Iron Man<br />Demon in a Bottle<br />Extremis and Beyond<br />Ultimate Iron Man<br />Deleted/Extended Scenes<br />BD Live: Iron Man IQ<br /><br />Blu-ray Disc 2:<br /><br />I Am Iron Man The Journey Begins<br />The Suit that makes the Iron Man<br />The Walk of Destruction<br />Grounded In Reality<br />Beneath the Armor<br />It's All in the Details<br />A Good Story, Well Told<br />Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man<br />Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test<br />The Actor's Process (scene rehearsal with cast)<br />The Onion ""Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into Full Length Film""<br />Theatrical Trailers<br />Image Galleries<br /><br />Overall 10 out of 10, this is how a superhero movie gets done and how a BD is made."
"result.1","When I first saw the previews of this movie I was a skeptic.  Iron Man was not a household name like Batman or Superman and to be honest I knew very little about the character.  Some might even say he was a ""B List"" Super Hero as his own adventures never took off very well and he tended to be bundled with other heroes instead of having a long running series of his own.<br /><br />However this movie just blows those notion away and if they keep at it not only will this be a great franchise for future movies but my guess it will re-kindle the comic book market for this hero as well.<br /><br />The studio could have taken the easy way out and done this movie as a cheesy action movie with a thin plot which would make for a great summer blockbuster but be easy to be forgotten over time.  Instead they went all out with a rock solid plot that is real, gritty, and believable.  There is a movie here with action, and not just a bunch of action scenes made into a movie (ie Transformers).<br /><br />The casting was right on and the actors did a great job bringing the characters to life.  Downey just nails the part in every way.  I have never been a fan of his actually as he has always irritated me but he has redeemed himself in Iron Man and I totally rooted for his character.  Everyone else from major parts to even the smaller parts did a wonderful job.<br /><br />The art work and effects were also just amazing.  The attention to detail just blows my mind.  The suit in particular and how he puts it on made perfect sense and it was great to share the joy of his discoveries with Iron Man.  A lot of movies skip this part and show something bad happening to the main character and then a short 'build sceen' that makes no sense and then they emerge all decked out.  The older Batman movies come to mind where he has all this super tech but no way to explain any of it.  Iron Man explains it so it makes sense and takes you on the journey to building it all and testing through the kinks of the system and its limitations.<br /><br />Being that this movie was so wonderful with such great special effects and attention to detail, I ended up 'upgrading' to the Blu Ray version.  The Blu Ray difference stuck out soooo much on this already good looking movie.  The level of detail on the suit in particular just made me constantly say ""WOW'.  The Blu Ray brought this movie to the next level with sight and sounds along with having a ton of great extra features that my DVD did not have.<br /><br />In the end I highly recommend this movie to anyone as it is one of my favorite movies now."
"result.2","So first we had X-men, then Spiderman and afterwards other countless Marvel Comic adaptations that were either majorly or moderately successful. But what do we have to expect for Iron Man, does it live up to the expectations of the fans, does it match up Spidey or X-men? Honestly it does; this adaptation proves that the comic book genre can still bring a character from the pages of a comic and yet maintain it fresh and new to a vast broad audience.<br /><br />In this first and clever adaptation of ""Iron Man"" we have Tony Stark, A genius and ambitious weapons business man who finds himself after being captured by Terrorist. These terrorist have weapons built and designed by Stark; they need Stark's help to build a super intelligent missile known as ""the Jericho"". In his attempt to create this weapon Stark creates a better and more efficient weapon...obviously Iron Man.<br /><br />The movie is a popcorn flick above all, it does however mange to create a very well crafted origin storyline; maybe not on the level of Batman Begins or Superman: The Movie, but it still brings in a good transition of how Stark finds his true destiny and purpose. The effects for the film are stupendous all the way. The only problem I found with the movie was 2 things. One the later half of the movie changed from what seemed to be a serious comic book movie, into an adrenaline fueled action extravaganza. Sure action is cool, but the way the ending was placed with him fighting the other Iron Man...it felt sort of silly; As if the ending was just a filler to have Iron Man facing someone for the hell of using more effects and having the audience feel the use of the 135 million dollar budget for the film. Above all this the movie is still a triumphant adaptation; the majority of the characters are superb in their acting. Downey Jr excels marvously as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and it's a great movie to watch with the family...I think. Anyways a must own by fans of the genre or new comers.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5"
"result.3","The big screen was blessed this year with two superlative comic book adaptations, ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"".  What's not to like about ""Iron Man""?  Good acting, characters that are full bodied and make sense, good visual effects and edge-of-your-seat action.  What's my reservation about the flick?  It feels like an incomplete film.  It seems like it's mostly exposition.  By the time the flick really heats up it's over.  It's like the makers of the ""Iron Man"" were so confident in it's success that they're setting you up for the sequel which, now with the film's success, is inevitable.  I might elevate this film to five stars if the sequel's any good."
"result.4","This is one of the best movies to showcase HD capabilities.  I popped this in the Playstation 3, on a 61 inch Samsung DLP with a Denon soundbar and it was amazing.  The Iron Man suit looks like it is standing right in front of you.  I didn't know the suit had so much detail and movement until I watched it at home.  It looks better at home than it did in the theater.  The sound is superb.  You must watch this with the audio turned way up.  You can hear every blast and jet propulsion sound coming from the suit when Iron Man is flying.  My favorite visual and audio part is when Iron Man is flying in the sky and the 2 jets are chasing him.  Turn the volume way up and hear the surround sound go from one side of the room to the other as Iron Man and the jets fly by.  I love it.  Simply amazing.  One of the better movies in Blu Ray.<br /><br />All the special features, BD live plus a digital copy to watch on your iPhone/iPod makes this a great deal!"
"result.5","If you know the Iron Man comic, you know the story. Billionaire inventor and weapons producer Tony Stark is captured by renegade forces who want him to create a super-weapon for them. After requesting the supplies he'll need, Stark instead creates a metal suit for himself, using it to bust out of captivity. Now fully realizing the great havoc his weapons inflict, Stark vows to act as a protector of the human race and undo some of the damage his creations have caused.<br /><br />I thought that this movie was good, but I was actually expecting it be a tad more spectacular. Maybe because I'd heard it being discussed in glowing terms for the better part of a year. It's hard to live up to such hype.<br /><br />I thought Robert Downey Jr. did a fabulous job. Gwyneth Paltrow did a fair job for the role she had, but Pepper Potts didn't seem to be a very pivotal character in this film. I loved Terence Howard, and I'm disappointed about the rumors that he may be replaced in the next film in the series. Jeff Bridges chewed the scenery gloriously. (He looks very ominous without his hair!)<br /><br />The effects were great, and I'm glad to see how the SpiderMan series and King Kong have cemented a new rule of thumb in hero/effects films (one started by Titanic, I think): even if the movie is all about effects, it will be better if you cast people who can actually ACT in the lead roles. (Not just models. Not just bodybuilders. ACTORS.) Everything will benefit from strong performances at the core of the film, even if you think audiences are really only coming to see you blow stuff up."
"result.6","I'd never seen Iron Man in Comic Book form, so his character was new to me.  Everyone plays their parts perfectly to such an extent that I can't picture anyone else playing them.  Story is totally cohesive and editing is fantastic.  Main sound effects seem to be either the booms of explosions, fights or Iron Man flying around.  Either way the bass effects are truly outstanding.  We just watched it for our first time and we both are looking forward to another viewing soon.<br /><br />Mark Zimmerman, Chicago  -  Bipolar Bear"
"result.7","IRON MAN is a total blast.  My husband and I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time.  Based on the Marvel comic book and created by the brilliant Stan Lee, IRON MAN is a super-hero, a science fiction, an action-action adventure, and a heartwarming, feel-good movie, all rolled into one.<br /><br />In IRON MAN, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a playboy genius, a cross between DaVinci, Tesla, and Don Juan.  As the CEO of Stark Industries, he has single handedly revolutionized the defense industry in his attempt to bring security and peace to the world.  When he is kidnapped by terrorists, Tony Stark realizes that the technology he has been steadily inventing since he was a child is falling into the wrong hands, bringing devastation and death to those he is trying to protect.  In captivity, Stark builds the prototype IRON MAN suit, and escapes.  Back at home, Stark has a crisis of conscience and decides to stand down Stark Industries weapons divisions.  Building the ultimate mech suit, Stark becomes IRON MAN, and single handedly sets out to end terrorism and save the world.  Of course, nothing is ever easy...<br /><br />All of the performances in IRON MAN are excellent and very enjoyable.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s transition from philandering whiz kid to caring, sincere patriot who wants to do the right thing is outstanding and real.  The rest of this fantastic cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub) are equally good, creating believable, genuine characters, both good and evil.  The special effects rock, and are seamless and very fun.  The computer that runs Stark's home and inhabits the IRON MAN suit is very funny, exhibiting an acerbic wit that must have been very fun to write.<br /><br />There are some pretty big clues that are more IRON MAN movies to come.  I sure hope so.  I can't wait to see IRON MAN continue his fight for ""truth, justice, and the American way."""
"result.8","Experiencing IRONMAN in the theatre was breathtaking, unbelievable, and larger than life. A GREAT STORY. WELL TOLD.<br /><br />Not since then have we been able to re-experience that magical event until NOW. Yes my fellow movie buffs this Blu-ray Hi-def Picture and Hi-def Sound now is in your home in the HD Home Theater (w/HDMI).<br /><br />My qualifying statement:  My HD Home Theater weighs in at about $2000 plus movies.  A break down is; a Mitsubishi HD Projector (HC-1500) $800 (orig $1495), a Sony 5.1 Blu-ray Sound System (HT-SS2300) $399 (orig $499) and a Sony PLAYSTATION 3 w/Blu-ray player $399 (orig $499). Sony HDMI cables $150 and HD Screen Paint Kit $180 for my 108"" viewing wall screen.  With this 1080p system I've created a HD Home Theater presentation sight and sound equal to an IMAX (on a smaller scale) experience.<br /><br />The 1080p Blu-ray showing blows your minds eyes and ears, period.<br /><br />This IRONMAN 2 Disc set is ALL HD and the Special Features (with over 3 hours of great stuff) covers every detail about the movie and the IRONMAN history from comic book to HD Movie.  Therefore no movie commentary is necessary! Totally awesome movie and background information.  A must have Blu-ray movie for your Sci-Fi Action Hero library.<br /><br />Bottomline: Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark/IRONMAN.  Gweneth Palthrow is Pepper Potts!!  Get you'll watch it over and over.  Enjoy."
"result.9","I was surprised to find that this was not just another formula super hero movie. Of course there were tremendous action scenes, and very evil villains, but the hero was different. The hero was intelligent. It was so refreshing to watch someone with great intelligence problem solve during ""impossible situations"". Also, although he starts out as a rebel with a bad streak, he experiences a major transformation and the audience gets to watch his character develop in a way that I found to be meaningful.<br /><br />Although the movie dragged a bit at some points, it became so interesting that I wanted it to keep going. In fact, I'm really looking forward to the next Iron Man movie (the plot totally calls for it so I'd guess it will happen).<br /><br />I would also mention that Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding. I've always considered him to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and he did not disappoint. Of course Gweneth Paltrow did an excellent job as well.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would highly recommend this movie, particularly to those who enjoy intelligent characters, action, sci-fi and good vs. evil."
"result.10","I'm a Batman girl myself, but if they continue to make Iron Man films as good as this one then I'll become a fan.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. does a really good job in this film. His ability to make the one liners snap really works, and I was laughing at plenty of them. He was also really convincing as a genuis billionare weapons manufacturer. He almost made it look like a really cool and fun job.<br /><br />But of course it's not. He's kidnapped and forced to build, and use, his own weapon against himself and his country. But instead of doing that he invents a suit that turns out to be an awesome piece of technology.<br /><br />The special effects are really cool in this movie. They don't really look CGI or anything at all. They feel pretty real even though you know none of it is likely to be possible in say next year.<br /><br />The movie flows along at a pretty good pace. It's rather short, but you don't notice it until the movie is done. I really like that it seems longer, but isn't.<br /><br />The entire cast I felt was really good in this. The action was perfect, the imaginative weapons and gadgets on the suit were hot. The robots were even a life to themselves.<br /><br />Super cool movie."
"result.1","Actually...........he didn't turn to steel in a great magnetic field.<br />Nor did he travel time for the future of mankind.<br />Kind of like Spiderman I never really knew much about Iron Man.<br />So.............I tried to watch this with an open mind.<br />Ok, let's be brutally honest here. By the time I popped Iron Man into the DVD player I had just gotten home after being out with the co workers.<br />Iron Man got popped into the DVD player and I plopped down on the couch, not just tipsy, not just a little woozy.

"result.2","I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.<br /><br />Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.<br /><br />The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.<br /><br />And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well."
"result.3","This movie is the story of how a billionaire playboy becomes a superhero in a metal supersuit. It takes you through a man's epiphany of his role in a destructive system to his initiation of a system of protection and justice. Because...he's Iron Man. :)<br /><br />IRON MAN was not one of my fave comics growing up in...er...many years ago. I was more into the X-Men and Daredevil and The Flash and The Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange. When I heard they were making Iron Man as a film with Downey, my first thought was, ""Huh? Downey?""<br /><br />I should accept that when someone can act, they can ACT just about any role. Downey can act. (I always feel a little sad that so much time and energy was sapped by his substance abuse demons, when he could have been playing many more roles.) He proves it by being a believable playboy genius who grows up fast under some great pain and duress when, on a trip to Afghanistan, he becomes a prisoner. From there, the billionaire boink-fiend becomes a man with a...heart. In more ways than one.<br /><br />The second star of the movie is the special effects for the suit. OH MY GOSH! I want one. They managed to make the laughable bright suit I remember from my comics-riddled youth into something cool and effective and...sexy.<br /><br />The effect of his ""heart"" is also quite nifty, though less complex.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is somehow lacking her usual shine and spark here, but she isn't ineffective. I just know she can do better--and I like her a lot--and I was slightly disappointed that she was so, so...not up to Downey in this.<br /><br />POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS follow...you are warned:<br /><br />I didn't like Bridges as the corporate baddie. (Oh, come one. We all know he's the baddie from the first scene, right?) I find he's an actor who's either very on and works, or who's very off and sucks. I think he pretty much sucks here except for one scene. Ah, well.<br /><br />On the plus side, there is humor (Stark's quips and sarcasm and sass is irrepressible) to go with the dark stuff (ie, torture, violence, death, corruption, and so forth). The robot helper is a hoot.<br /><br />Another plus is Terence Howard as the military cutiepie friend of Tony Stark. He manages to be low-key, strong, and effective in his role with very few lines. He even manages to be funny. I like this actor very much.<br /><br />The sets work very well. You get the feeling that Stark really is not only a genius, but sui generis from the environment: His workroom, garage, home--all spectacular. And I do believe it's a Gehry structure in one scene (or a great facsimile of one.)  The reactor is displayed as a wonderful visual nod to the retro science fiction some of us still remember with great nostalgia.<br /><br />The direction is quite good: It has energy like mad when it needs it. It works with Downey's face and buffed-up bod in some highly potent close-ups and angles. But it's not something that is so feverish that you can't feel a decent change of pace. And it's not so showy that the camera becomes the star. At all times, Tony Stark/Downey is the star.<br /><br />When you buy/rent/watch this, make sure to either  sit through the credits (read a magazine, like I did while waiting to see if any goodie extras show up), or fast forward through them, because after the scrolling's done, you get a very brief scene in Stark's mansion where another superhero shows up...and it'll make fans of a particularly cool Hollywood actor holler. (I hollered.) Now I'll count the weeks until Iron Man II comes out.<br /><br />Oh, yeah.<br /><br />And for those who used to watch the Iron Man cartoon on TV aeons ago, you'll hear snatches of the theme song (the really dorky theme song, yes) that's sort of Sinatra-ed up here and altered for a phone ringtone there. Cute.<br /><br />Now, excuse me. I have the old Iron Man comic that tells the origin story, and I'm gonna go read it and see how it compares.<br /><br />Mir"
"result.4","Looking at this year what will most people say was the best comic book movie of 08? Dark Knight, exactly but next in line is without a doubt Iron Man and that's for many different reasons. Out of the 4 comic book movies I can name off the top of my head that were released this year, Iron Man was definitely the coolest, with Dark Knight being the most authentic, Hellboy 2 being the biggest fantasy and Incredible Hulk just being the most insane. Robert Downey Jr. without a doubt made this film what it is, he delivers his very special brand of charisma and acting talent to a very cool and charismatic character. A lot of people have said that you couldn't have gotten a more perfect person to play Tony Stark and they weren't kidding.<br /><br />To those not familiar with the comic or have not yet seen the film, Tony Stark/Iron Man is the owner of the worlds premier weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. In the movie he is kidnapped by terrorists who hold him until he agrees to build them a specialist weapon, he agrees but instead builds an indestructible suit which he will use to break himself out of his prison. He manages to break out, but comes to realise what he's been doing has been the main force in a lot of innocent killings, so he designs a better version of the suit which he will use to help those in need.<br /><br />Downey Jr. has always been known as one of those special actors that will constantly put on amazing performances in little known movies, and very rarely gets a chance at a big time role. Iron Man is one of his biggest roles to date and he gets to star along such greats as Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard. Speaking of Paltrow, I don't think you could have gotten a more perfect role for Tony Starks P.A. Pepper Potts than the Oscar winner. The villain of the film is one hell of a scary guy, Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger is actually one of the more intimidating comic villains I've seen to date. Played by Jeff Bridges, I honestly think the guy deserves a round of applause for his role.<br /><br />All in all a great movie with some spectacular special effects, great action and actually a great message. Watch it, I promise you wont be disappointed."

"result.6","We are a large family (9 of us), and all of us enjoy superhero movies. My husband is a comic book geek, and we have all learned about the DC and Marvel universes via osmosis. In other words, we know our comic book heroes.<br /><br />Ironman far outshines all other comic-based movies to date. This movie has the rare mixture of a comic book feel, great story, characters you care about, AND...NO Cheese. I was hesitant when they cast Downey for the part- I am a huge fan, but felt he would not make a good Tony Stark. I was completely wrong- Downey IS Tony Stark. Flawless. The Director was wise enough to let Downey do what he does best- ad lib. He is a natural comedian, and added just enough humor to turn an ok role into a work of art. This movie would have been average without his comedic presence.<br /><br />Paltrow ended up being a good choice as well. She is like wallpaper most of the movie, present, but not overwhelming. This allows Downey to stay in the spotlight where he belongs.<br /><br />I have seen ALL of the comic based movies, as well as many of the animated straight to DVD as well. Mind you, there are many other good movies. Heath Ledger was INCREDIBLE as the Joker in the latest Batman movie. However, as an overall great comic-based movie, Ironman is going to be really hard to beat as my all-time favorite.<br /><br />I hope there is an Ironman sequel in the planning, and hoping they do as good a job with the Avengers as they did with this one. MArvel has stepped it up a notch. Maybe this will push DC into giving us the Justice League movie we all know they're capable of????"

"result.9","Casting Robert Downey Jr. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0784011680/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Chaplin</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCZGV8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Zodiac</a>) in the title role turns out to be a masterstroke as the beleaguered actor slips easily into all the complexities of a brilliant scientist who also happens to be a billionaire industrialist and a hedonistic playboy whose every pleasure-seeking habit has turned into a death-defying addiction. The textured part of Tony Stark so mirrors Downey's former tabloid-headline-grabbing life that the actor can't help but inform the role with layers of resonance and irony that elevate what could have been a more cookie-cutter superhero epic. At the same time, director Jon Favreau (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Elf</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DBHX4M/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Zathura</a>) has more on his mind than creating another heavily stylized comic book myth, as he spends the first part of the film on establishing the realistic context for his hero's circumstances in rugged, war-torn terrain of Afghanistan. No less than four writers were recruited for the screenplay - Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway - on top of the original work by Stan Lee and his creative team at Marvel Comics. Usually having too many hands is a warning sign of a bad, neutralized movie but not this time - this is smart, provocative entertainment that doesn't forget it's also a popcorn flick with plenty of special effects, nonstop action and an unsubtle sense of good versus evil.<br /><br />The story has Stark, the head of his own multinational corporation specializing in the manufacture of state-of-the-art, mass destruction weaponry, in Afghanistan demonstrating a new guided missile that can launch a multitude of smaller missiles aimed at individual targets. His military convoy is ambushed by insurgents who kill the soldiers escorting him. Stark survives due to the quick-thinking ingenuity of a local Afghan physician who implants a device in Stark's chest to ensure the remaining shrapnel left in his body doesn't travel to his heart. Stark's captors demand that he build a missile like the one he just demonstrated, but instead, he makes an elaborate armored suit and blasts his way out of the cave where he was held hostage. Lots of carnage inevitably ensues, but Stark's miraculous escape sets the stage for the rest of the story. Transformed by his traumatic, three-month experience overseas, Stark has a change of heart which has detrimental ramifications on his company but also allows him to follow his monomaniacal pursuit of building a sleeker, more powerful version of the suit he built in captivity. Three people, in particular, are impacted by Stark's unpredictable actions - his military liaison and best friend Lt. Colonel Jim (""Rhodey"") Rhodes; Stark's cagey second-in-command at Stark Industries, Obadiah Stone; and Stark's devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts.<br /><br />With impressive agility, the often underappreciated Downey makes Stark's transformation palpable and brings surprising conviction to a role that must have seemed absurd on paper. Favreau's other casting decisions also pay dividends though some more than others. Shorn of his thick hair and sporting a salt-and-pepper beard, Jeff Bridges, another actor who never seems to get his due, is still recognizable from his trademark grin and plays the avuncular, villainous Stone with great relish. Credit Bridges for not overdoing what could have been an excessive Willem Dafoe-like turn in the first <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKCH/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Spider-Man</a>. One suspects that Terrence Howard will have more to do in the sequel as Rhodey since he is not called on to do much in this first installment except provide support and official alibis. Playing the distressed female again after a similar role as Polly Perkins in Kerry Conran's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IIPIK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</a>, Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much more to play here as Pepper Potts, but she makes the most of a mostly observational role and effortlessly delivers some of the film's more amusing lines. All the production values are top-notch - as they have to be for this type of franchise - and special mention should be made of J. Michael Riva's elaborate production design (Stark's Malibu estate is quite an eye-catcher), Matthew Libatique's crisp cinematography, and the dozens involved with the seamless CGI effects. Make sure to stay after the credits in order to see a surprise final scene which gives a hint of what the sequel may be about."
"result.10","Up there with Indy 4 and Prince Caspian, Iron Man was one of the top movies I was looking forward to this summer. And thankfully, I was not disappointed. In fact, just about every aspect of the movie impressed me.  As I expected, Robert Downey Jr. captured Tony Stark better than anyone else could have.  The wit, charm, and intensity he brought to the character incorporated everything essential about the billionaire industrialist. He's a playboy, eccentric genius, with a drinking problem. But when Stark discovers that his own company's weapons are being used by terrorists, he decides to live a life of purpose and make some big changes.<br /><br />Donning several versions of Iron Man suits, Tony Stark goes through as much transforming as his inventions. Iron Man is an origin story, but still allows for plenty of depth and character development without letting the story suffer. The supporting cast exceeded expectations: Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and even director Jon Favreau himself plays the small role of Harold Hogan.<br /><br />The special effects and technology also blew me away. From the testing of Stark's armor to the final showdown, viewers will be impressed at the amazing visual effects and plenty of big explosions.  With plenty of humor to lighten up the scenes of intense suspense and action; Iron Man is sure to be entertaining enough for the whole family. And after the credits roll, there's a fun little clip that fellow Marvel comic geeks will enjoy, hinting towards a sequel with some beloved characters.<br /><br />The summer blockbusters have certainly started out with a bang!"
"result.1","The Summer season is here and this year it gets an iron boost from finally a new marvel comic franchise hopeful. Having no expectations for Iron Man I was more than surprised with how much I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This time the Iron Man-to-be, Tony Starks (Robert Downey Jr.), is a weapons manufacturing billionaire, not a nerdy college student. He doesn't need to buy a car to win over his childhood sweetheart, but instead has a super-sized garage with six cars and an assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow) who gets rid of his one night stands. In short, he lives it up in all the luxury one could dream of.<br /><br />While visiting a US base in Afghanistan to sell more of his weapons, the humvee he is riding is ambushed and he is taken captive by Afghani insurgents. They force him to build them one of his famous bombs, but instead he builds a great big metal suit! A suit which he uses to escape back to America successfully, and once home starts building a better one. Seeing the destruction of his weapons when they fall into the hands of insurgents he wants to shut down his weapons company. This does not go over well with a few people and brings us to a climatic fight between a villain (I will let you be surprised who it is) and Iron Man.<br /><br />The casting was perfect. Robert Downey Jr. plays his part as the fast-talking, careless billionaire who gets a reality check brilliantly, and Gwyneth Paltrow is immensely entertaining as Pepper Potts, his cool, calculated assistant. Together they have the perfect amount of chemistry that only increases your desire to see Iron Man II.<br /><br />Iron Man is a strong beginning to what will hopefully, yes I am actually hoping for more, be a successful franchise. Unfortunately with it being a good beginning, is where it faltered, only a little. First you could really tell it was setting up for more as there are actually very few scenes of Iron Man flying around (there are actually many more scenes of Tony building and testing his Iron Man suit) and secondly the end battle was not as spectacular or even intense as most superhero climaxes and ended rather quickly.<br /><br />Still Iron Man is a strong, very strong film to open the Summer Season, and does not disappoint. The mark of a good film is when, even with a running time of 126 minutes, it leaves you wanting more!"
"result.2","Iron Man is a Marvel Comic movie that doesn't disapoint. It's better than Spiderman 3 ""which even Fantastic Four 2 was even more fun than"" with more wit and a lot less whining, crying and.... disco dancing. Hell it's the best Marvel movie since Spiderman, Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2. It slowly picks up which is why it gets compared to the Hulk by some people. However it's always entertaining and more fun than the Hulk.<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr's Stark slowly becomes Iron Man but the movie is never boring since Downey carries the film well with his quick wit. It has pleanty of laughs while Downey himself is very funny while totally owning the character of Stark. He also has chemestry with Gwyneth Paltrow who has a quick wit of her own here as a trustworthy employee of his. Terrance Howard is in good form as well as Stark's military friend. I also liked a bald Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner. When there is action it's super cool and well done. But the movie wouldn't have been as good if Robert Downey Jr. wasn't casted. He's not just funny here but he shows that he can handle playing the heroic type and he does it well."
"result.3","Let me say: A lot of times I go to a movie with high expectations and, though the movie may be good, come out disappointed. I entered Iron Man with HIGH expectations, and came out as satisfied and awe struck as is possible.<br /><br />First, Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man. He positively owns the part, stealing the show in pretty much every scene he is in. However, let us not take away from the good performances given by the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges. The acting is excellent, partly due to the screenplay, which is well paced and funny.<br /><br />With all the superhero movies coming out today, this one ran the risk of being too much like the others; not standing out enough. However, that risk was quickly abolished, in my mind, by a couple things:<br /><br />1. Robert Downey Jr. is so good as the title character...I just can't say it enough.<br /><br />2. The Iron Man armor is AWESOME!<br /><br />3. In my review for Batman Begins, I state the one of the reasons I like it was because the hero didn't actually posses super-human abilities. This one goes even farther in that way: This film is actually set in the real world. Instead of struggles in a city that doesn't exsist, Iron Man is set in the world we live, and therefore we can relate to the story more, as the enemies facing the hero are, more or less, the ones facing us today.<br /><br />Iron Man is my new favorite superhero, and he may very well become yours. Six stars."
"result.4","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a genius with technology.  He inherited Stark Enterprises from his father, and has turned it into the leader in international weapons.  He is wealthy beyond imagination, and lives the playboy life to a hilt, spending as much time as possible drinking, gambling, and pursuing anything in a skirt.<br /><br />On a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, things go wrong and he is kidnapped by a gang of terrorists.  What he sees there changes his outlook on his business.  After three months in captivity, Stark manages to escape.  He returns home determined to change the direction of his company.  This does sit well with the board or Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), his father's partner.  Will the new suit he is building help him with his goals?<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is it is an origin story.  As a result, much of the movie is slow, even for someone like me who is unfamiliar with the character.  What we do get in the way of action scenes are wonderful and had me on the edge of my seat.  The climax didn't quite make sense, but that's worth noting only in passing.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the special effects were great, especially the shots from Iron Man's point of view.  And the robot assistants were very funny, proving a nice balance to some of the darker moments.<br /><br />The biggest problem the movie has is the characters.  Even with all the time spent creating Iron Man, we aren't given time to get to know the characters.  This is especially problematic for Tony who comes across as an egotistical jerk at first.  While his character softens, I never fully warmed up to him.  The other characters are only given one or two notes, and that isn't enough to make us truly care for any of them.<br /><br />Now this isn't a reflection on the top notch actors.  In addition to the two already mentioned, we've got Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow.  They all did the best job they could making the thin characters come to life.  I will admit that I couldn't get past Robert Downey Jr. and his past problems when looking at Tony.  It's more of a personal problem, but it was another stumbling block in any attempts to warm up to Tony.<br /><br />To me, the flaws were equal to the strengths, making this a fun but shallow superhero movie."
"result.5","Before I say anything, I have to say that I reluctantly saw this film. I was mildly curious about it (especially considering it's RD Jr's first big film in a while), but not really enough to want to pay to see it in the theaters. However, my father wanted to see it & I went. Boy was I glad that I did.<br /><br />The movie starts off with an action scene as well as a  bit of an info dump about Tony Stark for the newcomers like me. It doesn't last too overly long, so as not to bore the fans who are well versed in the lore of Iron Man. From there the movie can honestly be divided into three parts. The first concerns Stark's time as a prisoner of war and how he frees himself with the help of another prisoner (the birth of the first suit). The second concerns Stark's improvements of the suit as well as on the technology that is keeping him alive & how Stark tests out the suit. This is easily the most light hearted and thrilling part of the movie. The third is when Stark begins to discover who is behind the sale of his weapons to terrorists & the final showdown with the big baddie. All of these parts flow seamlessly into each other and overall the film is very cohesive. The ending had to have been one of the most awesome I've ever seen, although I must admit that I missed the bonus at the end of Nick Fury (I had to look for it on the net to see it afterwards).<br /><br />The acting was all first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed that the director & crew decided to bring out Paltrow's natural beauty rather than slather her face with makeup. It really lent an edge of ""realism"" to her character. The soundtrack was also incredibly good and it all fit the movie well. All in all, I'd give this film a 5/5. It deserves it. I may rate it lower after rewatching it at home, but at the moment I have to say that I really enjoyed it."
"result.6","""Iron Man"" Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Directed by Jon Favreau<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is head of the extremely successful weapons manufacturer Stark Industries. Tony heads to Afghanistan for a demonstration of his latest creation. Unfortunately on the return trip Stark's military convoy is attacked and Tony is taken captive. His captors demand that he build a missile for them. Tony discovers much to his dismay, that the militia that has captured him is well armed with weapons from none other Stark Industries. His former cavalier attitude about his weapons changes and he decides to move his company into a different direction but first he has to create his means of escape...<br /><br />This was another great addition to the Marvel stable. I can't speak for the die hard Ironman fans about how true the movie is to the comics (I was always a Wolverine Fan) but I think overall the story was well told and well thought out.<br /><br />The Good: I was a little bit skeptical at first but Robert Downey Jr. actually portrayed the Tony Stark Character very well. The movie overall was well cast. I think Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for her role as Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges (formerly the Dude) was very convincing in his role as Obidiah Stane. As always look for Stan Lee to make a cameo but this time he actually plays a known person and it was pretty funny even though very brief.<br /><br />The special effects and action sequences didn't disappoint. The flight sequences were all very fast paced and had good intensity. The suit was very well done and stayed true to the comics from what I've seen.<br /><br />The sound track was also good with tracks from A/C D/C, Black Sabeth and Suicidal tendencies.<br /><br />The Bad: For me nothing. As I said if you are a die hard fan you won't be able to help yourself at picking apart any inaccuracies from the comic to movie translation. There was a little bit of shamless Audi product placement but that is to be expected.<br /><br />Overall: This was another great addition to the Marvel stable. If you are interested in comic based movies got out and see ""Ironman""!"

"result.8","I watched this movie a few nights ago with my teenage son and really enjoyed it. Robert Downey Jr plays Tony Spark, the owner of a company which builds weapons. He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying. He uses this magnet in an invention, an ""Iron Man suit"", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them. When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man.<br /><br />Great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars. Good humor too. I love the suits, I love his cars, and I thought it all really well done.<br /><br />We often have a tough time finding suitable family movies without tons of sex and profanity. This was great!"
"result.9","What would you do if you were a weapons developer; find out that the weapons you manufacture are used to kill innocents and then learn that you have shrapnel near your heart that could kill you at any moment?<br /><br />If you are anything like Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) you'd build a mechanical suit and fight to end your own weapons. And, to prevent your death, you'd create this little gizmo based on a new energy source to prevent the shrapnel from entering your heart. It's this energy that powers your suit.<br /><br />But of course, the bad guys don't want you to succeed, so they'll build a gigantic robot to stop you.<br /><br />This movie is packed with fabulous actors: Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Howard, and Paul Bettany as the voice for Stark's butler, Jarvis.<br /><br />I think this film is better than the Spider-man movies and just up there with Batman Begins. Everything about it is top-notch: acting, writing, chemistry, etc... Some of the best comedic moments are between Tony Stark and his robot assistance as he builds his updated Iron Man suit.<br /><br />The bottom line for my experience of this movie was creativity. The creativity found in this movie was astounding. Everything is crisp and great looking.<br /><br />This is going to join my DVD collection. Can't wait for the sequel!"

"result.1","""Iron Man"" is a great movie.  It is great simply because it provides escapism fun for the length of the movie.  I cannot claim to be a Hollywood movie critic.  I am not going to dissect the acting skills of every actor or the quality of the scenes.<br /><br />All I can say is this - when a movie is over, if I feel moved because of the message it delivers or, in the case of Iron Man, I am excited about the action, etc., and can't wait to watch it again, then I consider it a great movie!<br /><br />Iron Man is a great action movie, pure & simple.  If you like things that fly, explosions, etc., all delivered with a Sci-Fi, eccentric billionaire twist, then you'll probably love Iron Man.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version is superb....explosions, fighting, etc., all provide excellent audio quality.  The video is very good.<br /><br />In summary, I think it's classic movie fun....sit back and enjoy it for what it is - a fun ride!"
"result.2","I'll be the first to admit here that I'm really not a comics buff.<br /><br />I buy comics occasionally and sometimes, I like them. But the comics I buy are far more likely to be, say, the newest trade paperback of Knights of the Old Republic than a Spider-Man comic. In fact, I've never bought a typical superhero comic book, though I've read a few. In part that's because I'm obsessive over continuity and I couldn't force myself to read every Spider-Man, X-Men, or Batman comic in existence. So when I read superhero comics I tend to lean towards new continuities, such as Ultimate Marvel.<br /><br />So I like superhero movies. When they're good. I thought the first Hulk film was embarassingly awful, in spite of having an excellent director and cast. I was passionately disappointed with both the third Spider-Man and X-Men films and I, to this day, still don't understand what's so good about the new Superman movie (but then again I always thought that character was silly). So given all the disappointments I wasn't sure what to expect of the new Iron Man film. On the one hand, the previews looked good, the ratings from critics were astounding (the best rated film this year!), and people had told me it was good. So I had high expectations. But a tiny, little voice inside of me kept telling me that I was setting up for a disappointment, to remember last few year's superhero movies, and that the hype never is lived up to.<br /><br />Fortunately, that little voice was wrong - this time.<br /><br />Surprisingly, given the fact that the script wasn't finished at the time of filming, the story is one of Iron Man's strongest points.<br /><br />The story of Tony Stark's transformation from billionaire to superhero is handled alot better than many origin stories, which often come off as what they are - preludes, prologues, promises for a bigger story. It was the problem with the first Spider-Man film and it was even worse for the first X-Men. But Iron Man, like Batman Begins delivers a story that both promises more (particularly in the last scenes of both) but at the same time delivers a fun and complete story in of itself. Maybe it has something to do with superheroes that don't have superpowers. Or maybe it's because the folks at both Marvel and DC are beginning to realize they need to reinvent the superhero movie into something more in order to retain audience interest after so many.<br /><br />And like the best of the Marvel films it doesn't rely on knowledge of the old superhero comics on which it is based, drawing from both the old continuity and the new Ultimate Marvel stuff. Which is probably the best way to go through with it, since a lot of fans have nostalgia for the old comics but whereas Ultimate Marvel is more befitting for our current time.<br /><br />Tony Stark, of course, steals the show and not least because of the acting behind him. But he also stands on his own as a wry, egotistical, and intelligent superhero who stands out from just about every other superhero. There's not really, as far as I can tell, another guy like him in either the Marvel or DC universes. There's of course the paladin-esque superheroes like Spider-Man or Superman and there's the anti-heroes like Wolverine or Batman (at his best, so long as he doesn't delve into Miller-machismo). But there's not really another superhero who both plays the Lawful Good card and can act like a scoundrel at the same time. It's a nice juggling act and done well here.<br /><br />The transformation of Stark into... a weapons-hater is a little less convincing. This is derived, from what I understand, was a major shift in Marvel's approach to the Vietnam War back in the 1970s, when their readers made it clear they opposed the war (which Iron Man had previously been supporting). So they made Stark into a pseudo-pacifist, which really doesn't work. Thankfully they figure that out and moved on, turning him once again into a super-soldier, though one with a strong set of moral boundaries. I have a feeling, given how Iron Man acts in the film, that this is sort of where Stark is going in the films as well. A good thing too as the whole concept of a superhero walking around in a combat exoskeleton who believes weapons are by default evil and should be destroyed is hardly believable.<br /><br />That said, he doesn't lose his touch once he makes the transformation.<br /><br />As for the supporting characters one of the more interesting is Obadiah Stane, who I'd thought was an original character but who I later learned is from the comics. Although near the end of the film his character declines into cliches throughout about 80% of the film he's as engaging as Stark himself. He fills that borderline between comfort and discomfort, of a character you can't quite really decide on who he is or what he stands for. He's elusive. And that's how it's meant to be and that's how it should be. On the other hand, James Rhodes is less interesting as a character though he still manages to make himself endearing. More or less he's the military man stuck with a guy (Stark, of course) who he likes but can't help but realize is a total pain in the ass. Similarly, Stark's Girl Friday ""Pepper Potts"" (how I wish I was making that name up) is thoroughly and irredeemably boring. Why is it that superhero girlfriends have always got to be absolutely unmissable?<br /><br />The special effects in Iron Man are pretty good - though they're not the best I've seen, either in film *or* in television (they're roughly Battlestar-like in quality). As good as the effects are though, they're not the star of the film's production values. That's the cast. Indeed, there are a large number of big-name actors in this film - the biggest name being the aforementioned Gwyneth Paltrow though oddly she's the least interesting of the cast. But, Robert Downey Jr. (as the titular Iron Man / Tony Stark) and Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane) are the true stars of this film and fill out their roles wonderfully, bringing wit and life to the characters they play.<br /><br />Downey is likely the best casting choice for a superhero lead since Christian Bale and, as OSC put it, ""we never get a sense that the actor is playing his part with tongue in cheek; instead, Downey is playing a character who lives his life with tongue in cheek."" And Downey does this wonderfully. Likewise, Bridges is excellent.<br /><br />Overall, Iron Man is a brilliant superhero film that, alongside The Dark Knight, has helped to reinvigorate the genre."
"result.3","Forgive me for not being familiar with the comic book ""Ironman"" - I've only put a toe in the graphic novel pool and I've flat-out missed this one.<br /><br />So perhaps my rave review of this comic book adaptation is somewhat uninformed.  But given the fact that the filmmakers went for a PG-13 blockbuster approach, it's hard to imagine how director Jon Favreau (no, not President Obama's speechwriter, but the guy from ""Swingers"" and ""Elf"") could have given us a more polished, pitch-perfect movie.<br /><br />Start with a clever and detailed ""birth of Ironman"" story, a pretty funny script, and a wonderful ensemble of top-notch actors, and you've got a great cocktail.  As has been widely commented, the movie starts and stops with Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar performance as genius weapon-designer Tony Stark.  Poking gentle fun at Downey's sordid past, ""Ironman"" provides a fresh perspective on the superhero - Stark is one cool dude.<br /><br />Surrounding him are Gwyneth Paltrow as secretary/love interest Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as sidekick and straight man Rhodey, and Jeff Bridges as the bombastic Obadiah Stane (the name should give you some clues).  These gifted actors breathe life into characters that not only shine in the big scenes but also in the quiet, more mundane moments in the movie.<br /><br />I won't bother recapping the plot - it's pretty by-the-numbers fare - but strongly recommend enjoying this movie for its attention to detail.  Virtually every scene has something to recommend it, which isn't always the case with comic book adaptations because there's often so much darn exposition and backstory.  The first half of the movie shows the birth of Ironman in perhaps the most entertaining form of all - a birth of necessity.  You're so captivated by the character of Stark that you find yourself ignoring the top-notch special effects and how the movie - for all its violence - stays safely on the PG side without descending into ""Phantom Menace"" cartoonishness.<br /><br />An excellent film that has given birth to a new franchising juggernaut (""Ironman 2"" and ""Ironman 3"" are already in pre-production), ""Ironman"" is a guilt pleasure without the guilt."
"result.4","I wish this would be made into the Mark 3 as well but this is close enough. The coloring is the Mark 2. In order to get the Mark 3 you have to have Blue-Ray. This is still available at my Target but you have to go to the back section of DVD's under ""Best Sellers"". I found it between the 2 disc special edition of Iron Man and Jeff Dunham Spark of Insanity. I suggest throwing away the plastic case that the mask comes in cause you're really not gonna need it. So it is the same as the 2 disc edition. I would use the Hall of Armor feature most. This is also like The Dark Knight Batman Head Case. I recomend buying it."
"result.5","Seeing this on the heels of watching the new James Bond Quantum of Solace and the re-make of the Day The Earth Stood Still (two huge disappointments) Iron Man was a very pleasant surprise. The film had plot, acting, dialogue, direction, special effects, humor - what a concept, maybe this type of film making could catch on in Hollywood. What do you think? I'm already anxious for the sequel. Weak spots - not too many, perhaps Jeff Bridges characters motivation. But that's nit picking."
"result.6","Somewhere between the genius of Batman & Spiderman essence and the extreme ComicBookesqueness of Starship Troopers.  Simplistic, similar messages for all, but separated works by the means and methods of the execution.  Downey is a bit clownish and never really a convincing character in his minimal dialogue, slapstickish role - starts and ends as a 2-D fellow.  Not sure what Palthrow's issue and direction were but who cares,  Jeff Bridges came off solid and believable as the egomaniac come of age.  Storyline and plot are chop shopish at best and connected only by the action.<br />Overall, entertaining 2hours worthy of three stars and a rental.  In rank with the hulk and fantastic four but not quite the 'man' enough to keep pace and face with the spider, bat, and super."
"result.7","""Iron Man"" entertains exceedingly well thanks to the jovial performance of Robert Downey Jr.  While his song ""Your Move"" from the 4-year old CD <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064AFK0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">The Futurist</a> is just now in my personal top ten sounding like a new record from Yes, I picked up a copy of ""Iron Man"" for my rainy day video shelf.  Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for ""Chaplin"" and for a Golden Globe in 2000 for TV's ""Ally McBeal.""  As weapons dealer Tony Stark, he moves from the hard-nosed wheeler dealer to a man with a conscience.  I understood why Jeff Bridges' character Obadiah Stane would want to remove him after he has a conscience, but wasn't altogether clear why he wanted to get rid of Tony when he was a money maker.  Perhaps it was jealousy.  The great humor that Downey brings to the role, particularly with his eccentric machine that keeps wanting to spray him to put out fires, makes the action all the better.  There is also a hint of romance with Pepper Potts played by Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow for 1998's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGOH/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Shakespeare in Love</a>.  Terrence Howard has been a favorite actor of mine since <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a> and his Oscar-nominated role in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITUWU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"">Hustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Perhaps one of the best parts is played by Shaun Toub who shined in the Oscar winning ""Crash"" as the Iranian store clerk.  In captivity, Stark meets Toub's Yinsen who becomes his assistant and sacrifices himself for Tony.  Faran Tahir as the rebel leader Raza is excellent.  John Favreau who is currently acting in ""Four Christmases"" directs the film and keeps the pace breakneck.  This is a great action/special effects picture.  Enjoy!"
"result.8","Now that all of our summer blockbusters have become nothing but comic book super heroes, some of them still deliver a great time.<br /><br />IRON MAN is one of them.<br /><br />I used to get Iron Man comics as a kid but he wasn't as popular and iconic as Superman or Batman.  In fact, I can't remember any of the villains from his comics, but he had a cool suit and the artwork was as topnotch as the best of Marvel during the 70s.<br /><br />The film version definitely has as much to offer as the best of the super hero movie.

"result.10","Iron Man  (2008) One of Marvel Comics' coolest, if not most famous superheroes finally gets brought to the big screen for the first time in this new flick from director Jon Favreau. Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a brilliant billionaire industrialist and weapons manufacturer carrying on the legacy of his late father in designing bigger and better weapons to protect this great land of ours. He is a hard drinking, womanizing, self centered vanity case, but his charm carries him, along with the piles of money he makes. While on a junket in Afghanistan to show off his newest missile, Stark's convoy is attacked and he is caught by a ruthless Afghani terrorist cabal. The attack left Stark with deadly shrapnel in his chest, threatening his heart, but a fellow scientist prisoner manages to cobble together a nasty looking but effective electromagnetic pacemaker and jam it into Stark's chest to hold the shrapnel at bay. The terrorists want Stark to build them one of his new missiles, but seeing them using his weaponry, devices he created to protect Americans, which there should be no way they could have, Stark has a figurative change of heart to go along with his literal one. He agrees to make the rocket, and makes a list of materials he'll need. When the baddies give him the goods however, he instead cobbles together a clunky but highly effective armored battlesuit he uses to wipe out most of the villains and escape. Back in America, Stark picks up his old life with Air Force pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard), mentor Stane (Jeff Bridges), and especially Girl Friday Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). He does have to deal with wearing a glowing chest ornament the size of a small dinner plate, but no Marvel Comics hero's life is perfect, no matter how much money he has. Stark also takes the battlesuit design further, building a sleeker, faster version that turns him fully into the superhero Iron Man. Now, with all this high tech weaponry at his disposal, he has to find out who has sold him out by selling his weapons design to Afghani terrorists. And, unknown to Stark, that same someone is using the pieces of his first design to reverse engineer an even larger, more deadly battlesuit. Once again, jumping right into line with ""Michael Keaton as Batman"" I wasn't sure an Iron Man movie starring Robert Downey Jr and directed by Jon Favreau would be what I wanted it to be. And once again I couldn't have been more wrong. Downey is totally committed and up to the game, giving Stark a roguish charm that is simply perfect, and he's not afraid to let the identity hiding armor take over when Iron Man shows up. Of course, it doesn't hurt that unlike Spider-Man, director Favreau can cut to close-ups of Downey inside the armor, so we the audience still get to see all the emotions the actor's face can show without having to rip the hero's mask off in every scene. The casting is perfect down the line, with every actor and actress looking exactly like the comics' version, and that extends to the moment after the credits too many people will have missed, a fine bit that promises more fun to come AND ties this film directly to another summer release this year. (Crossover sequel anyone?) Kudos to director Favreau for balancing the action and lighter moments, and providing a lot of flash bang but not letting the movie coast on the effects. (He also takes a prime role for anyone familiar with Iron Man's comics backstory as chauffeur ""Happy"" Hogan, who doesn't get a lot of screen time here, but promises to show up more in the sequel and get some quality time with Paltrow!) All in all a fun flick I highly recommend to those so inclined."
"result.1","One of the best comic-book movies ever! That comes from a big-time comic-book and comic-book movie fan. Everything felt right. Robert Downey JR was born to play Tony Stark/Iron Man. Jeff Bridges still plays a bad guy as well as anybody onscreen. Gweneth Paltrow IS Pepper Potts in look and characterization. Marvel hit one out of the ballpark with this movie.<br /><br />The story updates the characters for a more modern look and feel. Instead of Vietnam we are in the middle east. Yet, the update is so true to who the characters are that they never lose track of how things should be. The first Iron-Man armor is crudely built to escape from the bad guys. Tony Stark's motivation for being Iron-Man is stronger than his comic book's version. Here he is fighting to undo the bad (Stark's company selling weapons for war usage) by becoming Iron-Man.<br /><br />Once back home Tony goes through a few Iron Man armors which fits in perfectly with his comic book history. I don't say this with a grain of salt, this is one of the best comic book movies ever! It stays very true to the comics but also adds to the characters. We almost know what's coming but the movie still surprises. It's one of the rare comic book movies that holds up in repeat viewings. I'd put this up with the first two Spidey movies. first two Superman movies, Tim Burton's and the current Batman movies & X-Men 2. This movie is so good (and I was skeptical going in because I always liked Iron Man) that I wonder how they will top it in the sequel. It's going to be fun finding out.<br /><br />I don't even recommend renting this movie. BUY IT! Nuff said."
"result.2","Iron Man seems made for Blu-Ray, although it succeeds in any format.  This witty, human, explosive action film sets a high standard, along with The Dark Knight, for the genre.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark, a playboy, irreverent billionaire who believes, like his father, that whoever had the biggest stick keeps the peace.  His company provides the US government with high tech weapons meant to destroy enemies in enormous numbers, and he sees nothing wrong with it.  However, Tony finds himself at the wrong end of Stark Enterprises and has an epiphany.  Iron Man emerges from this psychological low:  a uniquely powered metal suit with jet packs, flame throwers, and brute strength that houses Stark.  A weapon, yes, but one designed to protect.  Unfortunately, his displaced second, once the CEO of Stark Enterprises, Stane (Jeff Bridges) does not agree with the direction Stark intends to take his company.<br /><br />Downey, Jr. is simply perfect for the role of Tony Stark -- he plays smarmy as well as he does brilliant, intense as well as he does comic, heartless as well as he does lovable. His facial expressions while ""inside"" the Iron Man suit remind us that a human we can empathize with is contained within the seemingly invincible armor.  Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet, if a little ditzy, as romantic interest Pepper Potts, but her performance stands up against Downey Jr's charismatic screen presence, not an easy feat.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning, particularly on Blu-Ray, and the soundtrack is powerful.  The Blu-Ray comes with two discs containing some special features of note:  the creation of the special effects; interviews/commentary, mostly with Stan Lee, of the evolution of the comic book series; and a fun glimpse into Downey Jr's and Bridge's rehearsal of one scene.  Blu-Ray also includes BD Live, if you're into that kind of online chat.  (I don't have the regular DVD, but I assume that the two-disk version has the same extras, minus BD Live.)<br /><br />This was a fun, action-packed, and at times humorous superhero film. Unlike some blockbusters, this film uses special effects to supplement the acting and the action, not the other way around.  I enjoyed every minute of it."
"result.3","Get this in the blu ray version.  It looks alot better than the other version and this is great movie.  Everyone in it does a fantastic job<br />that makes this a awesome movie that is everything a blockbuster should be: Entertaining, fine acting, a solid story,  brilliant effects ,<br />and it has characters that are well rounded.  And jeff bridges who makes a fine villian in this story.  He was always underestimated as a actor and this movie lets him create a believable slimy villian who might be working in any organization.  The movies have finally caught up to my old 1960's comic books in their ability to depict great fantasy heroes."
"result.4","This is a great entertainer done very well. But how does Ironman compete so well with the Spidey and Superman films that have already established a following?<br />Ans:<br />1. With a great script, catchy dialouges and funny one-liners. You'll get enough of them throughout the movie.<br />2. Great chemistry between co-stars. Particularly between Robert Downey Jr and Gwenyth Paltrow, particularly in the gadget inserting scene, and at the party. The pair is so good they give the Clark Kents-Louis Lanes and Peter Parkers-MJ's a run for their money.<br />3. Decent special effects -This movie doesn't dethrone Spidey and Superman films but you will not be disappointed. The scene showing Ironman breaking the sound barrier on his trip to the village in Afghanistan where he rescues a village from the terrorists was a stroke of a genius. This is something that the Superman movies didn't think of in all these years. The action isn't bad too.<br />3. Many funny scenes - However one of them topped them all. This is the one where Tony is enjoying the wine and trying to look at the stewardesses dancing and at same time trying to pretend he is communicating with his friend who is completely vexed and frustrated trying to get his attention. Earlier in a picture bio, Tony is shown with Bill Gates. That was a nice one too.<br /><br />I wonder why the linguist behind the film made the terrorists speak both Hindi and another language. Jeff Bridges does a good job. Robert Downey Junior makes a great comeback and Gwenyth does a pleasant job as the secretary. Except for one small scene that can be passed off lightly, this movie can be watched by your kids too.<br /><br />Sans Ozzie's vocals, it was great to hear the riffs from Black Sabbath's ""IronMan"" at the end of the movie.<br /><br />If you left the cinema hall during the end-credits, at the end of the end-credits, Samuel L Jackson appears and confronts Tony Stark indicating to us that a sequel is in the making. Not to forget Tony's entry in the last minutes in ""Incredible Hulk"" movie. Something's brewing there too. I am sure we can expect more from him."
"result.5","I have never been a comic book guy, and super hero movies are seldom high on my ""I got to see that"" list. However due to the almost universal praise of this film by reviewers that I have come to trust, I gave it a try and got the Amazon Video on demand purchase last weekend. I got the Hulk on a rental for the above listed reasons, and quite liked it as well, and was happy I watched it first, to get the tie in of Tony Stark industries...<br /><br />In any case I watched it by myself first because my wife is really not a ""Comic Book GUY"" but I thought it was so good I asked her to watch it, and surprisingly she enjoyed it as well. So why does a comic book work as a movie? It is an interesting story about a life changing epiphany, and how the things you want, may not be the ones you need or love. It is an interesting story about the futility of bargaining with evil. And how any evil thing we do may come back to bite us in the backside, no matter the motives.<br /><br />Also... Iron man is a fun movie with wonderful CG's a very cool visual experience. So, leave your disbelief at the door, and enjoy this very fun ride of a movie!<br />4 1/2*"
"result.6","I think that movie makers have to wait till the technology is there to produce a certain movie that might require sophisticated effects and not just wait for a good script and have the technology (if not mature enough) ruin the film.  George Lucas did it with his Star Wars prequels and the producers of Iron Man chose to do it the same way too.  The movie is a combination of a good script (many times side-lined in such movies) and very good special effects.  Robert Downey proved he is a good actor in this movie by getting in the right shape required and as usuall living the role.  Overall another Marvel hit which I'm sure will encourage Marvel to bring more and more of their superheros onto the big screen."
"result.7","IRON MAN moved along at a break-neck pace, and for the most part, the plethora of CGI effects were never allowed to clobber some of the first-rate acting by Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow. There was also some extremely funny dialogue, and excellent physical humor by Downey, who for my money, is far less wooden than most of the super heroes buzzing around screendom these days ( with the notable exception of Ron Perlman ). Fun stuff."
"result.8","The producers of this movie surely knew what a fan would enjoy. It has hours of behind the scenes, design of the costume, etc. The treats and trinkets hardcore fans of dvd's and of ironman will love.<br />A delightful movie even if your not a comic book fan. Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast. A great story and a visually pleasing movie.<br />You get alot for your money."
"result.9","I've been a big fan of the Iron Man comic book series for such a long time and from the ""Tales of Suspense"" comic books, as a young child, I would always be into the ""Avengers"" and even be this happy child with his ""Secret Wars"" Iron Man toy.<br /><br />Years before ""IRON MAN"" became a movie, I've always pictured Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.  He had the look and even back then with Downey Jr.'s personal life, there is some instances that mirror Tony Stark's challenges in the comic books.  So, suffice to say that I was quite happy with him being cast for the film.<br /><br />As for the the film, I had no doubt in my mind that ""IRON MAN"" would be a blockbuster hit in the Summer but I purposely waited for it to come out on DVD, so I can watch it on my own personal home theater and watch it with no distractions.<br /><br />This film focuses on Tony Stark, the millionaire who runs Stark Industries which creates weapons for the military but while on a meeting to the Middle East, Stark's military escort are gun down and eventually the suave millionaire gets caught in a blast (from weapons created by his company), next thing you know, Stark is being operated on and being held by prisoner by terrorists.<br /><br />While under captivity, Stark creates his first Iron Man uniform and uses it to escape his captors.  Upon returning back to America, Stark's perspective of the world and his company has changed.  Also, his goal to develop a more technologically advanced mobile suit armor becomes his obsession and leads him to take on the terrorist who have been using his companies weapons for evil but most of all prepare for the lies and deceptions that await him.<br /><br />AUDIO & VIDEO:<br /><br />The version that I am reviewing is the regular widescreen DVD, not the awesome Blu-ray version packed with a lot of extras.  But the audio for this version is Dolby Digital 5.1 and video is widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This ""IRON MAN"" DVD version features deleted and extended scenes.  Deleted scenes that I'm glad the director chose to eliminate from the final cut of the film.<br /><br />There are three versions of this release on DVD/Blu-Ray.  This version is the single disc version, the double disc version features many featurettes including a 108-minute documentary, a six part documentary and more.  The Blu-ray version has received almost perfect stars for its amount of content and BD-Live.  So, if you have a Blu-ray player, the Blu-ray version of ""IRON MAN"" is what is recommended.<br /><br />After watching it, I definitely enjoyed the film but like any superhero film, as the first film always focuses on the origin, this series will be judged on its continuing storylines.  Similar to like the ""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"" and the ""Fantastic Four"" films, there is always the ""origin"" that not many people are too enthusiastic about and want to see more battles.<br /><br />Fortunately, ""Iron Man""did offer quite a bit of kick as battles but I loved the scene where Iron Man just rescues a village being terrorized by the enemies.<br /><br />Again, Robert Downey Jr. did a great job as Tony Star, Jeff Bridges as Obidiah Stane was pretty good.  As for Terrence Howard's James Rhodes... it was OK but I was expecting more of a no-nonsense Rhodes.  But with Don Cheadle replacing Howard for the next film, I hope that Cheadle can bring the attitude especially if he's going to be War Machine.<br /><br />But definitely enjoyed this film.  With ""IRON MAN"", unlike any other top tier Marvel superheroes, Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of inner demons to contend with and is such a complex character.  For the comic series, the alcoholism consumed him and I'm curious to see if it happens in the films.  It will definitely be interesting to see how his character is explored and what new Iron Man outfit we will see him sporting next Silver Centurion Iron Man?  Maybe even see some Hulkbuster or Thorbuster?  Who knows.  And of course, there is James Rhodes as War Machine and I look forward in seeing that character come to play in the films.<br /><br />But all in all, ""IRON MAN"" was an enjoyable film for the first version.  A lot of action, special effects but definitely would like to see where they go with the characters in the next upcoming film.<br /><br />All in all, a very cool movie and enjoyed it so much, now I'm going to have to pick up the Blu-ray ultimate edition next!"
"result.10","From what i have seen Iron Man is a ok movie. It has a decent plot but the acting could have been better. It was a big buget movie but like I said the acting could have been better. Dont get me wrong it was a good movie all around movie. but i give it a four out of five stars.<br /><br />Iron man started out really slow. This was supposed to be a action movie but, the action didnt start until the middle of the movie. when the action came in it was when he ws braking out of the cave in the desert.<br /><br />alot of people thought that it was goign to be just another crapy marvel movie like fantastic four it was actually really good."
"result.1","I love this movie!  This product got lost in the mail, so a replacement was sent and arrived in about two days, then the original lost one showed up two days later.  I appreciated the prompt replacement and only had a slight headache dealing with the return of the original.  Overall, a pleasing experience, not flawless, but the flaws were promptly dealt with and that was excellent."
"result.2","This superhero movie has it all...action, humor, romance, and more.<br /> The two disc set is interesting, but I see why they deleted the extra scenes."
"result.3","The movie was not too long, just right I would say. Has good flow and well photographed."
"result.4","This is one of the better comic book movies.  Acting, dialogue, storyline, pacing, special effects are all above-average."
"result.5","This blu-ray is all a blu-ray should be. Amazing sound and awesome picture quality topped off by great price. Amazon is practically the only place I buy blu-ray mivies now."
"result.6","This is one of the few movies I've seen in theaters in recent years. I was entertained and impressed by the level of story, bringing back much of the joy of the Iron Man comic books I read when young. The action and CGI use wasn't merely there because they could do it; it was integral to the story development and contributed to the wild ride. The DVD's extras are great, explaining all the actors went through in preparation for the movie. Robert Downey, Jr. had to learn a different type of wire use as the director didn't want it to look like Peter Pan. It works well. I was eager to see the DVD and I wasn't disappointed in the least."
"result.7","Ironman is a top notch superhero movie!! It stands right there with Spider-Man 1,2, and 3 as well as Batman Begins\The Dark Knight."
"result.8","Robert Downey Jr. simply owns this film. He makes the whole gamut work - snide capitalist pig, sentimental son, vengeful menace and hero. The movie is sprinkled thoroughly with some of the most witty dialog I have heard in a very long time. The SFX are completely amazing, never falling short of suspension of disbelief. Well worth the time spent."
"result.9","I haven't read any of the comic books of Iron Man, so I came into this as something of a blank slate. I knew, from reading other Marvel comics back in the day, who he was and a little of his origins. I also knew he was an alcoholic, so I couldn't help but snicker when I found out Robert Downey Jr was picked to play Tony Stark. ""How perfect,"" I thought. ""Bound not to be much of a stretch for him.""<br /><br />Thankfully, he turned out to be far, far better in the role than I had expected! He really owns every single seen he's in, and brings a real sense of confidence and ease to the picture.<br /><br />You know the plot by now: Tony Stark, billionaire weapons designer, is captured by terrorists while on a visit to a place suspiciously similar to Afghanistan. They try to force him to build a new weapon for them, and instead he builds it for himself, emerging in a suit of armor and becoming Iron Man.<br /><br />It's a simple plot, but it works very well. The film succeeds on several levels due largely to the good writing, excellent pacing and wonderful action. But what really brings it home is the great acting on the part of Downey, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow. They make this film what it is.<br /><br />There's really not much else to say here. It's an entertaining, well-done popcorn flick. Not a perfect movie, but certainly a stunning example of what the genre can do and easily the second best super hero film of 2008."
"result.10","To consider Comic Book character Movies as a serious genre.  I know some people think there are a lot of them out there and might be getting sick of them...but you have to face it, they are a great source of material.  And they are getting better as a whole.<br /><br />With the release of three superhero movies this summer (Iron Man, Hulk, The Dark Knight), you would think one of them really stunk.  Not so.  And with the release of Watchmen next year, I gaurentee many people will see a much different side of comic book heroes then they have before.  But I digress.  Let's talk Iron Man.<br /><br />Iron Man is an iconic character in the Marvel universe.  Everyone knows his name, partially thanks to Black Sabbath.  But bringing him to the screen could have been really tricky.  Especially when you announce Robert Downey Jr. is going to play Tony Stark, the ambitious, brilliant and self centered billionaire industrialist who becomes the title character.  Downey might seem, to fans, too smarmy for the role.  But thankfully he is a great fan of the character himself and choose not to make any great changes.  For the most part, he plays Stark brilliantly, but adds his own touch as well.  In the comics, Stark is a brilliant playboy, with very little sense of humor.  As for Downey's version, he brings wit and a sense of being aloof.  It's just what the character needed.<br /><br />Plot wise, it's simple.  Stark is captured and forced to build a missile for a terrorist group.  He rebels in his own way; he builds a suit of armor from the pieces in order to escape.  Since he realizes the weapons his company makes are being stolen by or sold to the enemies, he announces a halt on all weapon producing industry.  He starts working on his own project of creating a suit of armor based around his heart supporting energy source.  At first, he just wants to fly.  But then incorporates weapons to take out the terrorist group.<br /><br />Director Jon Favareau deserves a lot of credit for balancing the serious with the brilliant with the humorist on this one.  Iron Man is one of the best Superhero movies ever to be made and Downey makes Stark his most entertaining character to date."
