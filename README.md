# Ezyme Classifier Using ML

Projct aims at classifying FASTA format protien sequences using multiclass classification algorithms in Spark.

## Steps to final classification

1. Data Preparation through python script
2. Convert raw data csv and then to libsvm in R
3. Run spark ML algos in jupyter notebook

## Spark-MLlib Algorithms Used

### Logistic Regression Classifier
### Decision Tree Classifier 
### Random Forest Classifier
As per our evaluation, this gives us best result with accuracy of 57% with 30 trees. We can further work on this to increase number of trees, max depth and other hyper parameter tunings
### Feedforward Artificial Neural Network Classifier
