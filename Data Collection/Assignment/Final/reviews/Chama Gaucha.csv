"1705045","Rooftop sitting ensures nice breeze even in the summers. Food though a tad pricey, is well made and the portions rather fulsome. Service can improve though staff acts in earnest. Tacos and nachos stand out. On a negative note, the music requires some attention. Started with nice Latin American lounge types but somewhere it shifted to some radio channel with hindi and telugu songs which seemed out of place for a lounge, not to mention even some ads being played in between!",4,"2019-03-25 19:34:28",119,110,0

"2452778","After a lot of thinking (uh-uh), finally we were here and we do not regret this decision. It was lovely evening and what more can make the weekend start beautiful other than meeting an old friend over drinks and dinner by the pool in a rooftop restaurant with live music. The breeze pleasantly caressing the hair. Oh yes! We just loved it. This Brazilian-Mexican restaurant was an absolute delight for this evening. They have quite a romantic setting for a dinner date.
It was my first time to try a completely new cuisine and I must say I was overwhelmed. We ordered Coxa De Frango (Brazilian entr√©e) and Baked Fish in Veracruz Sauce (Mexican entr√©e). Well starting with the Mexican dish- the fish fillet was soft, saucy, mouth watering with sweet and sour tastes of Veracruz with Chopped üçÖ, bell peppers, onions, seasoned with oregano but wasn't served as mentioned in the menu. On the other hand the Brazilian dish had nicely fried chicken which was juicy & tender on the inside, with beautiful aroma and spicy flavours and again wasn't served as mentioned in the menu. Seriously!!! What the hell is wrong with you guys ü§îü§®üòßüò†. That was very disappointing. If something is not available or change in the way it is served then why not inform the customer.
My Overall rating- 3.8/5. Sorry guys it wasn't served as promised in the menu. Thats disappointing. We order coz of the whole package not just a part of it. The food is little over priced as you may not get exactly what you ordered.Souvik Banerjee",3,"2019-03-04 20:05:10",70,2035,0
"41451016","Went to celebrate wedding anniversary. Restaurant is at terrace so the calm coolevening weather is a big plus to ve experienced. But the place layout is too mixed up with the hotel swimming pool also setup there. Saw a lot of male gentry as opposed to the couple's place promoted by the hotel. Food is tasty but way over priced for the setting provided. Smoking by other patrons is also a big problem. Live band is ok,not great. Staff available to wait on tables is seriously limited. Overall we ate soup and appetizer but then moved downstairs to Cascade for main course. To summarize - food is excellent, a tad pricey. Setting is poor in terms of layout and decor. Smoking is a big turn off. Potential to become a hit among couples but still a lot of distance to cover....",3,"2019-02-23 09:21:02",1,1,0

"56095376","It‚Äôs been a while since I stayed at a Radisson hotel and was completely awestruck. Happened year and I was disappointed to actually leave.
Everything right from the service, rooms, the food, aesthetics were perfect! The rooms are really large, I actually enquired which category of room I was in because I thought I had got a business class room going by the amenities and size of the room.
The hotel has some great dining options and each restaurant is more beautiful than the other. It‚Äôs also amazing how competitively their menus are priced! It‚Äôs cheaper to dine at the hotel than to go to a nice restaurant in the roof top Which I think is a very wonderful Mexican and Brazilian decor strategy.
The staff is very warm and hospitable. They make an effort to make their guests feel special. Special thanks to two of their chef dayal , nihal. Doma Resaption manager mr sumit for their personal touch!",5,"2019-01-02 19:13:09",1,3,1
"8007021","My husband and I bought the voucher for the New Year Party 2019 in the terrace but unfortunately my husband got a sports injury the same morning. He couldn‚Äôt stand for long durations because of the leg injury. We attended the terrace party thinking we wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay for long. 
But, inspite of the rush and festivities the Manager Mr.Sunil Kumar Mohapatra quickly arranged a seating for us at a different party location and helped us out. We appreciate his quick thinking and coordination with his colleagues for making the necessary arrangements so smoothly and quickly. We were able to stay and enjoy the party till 12:30 because of this timely help. 
The venue was excellent as usual, the staff were kind and welcoming, the food selection was delicious and the presentation was simple and elegant exactly the way I like it. The pool looked amazing in the beautiful lights and great music to match the mood. ",5,"2019-01-02 16:13:21",14,7,0

"32792467","Well I wouldn't term it as a Mexican cuisine joint that I fell in love with. I would just term it ok. So let's start with a bit of detail -
1. Ambience - it looks more like a space they had and wanted to use it to earn. There is nothing charming about this roof top place and decor is also just ok.
2. Food - ordered a chicken fajita and New Zealand lamb chops. Fajita's tortilla was sad, looked more like a crispy flour roti. Guacamole was a paste unlike the clunkiness you should have it and more importantly the taste was completely off. Sour cream was better though. Chicken was dry and rice was a pass. Now for the lamb chops, they were definitely decent of not falling off the bone great.
3. Price - well it's Radisson so they command a price for their brand, but frankly for 1700 bucks for lamb chops and 950 for chicken fajita, I wouldn't spend again there.
4. Service - probably the only thing that didn't fail. Courteous, attentive staff and fast service.
Overall, you can have much better food and ambience for lesser price.",2,"2018-12-30 22:32:17",52,54,0

Firstly thank you for all the love on the previous reviews and pictures.
Let me start by introducing the name and venue of the new place I visited second time
Ô∏èVenue Ô∏è-
5/5
ambience 4.5/5
A very Mexican type of ambience, with a vibrant red colur and brown colour combination. The seating arrangement is done very smart way,comfortable sofas as well as bar stools are available.. So you can choose accordingly where ever you wanna be seated...
Service
5/5
The staff attended us very well, they suggested us accordingly what to eat what's their speciality... One more thing I observed about all the staff was that, they all were well qualified for the job they were doing... All the servers had knowledge about the different food items as well as the drinks and cocktails being served.... As well as all the servers as well as managers were doing all the jobs,one our table we had the head staff pick up plates, which was very rare to see. They looked after everything on our table very efficiently. They appeared to be very jolly and energetic people.. Which adds brownie points to the place.. It's always good to see happy people around.
And I have to mention few names who added to the happy time spent. Mr Laxmi Kant Mr rohite and Mr chef nihal were very courteous and treated us very well.
Starters
1.mexican style nacho - we had chicken wings crisper, crispy shrimps and potato skin... You can choose accordingly.
2.mix and match fajitas - grilled chicken and grilled chicken mixed with onions and capsicum with four soft tortillas and a very orderly served Mexican rice , two types of lettuce, and sauces... The fajitas was very tasty. I made my own fajitas according to my taste.
3.crumb Fried fish and chips, can't explain the mouth watering fish, and chips... They served two huge pieces of fish chunks with fries...
I have to mention the dips which was served... Theres was tarter sauce dip, mustard and honey dip, which was my personal favorite.
Drinks -
1.mexican sunset
2.whiskey lemonade
Deserts -
1.sizzling brownie with ice cream.
The Browne was actually very sizzling... The brownie I ate here was by far the best brownie I've eaten.. The ice cream and brownie were Melting in the mouth.
Overall this place was amazing, do visit if you want your taste buds to taste something Tex mexHelpful?

"74259925","I visited this place last month with my family¬† and really enjoyed my time there. I visited it tonight after it was really amazing place¬†
Not a lot of people around when we came. Just another table or 2 filled. There is some incomprehensible english music¬† in the background (thankfully not loud enough to drown out conversations). The ambiance is quite colorful and that's what I would expect from a mexican restaurant.
We had ""Atomic nachos "" For appetizers. It tasted good, crespy and a tope of layering cheese but it tasted good anyway. I think my wife¬† has the grilled chicken (fajita )which is made by chef and grilled prawns. To taste a wonderful¬† of everything, I had the Veg tacos¬† (1 mexican rice, 1 chimichanga and 1 soft¬† shell taco)
The veg tacos¬† i had was brilliant. The taco was cripsy and yummy. the mexican rice was flavorful, the right amount and the chimichanga though I had late¬†
Although one of my friends said in terms of quantity the grill items might be to more but need to reduce¬†¬†

The food is typical Mexican Brazilian so would be kind of bland. We started with bread rolls n sweet bun which were kindoff okaish. The chicken soup was nice and the only thing close to spicy. The chicken wings were amazingly tender and delicious.
The main course had Mexican rice served with fish, lamb and chicken. I liked the fish much more than the other two.
The evening ended with banana cake crowned with an icecream which made for an apt climax for an evening well spent.

Very minimal staff not even bothered to attend you. Even in fixed course of menu, u need to wait for nearly 15 mins for the next dish to be served and also the food was not at all satisfactory.

Only very few items in the menu are from the Brazilian cuisine. The two we tasted, the cheese breads and coxinhas were not particularly good, specially given the very expensive price tag. Everything else range from bad to mediocre. The Brazilian rice and beans is outrageous given its lack of resemblance to what is actually cooked in Brazil. Deserts were small and we received liquid ice cream in one of them. Although the view is beautiful, service was not particularly courteous and the overall experience was extremely underwhelming.

The roof top restaurant of raddisson is a beautiful place to unwind at the poolside after a hectic day of work. One of the only few places which i personally love visiting. I was invited here to try their new oktoberfest menu which was launched in September. The ambiance no doubt is pretty impressive , i was more excited and curious about the food. So we started our dinner with bread basket which mainly consisted of sunflower seed bread with some amazing dips. Then came the chicken sausage soup which had chicken sausages, onions, tomato and carrot added to it. One of the best chicken sausages soups i ever had. I liked it so much that, i gulped down two portions of it. Some of the items in the menu which i really relished were tomato and pineapple sauce, coconut fish, non veg platter, choco pudding and linzer torte. out of all the dishes, coconut fish was my star. The tender fish with coconut chunks and aroma to die for. A perfect delectable delicacy for the chilled night. I truly enjoyed being here. The staff and service was on point.

Pool side set up on the terrace of Radisson Hi-Tech city.. it's a perfect place to unwind after a days work or on a windy evening with your friends.. 
The assorted bread basket platter consisting of pretzels , sunflower seed bread , landbrot served with paprike butter was a perfect companion for kohlsuppe (cabbage soup ). Cabbage soup this good was beyond my imagination. 
Apple and fennel salad with lettuce was perfect .
Though the regular menu doesn't have anything for vegetarians in the main course. The chef was kind enough to serve Brazilian rice tomato flavour rice with kidney beans.  The grilled paneer cottage cheese steak made me fall in love with it. Though the pieces were huge in size the marination was perfect . The flavour was very well soaked . Properly grilled on all the sides . Creamy mashed potatoes , oven slow roasted potatoes , maple glazed pumpkins and steamed veggies along with mushroom form the perfect sides for the main course. 
From the compact mocktails menu I enjoyed sipping virgin colada . 
Warm choco pudding as the name suggest was served warn with vanilla ice cream. Linzer torte was like a perfect desert just a bit sweet but goes well with beer . The mild flavour of cinnamon just added to it's flavour..

"125714","Hit to Chama Gaucha when you are looking for a cozy roof top and pool side setup in a star property. It‚Äôs Hyderabad‚Äôs first Brazilian churrascaria bringing you the centuries-old South America‚Äôs taste. When translated from Portuguese, Chama (Flame) is the essence of every Brazilian Steakhouse echoing the passion of Gauchos (Waiters) for their tradition and food. The waiters are supposed to move from table to table and serve different types of grilled meats by cutting the slices directly to the plate from the skewers.
Radisson is celebrating the spirit of #OktoberFest with delectable German food paired with fine selection of Beers. For Vegetarians, pricing for the fest is on a higher side. The set menu with unlimited Beer costs around Rs 2500++ or it could be ordered individually as well. 
The alluring platter of freshly baked Breads couldn‚Äôt have been a better start in the breezy environment. The assortment had Pretzels, Pide, Landbrot, and Paprika Soft Roll and each of them was delicious in its own way. The Tapenade, Saffron, and Paprika Butter served along made it difficult not to overload myself with carbs.
Next came the Kohlsuppe Soup, a mild and refreshing cabbage broth with just right amount of herbs and spices, so light on the tummy that I could eat every day. Apple Fennel with a base of crispy lettuce, seasoning delicious enough to nourish your body and your taste-buds prepared us for our next course of food. 
My fellow food blogger and I saw each other in disappointment when Cottage Cheese with a side of exotic veggies and Brazilian rice was served to us as a main-course. But, when we tasted the steak, little did we know about its deeply infused peri-peri flavor that just melted away as we took a bite. The mashed potatoes with a tinge of garlic, maple glazed pumpkin, cherry tomatoes, and oven-slow roasted potato attributed to plethora of flavors and at that moment, all I wanted was solitude to sink in the experience. 
Just when my senses were returning, Warm Choco Pudding and Linzer Torte made an appearance and were literally growing on me with every bite. The decadent chocolate pudding and in-house ice-cream was mesmerizing for vegetarians at-least. Linzer Torte deriving excessive sweetness from the Jam was bit off but the tiny cinnamon bites made a gracious attempt to balance the taste. 
The mocktails were just right, what you generally get at such places and nothing extra-ordinary. The dominating artificial flavors in my Virgin Mojito irked me, rest no complains.
The service was such that it elevated the dining experience to a new level. The Servers were not only attentive but took immense care while we were juggling between two tables to click pictures. The turn-around time was quick which reflects the co-ordination within themselves. The interaction with Chef Sunil Sunkavalli and the Management exuded warm vibe and their knowledge on the cuisine and concept left us impressed.",4,"2017-09-16 02:16:44",149,1676,20

Chama Gaucha, Labanese and Brazilian Grill restaurant, located on the roof top of Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City, is a beautiful, breezy roof-top place by the swimming pool - a place you would go to after a long day at work for a couple of drinks.
Since I was invited for the Oktoberfest promotion, needless to say, beers like Stella Artois, Hoegaarden formed the most important part of the evening. 
Cabbage Soup that came along with assorted breads was great. Apple and Fennel salad was good too. Grilled cottage cheese platter came along with a portion of mushrooms and creamy mashed potato. While paneer was great, mashed potatoes had no flavor and had no salt. 
Overall, it is a nice place. Service is very slow and it isn't an ideal place for a quick meal.instagram.com",3.5,"2017-09-09 17:17:21",279,1947,8
"260065","Chama Gaucha (which literally means ‚ÄúFlames of the South American Cowboys‚Äù) is the rooftop restaurant which brings Brazilian food for the first time to Hyderabad. Located at the rooftop next to the swimming pool and Velocity bar, the al-fresco seating overlooks the open kitchen. Churrasco in Brazilian is essentially barbecued meat, and the restaurant specializes in this. A churrascaria grill has been installed in the kitchen to prepare South American style barbecue. The imported meat grilled in the kitchen uses select South American spices and marinades.
Apart from Brazilian the restaurant serves Lebanese cuisine too. Mezze platters, falafels, shawarmas and shish touks as well as sweets like Basbousa and Baklava are all available. 
At a bloggers table, the restaurant served some signature dishes from the menu. We started with some bread varieties served on the table, the highlight of which was Pao de Quijo, a small and round Brazilian cheese bread. Mezze‚Äôs (hummus, labneh and moutabel served with pita bread) and couple of salads were next. 
Among the starters, Chicken Shish Touk and Fried Camaroes (crispy fried panko prawns) impressed. However the main dish from Churrascaria was Coxa De Frango, chunky chicken pieces marinated in a Brazilian sauce and grilled. The chicken, served along with rice and Abacaxi Assado (honey glazed grilled pineapple) was excellent.
On our request, the chef prepared some Australian Lamb Churrasco. The meat from the skewer was directly served on the plate. The rock salt rubbed on the meat made the preparation a bit salty and the meat in my opinion was a tad overdone, but still I liked the smoky flavoured dish.
The place also serve pizzas, pastas and burgers, of which we tried the Chef‚Äôs Special XXX Burger with fillings of roasted chicken and chicken salami.
The dinner ended with Dulce De Teche Tiramisu, which lacked the coffee flavour. 
I would revisit the place for mainly the grills. A few dishes on my radar are Costeleta De Porco (Belgian pork chops) and Seared Lemon Tuna.

"319205","Chama Gaucha is setup as an open-air lounge on the terrace of Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City. I was invited to a tasting session featuring signature dishes pre-selected by the Chef. As I settled in, I was offered the Grande Bastardo. This turned out to be a fantastic concoction of Bourbon and White Chocolate that paired beautifully with Camaroes - fried panko crusted prawns marinated in garlic white wine sauce and spiced with peri peri. ¬†Acaraje, a traditional Brazillian street food, is another great pub grub and the succulent Chicken Sheesh Touk from the Mediterranean grills was also quite impressive.
We were served two dishes from the Brazillian gril - Coxa de Cordeiro and Coxa de Frango. The former is grilled Australian leg of lamb while the latter is grilled Chicken legs. A Churrasco is traditionally beef, so I was a bit disappointed to not see it being featured at Radisson. Nevertheless, the Chicken was grilled beautifully and I loved the simple rock salt and paprika rub. The lamb meat was evidently of very good quality, but it was woefully overcooked and also high on salt. The final dish of the evening, Tiramisu, was also a disappointment. It lacked the lovely bitterness of coffee.
The Brazillian grills are clearly meant to be the main draw of Chama Gaucha. Unfortunately, even after two visits, I didn't taste anything from the Churrascaria that made me go 'Wow'. Go there for the ambience and the drinks that are ably complemented by the appetisers, but don't expect too much from the Churrascaria.hydfoodguy.com",3.5,"2017-07-08 19:12:52",128,1095,3

"1200867","Radisson has opened its door to a brand new restaurant and guess what it serves Brazilian cuisine! Yes you just read that. South American cuisine is slowly but steadily becoming a trend among the epicureans and my gut feeling says that it is here to stay.
Located on the terrace of Radisson, Gachibowli this fine dine restaurant boasts of an open air ambience accentuated with embalming yet incandescent lighting and not to forget the overlooking pool and live music. Yes the ambience is set.
Now coming over to the food we ordered Abacaxi Assado- Pineapple, Cottage Cheese, Arroz Brasiliero, Coxa de Frango which was from their Churrascaria section and we concluded the meal with Cua de Banana and Basbousa.
To begin with each of the items had something new to offer thanks to the ingredients that were unique to Brazil and hence was a welcome departure from anything I have tried before. I especially liked the way how Abacaxi Assado was served. The presentation was immaculate and impeccable.
But what stayed with me is the service. Yes this is something I would want to emphasise on we felt like we were being cordially taken care of and that is what I find is their USP. The chef would actually be more than happy to explain you each of the items and the ingredients that went into it.
Oh yes we were also pampered with complimentary üòÉ
The restaurant also serves alcohol.
This fine dine is a must visit and we must appreciate Radisson for gifting food lovers with the taste of Brazil.",4.5,"2016-12-09 11:49:11",103,464,10

Radisson Gachibowli has come up with South American (Brazilian) cuisine, probably the first in Hyderabad and Lebanese to add to the menu which is no new to Hyderabadis. This, however is their honest attempt to get the authentic flavors to the Pearl City. Chama means flame of passion- the true essence of authentic brazilian steak house (source : internet) , which on a whole means the passion and authenticity that they carry in food and service. Did they deliver it ? Lets find out.
Ambience : This Casual dine, pinned to the pool, does look amazing in their decor. As of now, this place is open for dinners. One can enjoy a candle light dinner along with a new feel of Pool Side with this new cuisine.
Price Factor: This place is located in a star hotel property, Radisson. Expect it to be pricey. Easily a meal could cost you anywhere between 2000-3000 for 2.
This food session was a bloggers table, invited by the restaurant and was on the house. Below review is true to taste and honest in the interest of fellow foodies and restaurant.
Food :
Most of the dishes are prepared with Rock Salt and not the salt that we use daily. Though it tastes pretty much like salt, it's very much subtle when compared to it.
Welcome Drink - Kiwi Crush : Blend of kiwi juice and sprite, tasted good. However, from such a place, I have expected a better mocktail make.
Bread Board - Bread board is one complimentary dish for all the cutomers who visit their restaurant ( this is what I was told), not sure it is for initial period or could be everytime. It had array of breads which had Brazilian Cheese Bread which is made of paramesan Cheese, turkish Pede Bread, Ciabatta an italian wheat flour bread served with butter,cashew & spice sauce and olive & broccoli sauce. I liked the breads and when dipped in sauces they were tasty.
Pita Breads served with Hummus, labneh,moutabel,tabouleh and marinated olives.
Pita Breads This was beyond words. Probably the best dish I have liked in the whole dinner spread. Very soft that it almost melts in your mouth. It also had their restaurant stamp on it, which looked quite good.
Hummus which is made of boiled chickpea tasted nothing great and could have been better.
Labneh made of yogurt soaked for 2 days along with cream cheese, added to it are garlic paste and lemon tasted good with pita.
Motabel made of egg plants and juice of onions and tomatoes was an okish affair.
Olives served had different varities of it. Green , black and a very rare available kalama olives.
Falafel a common dish in hyderabad if you had lebanese before which is made with overnight soaked chickpeas , garlic, coriander and spring onion did not carry the proper taste and felt that it might need more flavors/spices to make it better.
Coxinha De Frango is a Brazilian appetizer made of chicken mixed with mayo and cooked with flour topped over it to make it fried serve. This cooking process takes about 7 hours to bring out the authentic one and I loved it (y), among others.
Coxa De Frango was another Chicken serve which is made of grilled chicken leg piece, could have carried flavors much better.
Lamb Sheesh Kebab and Fattoush Salad were an OK affair and nothing great.
Cox De Cordeiro made of lamb (not sure if the name is correct) was a bit chewy and were not able to enjoy it for the same reason.
Cottage Cheese , Potato Wedges and Broccoli were fresh and tasty. There was however a lack of 'WOW' factor here.
Baked Pasta and Arroz Brasileiro ( Brazilian bean rice ) were also okish and havent found much of awesomeness in it.
Desserts:
Basbousa - A middle Eastern (lebanse) sweet serve, made of cooked semolina dipped in syrup and also called as semolina cakes, tasted good.
Tiramisu - coffee flavored Italian custard dessert made of mascarpone cheese and cocoa tasted delicious.
Service : Servers are polite and have good knowledge of the dishes. No downs here.
Thank You Prashansa Shahani for the hospitality and special thanks to Chefsunil Sunkavalli for his patience in answering my never ending questions about the recipes :)
Bottom Line: Though most of the food experience was okish, it is still in its early stages to judge. There were few hits and misses, however, after the enthu and passion that I have seen with Chef, I'm sure this place is soon gonna rock. All the best team :)",3.5,"2016-11-26 21:08:41",309,1998,32
