"60984746","Place for regular kind of food... Ghar Jaisa !
Ordered Upma Dosa, Plain Dosa & Sambar Idly.
Received all with Chatni except Samber with idli in well packed and decently hot conditions.
It is seen that when Dosa and all is ordered for delivery, it gets little damp and crispiness/freshness goes away. While the packaging was good thus it assured proper fresh delivery.
Upma, Dosa and Idly all were reasonably priced, up-to mark and tasted like regular home like food with not much spices. This restaurant is thus good for regular ordering. However can't say much when guests are around.
