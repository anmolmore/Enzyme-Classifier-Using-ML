I have tried many flavors here but one of my favorite is Belgium chocolate..the texture was really soft and chocolate taste was damn awesome..Have also tried almond caramel but that was average in taste..

I never ever thought of wasting an ice cream, but splish splash made me to do so. Disappointed with splish splash. ",3.5,"2017-08-01 09:52:15",189,1486,3

"20411590","Tried various stuff from here and have had hits and misses..In the icecreams, Bavarian chocolate is really good. Banana strawberry, splish splash & roses and cream are average...infact roses n cream is a let down! Artificial pink color n flavor.. Coming to the shakes.. mango berry magic is good...but no berries ðŸ˜œ its just mango and vanilla icecream with milk..but the generous scoop of Alphonso mango pulp and pieces make up for it. Two big chunks of Alphonso mango in each drink..yumminess! thearistochic.com",3.5,"2017-03-18 19:13:14",79,244,1

"452406","The usual classic Baskin Robbins taste. I don't think there's anymore to be said. One disappointment was the hot butterscotch topping. It solidified and ended up forming a chewy layer over the ice cream.",3.5,"2016-11-29 14:09:01",157,1107,3
