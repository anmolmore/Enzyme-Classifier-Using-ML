"85162820","one of the best stop place for vegetarian food. I often order dishes from same restaurant, the flavour is scrumptious n mouth watering. Neat and hygiene packing.",5,"2019-04-11 06:53:53",3,0,0
"49784030","The quantity??? Like seriously, with respect to the exorbitant prices you guys ask for, the quantity of aloo manchurian is meagre. Disappointed!!",2,"2019-04-02 15:11:29",3,3,0
"96877130","it was affordable and delivery was pretty fast.kaju butter masala was good,but kadai veg was not great.overall food and quantity were fine..",4,"2019-02-23 20:39:23",1,0,0
"257990","You will get good dhaba style food here with moderate price. What you will miss is the feel of fine dining experience though the place is setup according to that. If you just want to focus on food and price, it's a good place for you.Pretty neat place to have vegan food. The staff looked decent but service not good, they really need to work on it. May be the prepration of food items gets delayed so the waiters can't help. We had Paneer paratha with Boondhi raitha were good. We can specify our required spicy levels so that they can alter. The main thing you will get very fast is the bill

"55891493","Their Special Kaju Paneer Biryani is best, one must try that. I tried their Paneer curried as well & those were also awesome. The best thing about Hitex Santosh Dhaba is that they have many options in veg.",5,"2018-10-03 00:21:13",3,2,0

"678733","Can't understand such low ratings for this joint. I have had food from this place(mostly takeaway) umpteen number of times. Never had an issue. The veg food here tastes better than anything I have eaten in any north indian restaurant in hyderabad. All those fancy fine dining restaurants from the famous chain of restaurants in hyderabad with amazing ambience can't hold a candle to this place when it comes to sheer taste.¬† If not having non-veg from Paradise this is my fav place to go. The taste is simply outstanding and one can never go wrong. This is a no nonsense place and is frequented by families as well. Waiters will not speak english nor will they be in fancy uniform. If you have a problem with the ambience/service then better do a take away. Visit only if you are hungry.Having said all that I expect similar taste from all the copies of Santosh dhabas across hyderabad as they all follow same north indian dhaba format.And yes dhaba food is going to be oily, so its not for daily dining, for health conscious Subway is the place.",5,"2018-07-30 09:30:56",23,6,0
