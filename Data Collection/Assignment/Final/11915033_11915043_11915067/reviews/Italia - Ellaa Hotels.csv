"30026397","Visited this place on a Friday evening. It was empty. The ambience is great and the staff is amazing. Perfect for a quiet dinner with family.
We ordered a veg Lasagna and veg Pizza.
Lasagna was lip smacking delicious, but pizza could've been better.
The odd thing was that they charged 18% GST. When asked why, I was told it's because this restaurant is a part of a hotel. I did a quick search and found that this rule applies only to restaurants where the declared tariff of the accommodation exceeds Rupees 7500.",3,"2019-04-05 22:36:33",1,0,0

The ambience is beautiful, one of my favourites in Hyderabad. The food is a perfect 5 for me. The soups, spaghetti, grilled chicken were amazing. The pizza was okayish. If a happening place is not a constraint for you, this place is a must try!",5,"2019-03-22 00:57:17",56,276,0

"1066134","Pathetic Service and tasteless food. Cheap ticks in billing. They initially billed us for 7 people instead of 6(one of us was fasting so not having food). When we asked they brought a new bill for 6 with the same amount. When asking again, they charged us actual price. Go there only if u want to sit in a hot place with no AC and lights that hurt your eyes. I took 6 of my friend for a lunch which turned out to be a pathetic decision. Avoid this one.",1,"2013-08-02 16:07:04",1,0,0

I want to complain about the service we have got at Italia-Ella Hotels. Its really pathetic to say that, i have never experienced such Worst service ever in my life not even at a road side dhaba.
We were all 7 friends who visited Italia-Ella Hotels Yesterday. First upon visiting Waiter named sudhir, he asked if we have any vouchers. When i have handed him vouchers he just asked to wait. After one minute he came back & said as we havn't made any reservations we can leave from the place & can come back next day. I asked him whats the problem when their is no one in the restaurant & not even any of the table is ocuupied by other guest he can serve us. But he was like no i cant serve u today.
After that i said him that i want to talk to your manager for which he was reluctant & wasn't calling the manager. After i forced him he instead of calling the manager he called some other waiter who said that we can have dinner but it will take some time to serve us. We were ok with that.
When we ordered Soup & starters, we found that many of the items are not available. After that some other guest also came & ordered the food. To our surprise their order came with in half n hour where as our first order soup arrived only after 1hour. And over to that, one of the soup was containing excess salt. when i asked him about it he bluntly said, this soup will be like this only. After that our drinks(Cocktails) were served in which alcohol was absolutely missing. We were feeling like we have ordered Mocktails instead of cocktails. 
Finally after 90 minutes he served Starters & Main course at the sametime. Again we have asked why starters & Main course is being served at the same time again he bluntly said, it is served like this only at this place. which forced one my friend to raise his voice 7 asked him again to call the manager to which he bluntly refused again and took back the main course finally to bring it later. Then we have asked him to bring the Bread sticks two times but he didnt cared to bring. 
The starters were containing just cut vegetables with nothing except salt & pepper in it. Finally after we asked him to bring the main course which arrived after 20 minutes. which was really having a rotten taste of veggies n cheese. We havn't ate that also expecting atleast deserts would be good. But again not to our surprise, pastry which was served was very hard to eat. 
We were at the hotel to bid a farewell to one of our friend who was leaving to delhi. But this Restaurant completely spoiled everyone's mood & evening & taste. I recommend any1 never to visit such restaurant where they have such pathetic, irresponsible & Stubborn Management. Sudheer you were the most worst attender i have never seen in my life.
Its not like i have visited this restaurant for the first time. i have been here before & enjoyed the food & hospitality thats why we friends decided to celebrate at italia. But after this i will never visit this ella hotel Nor recommend any1 to visit it.
Never expected such kind of hospitality in a star rated hotel.",1,"2012-02-18 15:12:49",2,79,0
