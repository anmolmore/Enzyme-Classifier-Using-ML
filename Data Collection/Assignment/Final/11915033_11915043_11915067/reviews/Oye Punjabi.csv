"52137531","Delivery Review:
Ordered Chana Masala, though it was cooked properly but had so much masala in it that I had to drink 2 glasses of lassi after that.
A restaurant food doesn't mean that it necessarily should have alot of masala.
Also the quantity was so less for 80 RS.",1,"2019-04-30 20:52:10",84,368,0
"52392029","I have ordered Shahi Paneer, Dal fry and Roti, they were decent enough for the price. Dal fry was spicy and Shahi Paneer I expected a better one, but compromised for the price. Overall this is a budget restaurant for quick food. ",3,"2019-04-14 09:51:17",12,3,0
"29282923","Good Lassi, pathetic food. I had ordered Shahi Paneer, Phulka and Lassi. Phulka reminded me of home and Lassi was great but the Shahi Paneer was so bad that it's just not acceptable from a restaurant with ""Punjabi"" in the name. It tasted a mix of tangy and chilly. Either they don't know how Shahi paneer is made or they messed up and sent something else. Either way the paneer was so bad I had to throw it away.",1,"2019-04-03 22:28:15",55,139,0
"52721752","I ordered shahi paneer in the hope that it will be good but it was a huge disappointment after seeing the quantity and the taste. It was a below average dish and i also specified that make it spicy but it was not even a bit spicy. Tasted like they forgot to put spices while making this. Very poor experience.",2,"2019-02-16 21:07:33",24,8,1
"1071070","Paratha isn't my field.. I can say they tasted nice.. But My Delhi friend approved this place‚Äôs parathas.. So these have to be good..  üò¨üòÄ
the thick lassi was huge in quantity and was very filling.. It's a pocket friendly place that I recommend trying..  üëç
Ambiance should be improved though..

"39176993","Nearest to the north indian parathas that I ever had in Hyderabad. Lassi is thick and tasty. Located on old mumbai highway near Gachibowli flyover... this place gives little look of a dhaba... but there is very limited seating and little to no parking space. I would highly recommend this place if someone is fond of parathas :)",4,"2018-11-29 07:50:56",43,23,2
