Biryani was delivered in a pot packed in cardboard box.

"1071070","I did not know this place until I watched the 'Streetbyte's video on top ten best biryanis in Hyderabad.. Thankful to the video now.. üòÑ
We ordered veg biryani and chicken pot biryani from here.. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the biryani is sent along with the pot.. The packaging was good.. üëç 
Coming to the taste, I think it is one of the best authentic pot biryanis in Hyderabad.. The flavors were really nice.. The rice was white in color but still had the rich flavor.. The quantity is good enough for 2 people.. I plan to visit it again to try the other items.. 
My friend said that the veg biryani was not bad.. I Did not taste it though..

"49144175","Can definitely bet on pot biryani from Deepak Edla's Kitchen.
One of a kind and no competition of it in entire town....biryani is prepared in small pots, enough for two. And the highlight is ""each biryani pot is cooked separately"". Yes you read it right. Too much hard work goes into serving perferct and pocket friendly biryani.",5,"2018-06-07 14:10:52",105,1870,7

"7873691","Today is one regular Friday when I skip lunch from home and rely completely on Zomato. Wanted to get back to Deepak Edla for his signature biryanis. Left a note, ""Make it a little bit spicy"" with the order.
Order arrived on time. Packaging was amazing. Microwave safe box (My mom wouldn't have thrown the box away after eating). Food was piping hot. Biryani was colorful and Juicy. In fact I was surprised by the amount of Chicken in it. On my note, they made it a bit spicy. Raita and Masala are rich, thick and yummmy.
Deepak Edla's never fail to amaze me. Thanks ZOMATO for APR50.",5,"2018-04-13 14:52:25",3,28,0

Heard alot about this one . I have ordered Veg biryani and my God the quality and quantity were both more than satisfying to me .
