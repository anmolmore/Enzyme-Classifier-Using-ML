"99108722","Nice place with good ambience .
The best Hyderabadi cuisine .
It's a foodies joint , well mannered staff .
Arabian food and the seating is too good and very different from what I have so far experienced .
The Banquets are too good and can accommodate 150 to 200 people . We had a good time celebrating a close friends birthday party at Mehraan Restaurants.
Thankyou Mehraan for taking care of us so well .",5,"2019-05-03 20:35:25",1,2,1
