"403506","I love Sippy Monks. Its not big or fancy, it is a cosy set up with staff that makes you feel absolutely at home. Their drinks are great and the whole board game, comfy sofa bit makes it a great hangout to chill. The only thing i wish it had better was ventilation. It can get a bit stuffy at times.

Will order drinks for next time. The name is also very trippy.. But very good drinks... I must say well planned. ",4,"2018-06-20 10:45:52",92,2303,0
"56680309","I love Sippy monks because there are so many vegan options. My favourite is pista shake and that the take aways are given with glass bottles. ",5,"2018-06-18 15:26:21",2,1,0
"35836801","I have order once or twice from this place. They have coconut based shakes and mocktails which is quite a unique thing.
Recently tried coco falooda and caramel delight choco shake.
Both were refreshing and tasty.",4,"2018-04-30 16:30:14",247,316,0
"30532658","Its one of the best places I have seen in recent past. Drinks are really unique made of tender coconut milk and mocktails with coconut water which is one of the Kind.
Drinks are really tasty and the flavour of Coconut water is preserved along with other flavours.
Food 5/5
Ambience 5/5
Service 4/5
Must try: Oreo Milkshake and Coco Falooda
And yeah they are giving free popcorn.",5,"2018-04-18 09:19:01",35,108,0
"462469","my first order was smelling a bit odd (it's a familiar smell of spoilt/fermented coconut water) and pomogranate flavour did not come thou it was a combo of coconut and pomegranate",2.5,"2018-04-08 00:28:21",10,100,0
