"38021566","Good service. Pocket friendly. Lot of variety. Must visit for ice cream lovers.
Tried the almond chocolate scoop and the chocolate grill. Loved them both.",5,"2018-10-04 06:07:16",77,305,2
"47851579","Visited the place today after a very long time. Tried their fruits & nuts overload grill and choco hazelnut swirl. Few of the ingredients were unavailable and they did not mention it upfront when asked but when asked why they were missing in the ice cream they showed so much attitude. Don't intend to visit again unless I don't have a choice.",2.5,"2018-02-24 18:39:44",40,78,0
"1361020","Interesting place Kwality Walls has developed -  like a Subway for sandwiches, DIY ice-creams. 
The Chill Grill pre-made menu is quite satisfying. If you wish to proceed with your own choices, then it all relies on your own taste. 
A number of toppings, a few sauces and a decent set of ice-cream flavours are available for your to experiment. Though this particular outlet ran out of most flavours I loved. Even then, it was an interesting tryout, and the guy behind the table was quite friendly. 
Try asking him for a generous dose of toppings off the table, and he won't mind. At 135 bucks, it is quite a steal. ",3.5,"2016-07-28 11:53:39",137,1011,0
