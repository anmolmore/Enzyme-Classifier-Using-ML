"35864721","As part of a review event, received chocolate decadence, chocolate fantasy and pancakes. The best was Chocolate Decadence out of all, too yum it was, heavenly actually. Pancakes were good too. Superb packaging and on time delivery, glad I gave it a shot.",4,"2019-05-12 12:02:35",208,771,0
"16142730","Sweet truth is usually my go to resort whenever I have cravings for something chocolaty!
This time i experimented with more items, and not just chocolate!
Red velvet slice and cheese cake - It was so smooth and made to perfection. I don't like when people over do the cheese and i can taste less of red velvet, but it was the right proportion.
Chocolate fantasy - Choco lava cake at its best. I really want to visit the store and have it hot sometime. The chocolate amount inside it is crazy, and it's my favorite there.
Pancakes - The pancakes were served with chocolate dip and blueberry jam. I am a fan of blueberry, so a +1 for that. The pancakes were a little thick and got a little hard. However the dips were perfect.
So, preferably avoid to order pancakes.
Looking forward to try more! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,"2019-04-16 12:42:55",166,977,0

An outlet that does justice to it's quirky name by serving up some great desserts appealing to those with a Sweet Tooth and a Sweet Truth.üòâ
As part of the review program, I was entitled to two cakes out of their vast selection of sweets. I ordered:
üç∞ CHEESECAKE (180) - A slice of thick and dense cheesecake, baked well. Juicy and packed with good flavor, didn't smell. Sweetness was slightly over the top.
üç∞ CHOCOLATE DECADENCE (160) - Chocolate pastry/ cake topped with a creamy layer and some butter scotch. My pick of the two.
The cakes were packaged well however the chocolate cake faced a lateral displacement within the parcel. Taste was on point, however for what was offered I felt them to be on the pricier side.
Variety in menu has Gulab Jamun, Gulkand shots, Red Velvet and a large range of combos.
Here's my overall SCORE:
Food - 4/5
VFM - 3/5",4,"2018-09-01 00:23:35",145,3376,2
"95935","The chocolate decadence and cheesecake combo is perfect for trying out both headline dessert options.
The cheesecake was very good, no fuss, no add-on flavours, just plain old cheesecake. Not complaining but if they expand their menu I would really like to see more variants (orange / cherry / lemon).
The chocolate decadence slice did not survive the delivery unharmed. Some of the chocolate had melted away and leaked out of the packaging. The taste, luckily, was preserved and it was the better of the desserts. Dark chocolate ganache and walnut kernel keep the dessert from being too sweet (or simple).
Definitely recommended for people with a sweet tooth.",4,"2018-08-21 21:39:52",125,751,2

Chocolate Fantasy and chocolate decadence. Packing looks good. I got 5 pieces of chocolate which was choco lava which was really rich with chocolate and real sweet when I had the first bite it was like a chocolate blast in my mind loved it to the core.

Cheese cake made my day. This is without a doubt the best cheese cake I have ever had. You just can't stop at one bite.
Chocolate descent: It was also amazing. It's texture from inside is like a chocolate Cheesecake. And sponge cake from the bottom with thick chocolate Ganache layer on the top. And further topped with Walnuts. The best part it was not very sweet. Just write amount of sweet, not overpowering the chocolate taste.

I can say that this was the best red velvet cake I ever tasted in our twin cities. It was just awesome. The cake was delivered on time thanks to Zomato.
Every layer of this red velvet cake was dripping with such fine taste that each of my colleagues now just swear by this cake. I am not sure why the outlet has stopped accepting orders from Zomato and why the red velvet cake is no longer on their menu. They can attract a huge crowd thanks to this one cake.

"1366361","Well ! finally got a chance to try out their cheesecake Courtesy of a review program and trust me they taste absolutely perfect.
I don't like overly sweet stuff and the cheesecake was bang on the right amount of sweetness for me . The crust was perfectly baked and the best part is it's totally value for money. The size of the cheesecake is double of what you get at any dessert shop but at a lesser price than them.
I did order these twice after this so yes they are superb.

The chocolate fantasy was a chocolate lava cake. I got it hot so the melted chocolate was oozing out when I cut it open and it was really yummy.
The chocolate decadence which was a dark chocolate pastry with almonds tossed on top of it was yummy too.
The cheesecake was not my favorite mainly because I kind of have a love hate relationship with it. It really has to be exceptional for me to love it. In this case, though it was good, it wasn't exceptional. The other two were really good and worth a try for everyone. ",4,"2018-03-18 20:28:52",73,625,2

"35733175","I wish I knew this place earlier as the kind of pastries and other delicacies they serve were lip smacking and ideally made üòä
I was approached by the food tasting program and selected a Cheesecake and Chocolate Fantasy.
This review is unbiased and honest.
The items were ready and was handed over on time in a good packaging which is appreciated.
CheeseCake : I have tried a lot of Cheesecakes and trust me this was one of the best I had eaten so far.
I could easily make out from the taste that it was freshly made as the Philadelphia cheese and sour cream was found naturally fresh.
Also the crust layer was well made and had a good flavor to the addition.I suggest the baker  to keep the Cheesecake in a refrigerator for at least 5 hours so that it becomes intact as mine was falling apart and that‚Äôs the only ‚Äúflaw‚Äù I found.
Chocolate Fantasy : I had this earlier at Dominos and had known this as Choco Lava.
It was still hot when it was served and I could taste the freshness of it.
Also, it was ideally baked as it wasn‚Äôt sticky from the edges and came out smoothly.
The flavors were well balanced and tasted delightful.
Final Verdict :
Food : 4
Packaging : 4
Value for Money : 4",4,"2018-03-15 09:47:41",57,1011,2

Sweet truth is definitely a place you can fulfil your cravings for sweet tooth . A best place for cakes . 
I have had the cheesecake, red velvet cake and chocolate decandance. 
#Cheesecake was very creamy smooth melting in the mouth piece. A must try. 
#RedVelvet was out of the world. The red velvet lava is just a bliss to your taste buds. 
#Chocolate decandance was a dark chocolate pastry with almonds on the top. Little less on sweetness as perfect as you get the whole cake. 
The packaging is great .

Pancake as perfectly cooked and has a bit of crunch in it, A layer of Honey and Chocolate sauce make it perfect for my Sweet tooth.¬† Red Velvet is everyone's favorite, Sweet Truth lost brownie point as it was not moist, but if i ignore it then it was a good red velvet cake to enjoy.

The Chocolate Fantasy was loaded with chocolate syrup and tasted good. Somehow I expected more of the cake part. The cheesecake on the other hand was soft and the crust just added to the taste. In my view it was a little on the sour side. Overall it was a good experience. There are a whole lot of other desserts that you might want to try.

"33503433","I received a food tasting invite from Sweet Truth. This place is another subsidiary of Faaso's huge expansions which include Faaso's, Behrouz Biryani, Firangi Bake. The Desserts on the zomato page looked heavenly but slightly pricey.
Service- Had ordered for the goodies at 12pm on 26/02 and was informed it will arrive at 12.30pm but it came at 12pm sharp. The delivery boy was polite and no qualms here at all. 5/5
Packaging- Faaso's has never failed to impress in terms of its packaging which is always top notch. I could keep the goodies in the fridge for a good 12 hours before savouring it. 4.5/5
Food/Desserts- I got the following yummies for my tasting-:
Chocolate Fantasy- This was a chocolate lava cake. If you like the Domino's Chocolate lava cake, then this is just a replica of the same. Yum. 4/5
Chocolate Decadent- A soft, moist and creamy chocolate pastry topped with walnuts and creamy layers which can actually make your day. Every bite was melt in the mouth and you won't believe that I savoured it after almost a good 12 hours of the delivery. It looks great as well and you can actually gift it to someone. Got two numbers of this. 4.5/5
Will I order from here again? Oh, I loved what I got which I found slightly expensive but getting Desserts delovered at your doorstep and that too yummy ones is not everyday and everywhere so, yes will order again.
