"2816136","Seriously the best Mexican food in town! This is really comparable to the Mexican rice bowls and burritos we have had in NYC! Great portion size, truly customisable, chicken, cottage cheese and peri peri potato as the filling options! Located in the parking lot in front of Dlf gate 2, one drawback: the guy is so hot selling that he travels a lot over the week, so you could probably miss him there if he is on a tour or an event! But it‚Äôs definitely worth the chase!!",5,"2018-03-25 13:06:06",142,352,3
"32494097","Ordered chicken salad bowl. Quantity and taste both was good. Packaging could have been better and needs improvement. Amount of chicken was also a bit less. Other than that really satisfied with the healthy salad bowl. Would recommend for sure.",4,"2018-03-13 21:53:37",73,625,1
"32159204","Good service, food is served quite quickly too. I came across this truck as part of the Food Truck Festival. It was an experiment. I tried the BBQ chicken burrito. Quite heavy, and filling. It was a tad bland. But, that's probably how burritos taste, I wouldn't know. It was a fairly good and new experience.",3.5,"2018-03-04 18:03:55",115,546,1
