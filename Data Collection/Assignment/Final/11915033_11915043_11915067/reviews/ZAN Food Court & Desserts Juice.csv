"34009097","After a decent meal, we had Pista Falooda which was really good. The only downside to the taste was the presence of the strong guava flavor (empowering, I would say). The quantity was great, the service was quick, please don't expect ambiance here. Enjoyed the tutti frutti topping! ",4,"2019-01-11 11:00:10",122,636,3
