"3214370","Peaceful place. Prompt service. Great food. But extremely limited menu.
The 3/5 is due to the inconvenience of applying Zomato gold.
I was told that the 1+1 offer is valid only on items in same ""section"". Considering the already limited menu this is was an inconsiderate stipulation. So if you are planning to use Zomato gold avail better option.",3,"2019-04-28 22:28:31",2,0,0

"114164","What to say the ambiance of the place is just too good. It gives a luxury feeling rather a kingly feeling. The variety of good in the buffet is very less. The taste is andhra style, so if you are planning for a north indian falvour in buffet u r wrong. The kabab paranthas are great at this place at the time of kabab parantha fest. Its a family place where u can have dinner in peace and calm. Afterall its a Hyatt restra so it is meant to be classy.
So guys have a great time at Deori.

"34553126","Deori, the specialty Indian restaurant at Hyatt Gachibowli is back with an amazing makeover.¬† Go local is the main draw ‚Äì right from the impressive d√©cor, accents sourced and created by Hyderabadi artists, to Indian home-style cuisine. And their Indian Night Buffet is definitely worth a visit. Priced at Rs1200 (plus tax), there‚Äôs an extensive variety of regional dishes to choose from ‚Äì be it soups like Murgh Badam ka Shorba; Tunde Kebabs and Achar Paneer Tikkka for starters, ten varieties of healthy and tasty salads and pachadis, and an equally tempting main course.

"272299","Deori has undergone some renovation and refurbishment and it looks pretty inviting. The Indian Night Buffet is sure to be a hit in Gachibowli area. It offers a scrumptious fare in very artistic settings. The Indian Night buffet brings regional Indian cuisine in a glossy avatar with a pickle bar, earthy artefacts and classical music and dance performances and a quaint in-house mithai shop open for retail! I personally loved the array of chutneys, papads and chaach. If you get Sarson ka saag and Bisi Bele Bhaath under one roof, who is complaining! The 4 live stations ensure hot food on your table. The mithai ghar is actually the show stopper. The Hyatt team has gone that extra mile to make a truly enchanting Indian meal experience with ingenuity and creativity!

"31872315","Nei Paruppu (daal), Vankaya batani kura, malabar fish curry, kosha mangsho, jhinge posto and many other fancy items were served to us as part of the bengali-south indian cuisine special. The spread, however fancy in names and looks was the simplest most humble of all meals that was both light on the stomach and rich on the palette. The brilliance of their spread is that it has a huge variety of pickles, chaat, chutney,curries, desserts, papads, salads and still every item is delicious and as a result, choices are tricky to make. On another night during my stay i tried the rajesthani-south indian cuisine that included gatte ki sabzi, kadhi and a very tasty laal maas. If you are planning a visit to Hyatt Gachibowli, this place will surely not disappoint you.",5,"2018-01-23 16:37:57",137,639,11
"15719328","This place does not live up to the mark of a ‚ÄúHyatt‚Äù. Though the staff is really courteous and the ambiance is good as well, the food itself is disappointing. Firstly, the zomato menu does not accurately reflect what they usually offer at the restaurant. They literally had like 10 items on the alacarte menu for veg and another 10 for non-veg. They had a decent buffet which was mostly south indian and they said that they keep shuffling the north indian cuisines with Punjabi, Mughlai, Kashmiri etc. In all fairness, when we expressed our concern that the alacarte menu did not reflect the zomato menu, they did say you can order whaever you need and the chef will oblige. 
We ended up going for the buffet. The starters were really good (the veg kabab and papdi chat were awesome) and the main course of south indian was decent too but the north indian varieties were just average.
I would suggest either completely shifting over to south Indian which happens to be your strong point or have a more extensive alacarte menu.

The place is very well decorated, coupled with the cutlery, decor, music, everything screams Indian.
The food was good... Probably 4.5 on 5. Good variety. I happened to visit on a day when the theme was Rajasthani (and I am from Rajasthan). The choices, specially in chats and dessert was good.
Malpua was ordinary, but other things were fab.
A lot of minor details were well taken care of, to make the cuisine authentic...for e.g. some chutneys, the fried home made style chips were all things I have grown up eating at home regularly. They did a good job of presenting a very good buffet. ",4.5,"2017-12-31 13:08:48",34,233,0

Good ambience
Good service. Staff is courteous.
Food taste is good.
Desserts section is good and unique.
Cons:
1. They have split restaurants serving Indian and western/Asian food. So you will not get dishes found in most buffet like noodles.
2. Considering price verity in starter is very less especially if you are vegetarian like me.

"288005","We were staying at this hotel Hyatt over the last weekend. After a refreshing and relaxing Swedish massage, we decided to have dinner at their restaurant Deori - one because of the Indian cuisine and other because of live gazals. We werevery hungry by then.
As soon as we entered, we were served with some complimentary Papads accompanied with green chutney and pickle. We ordered Rasam and enjoyed every bit of it (1.0 point goes for this). It was very soothing to the throat with very nice flavour of curry leaves and mustard. Also, ordered veg shammi ke kebab, nothing gret to mention about it, infact there was no salt in the kebab.
We moved on the main course, ordered cottage cheese koftey, coriander chilli garlic naan and a masala kulcha. Koftey curry was blunt in taste with very less salt and spices. After discussion with Chef, the gravy of the curry was changed, which too was blunt, on asking the Chef about the same he said ""Generally, people don't have much salt here else they return the curries"". Nothing special to mention about the breads, they were just generic.
Overall, it was not a very good experience. We did not enjoy the food. I would suggest, as they market this restaurant Deori as their Indian cuisine restro, so they should stick to the flavours and not customize the authenticity. I do not recommend this place",2,"2015-05-29 14:08:06",118,641,0

Entered an empty hotel , no hustle bustle , wondered if we were the only guests at night . most of their dining areas empty.

Again empty ..
Ordered a paneer starter - don't remember the menu listing but it was a filo wrapped paneer with dry fruit stuffing in between 3 layers of paneer. 
The 4 pieces were decent but one dimensional . so chutney or any complementing dish with it...
For the main course , ordered lucchi mushroom Mel , no lucchi flavour , heavy dominating tomato flavor , probably old mushrooms ....very very pedestrian for 700‚Çπ
For rotis ordered the chilli garlic kulcha , roomali roti and sheermal ...
Kulcha had nothing close to chilli and garlic ..it was more like a onion kulcha
Roomali was good and sheermal was also decent

Satisfaction - zero

For such a stunning property. Its sad its being neglected ..

"1889238","Went for a lunch buffet here and North Indian Food Festival was the theme. Was pretty excited.
Started off with the Salads which were pretty decent and started waiting for the starters (supposedly to be served on table). And waited and waited. The service was terribly slow. I was wondering if they had the same day delivery. 
3 out of the 4 starters came and the last one took ages to come, before which half of us had already moved to the main course. None of them were HYATT standards.
On asking for Breads, the lady serving is just wondering as if we spoke in some random language.
Even the main course spread was 2 veg items and 2 non-veg items and they were all pretty bad. Mutton wasn‚Äôt well cooked, chicken was average. That's all in the Non-Veg. In veg we had the Dal Rajwadi, if the Rajwars eat this dal, they would kill themselves. Dal is kept on an induction cooker and is boiling, were they still making it? And the best, I have never seen a biryani being served in a Rice Cooker, it was really dry and tasteless . That too in a hotel of such high standards. 
Either they had a bad day or bad luck with us, don‚Äôt know, Even simple drinks like a Mojito or LIT were so bad we had to return them. The desserts were decent. 
All in all, the food ,the service, the drinks were terrible. To top it all off there were flies and mosquitos everywhere, there were flies even sitting on food as well, no one can sit in a place which is quite filthy like this. After numerous complaints to the helpless or ignorant ( not sure which one applied here ), he gave us a discount.
