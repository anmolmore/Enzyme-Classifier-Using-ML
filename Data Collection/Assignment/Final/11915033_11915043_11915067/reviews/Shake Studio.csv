The pink lady is definitely one of the finest shakes from them and also I believe best seller for them and the Belgium choco shake is also perfect.
The non-veg platter is a perfect combination with a shake. Overall the snack and the shakes are perfect.¬†
Must try the place. Don't miss it. Their plastic bottle shake is a welcome change.",5,"2019-04-22 22:43:19",1031,1653,0
"33902052","Ordered chicken popcorn (15 pieces). It was not good. It was not like regular popcorns with chicken pieces inside fried coatings. It was instead tasting like meatballs. Instead of chicken pieces, ground chicken with some flour was what I found inside. Not tasty at all.",2,"2019-04-21 12:52:16",20,10,0

Had Shake Studio's 'Classic Brownie' Shake this Diwali night. Blend in with brownie, dark chocolate and ice cream, it's one of the best Shakes I ever had. Tried many Shakes from many houses within and outside Hyderabad, I must recommend the 'Classic Brownie' Shake from 'Shake Studio'. Do order or give a visit to experience the taste.",5,"2018-11-10 16:45:52",8,8,0

Having tried shakes from different places, Shake Studio has been the best so far.
Their Kaapi Brownie is too die for with amazing flavors.
The thickness of the shake is apt.
The Classic Brownie is an evergreen shake and the brownies they use are of good quality and taste amazing.
The Rocky Rocher though needs a little improvement.",5,"2018-10-21 22:38:14",9,5,0
