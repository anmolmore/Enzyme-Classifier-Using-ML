"97312585","I ordered for home delivery. Very less quantity. Even for natural flavors the cost is way high for the quantity they send. Didn't find tender coconut ice cream as good as many folks said in their reviews. Ordered a cone too by paying 10 bucks but didn't receive any cone, and the restaurant number can't receive incoming calls so I can't even complain!!! A complete pathetic experience. Feel cheated. Will never order again.",1,"2019-05-10 19:09:37",1,0,0
"36531659","Ordered Chickoo & Litchi icecream. They came without the dry ice. When they reached me they were more like milkshakes than icecreams. I am surprised to see how well u have designed the cups to hold as minimum quantity as possible. I have attached a pic of it!! Not ordering again, I feel cheatedðŸ˜• Really disappointing.",1,"2019-04-19 23:23:16",44,65,1
"35360087","The place is located just beside TCS Synergy Park. The decor and ambiance is nice. They have cute chairs and show pieces and some really great quotes hung on the walls ðŸ’“
We got the opportunity to try Chickoo Ice Cream and Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream.
The Chickoo Ice Cream really had the flavor of chickoo. So if ypu are looking for a fruit flavour based ice cream, you can try those here !
The Brownie was also nice. But I felt its cost was a bit high based on the quantity.
If what you read is in any way helpful for you , do like the review and follow us ! We would be happy to bring in honest reviews about different restaurants all across India ! ðŸ˜ƒ",3,"2019-02-24 02:50:41",67,264,2
