"33899594","One of my favorite restaurants in the locality. Great food. Good interiors and good service. I love their set of menu. The quality, portion size and the taste of food never disappoints. Some of my favorites are stuffed chicken breast, curry cream risotto with chicken and broccoli and Hyderabad hot pizza. ",5,"2019-05-17 20:01:33",6,1,0

Food is amazing, they have baked pizzas that's really tasty and cool, their cooler drinks are tasty, snackers lip smacking.
We were 6 of us and this person there, Sachin, was really nice and on spot. Served us right, made sure our food experience was smooth, kept asking us feedback of the food. It's a lovely place. Must go.
Thank-you Frio! :)",5,"2019-05-17 11:36:37",54,68,9

Food- 4.5
Service- 3
Value for money- 4.5
Came here for a quick lunch.
Ordered mezze platter, wild mushroom fricassee and peach iced tea. 
Hummus tasted good but the pita bread was a little hard. 
The pasta was heavenly. Perfectly cooked pasta and lots of mushroom with an amazing sauce. 
Iced tea tasted nice but was a little too sweet. Make sure you mention it to them if you’re not a fan of super sweet drinks. 
Could improve on the service bit, the staff is a little slow and less responsive even when it isn’t crowded. 
5/5 in terms of value if you’re a gold member. 
Surely trying this place again.",4,"2019-05-09 12:50:13",72,410,1
"884061","Wonderful restaurant! Absolutely fabulous food!
Ambience: very nice and comfy... Doesn't feel rushed which is particularly important for this kind of place.
Food: every morsel is heavenly! They nailed both veg and non veg dishes which is a rarity in itself... Loved the pizzas, the fish and chips is a must order, the penne Alfredo is pretty good too... As is the spicy crispy chicken leg dish.... Absolutely delicious! Mushroom soup was very nice too.... minestrone was average.... Couldn't try the desserts because there's only so much a person can have lol...
P.S. - they do have a bar but no Bira.
Service - polite. But you must be patient. Food preparation takes time. If you reach post 9:30pm, you will be expected to order your entire meal in one shot itself.
VFM - it's an expensive bistro but the chef deserves it. He's absolutely spot on with the flavours. I would strongly recommend this restaurant. You deserve it!",5,"2019-05-05 13:39:18",141,3143,1

"30390569","Really really nice addition to the Gachibowli food scene, this place is comfortably furnished and rather perfect for a long catch up over delectable food.
Pineapple espresso, burgers and the pork ribs are highly recommended. Pizzas looked interesting as well.
Good value for money. Good service, although our server seemed slightly clueless initially.
Definitely worth a couple of visits :)",4,"2019-05-04 15:43:22",102,540,0

"46566007","This is one of the poor Italian restaurants in Hyderabad. The first giveaway was the menu cards. They were all torn and faded. Few of them even had the spiral binding missing in places.
The chairs and table cloth evinced that the restaurant was not very well maintained.
Coming to the food, I can say that it was very disappointing. We had ordered -
•Chicken Wings
•Tangy Arrabita Pasta
•Farmer's Ortalano
•Tiramisu
▪︎The chicken wings were marketed as a spicy dish but the spice was no where to be felt. Also, the wings were glazed in two different sauces though they both tasted the same - Sweet and heavy.
▪︎The red sauce of the pasta was diluted .It was done to such an extent that the sauce was not willing stay with the penne pasta.
▪︎The pizza was the first relief, though it wasn't as it as some of the other restaurants. It was thin and it retained its shape.
▪︎The tiramisu was a disaster. The cream was spoilt and the whole desert tasted sour. We had to send it back.
Finally, the service. The service was one of the very few worthwhile experience.
All in all, I will not visit this restaurant again and a do not recommend it to anyone.",2,"2019-04-30 19:25:09",1,1,0

"2372120","Food was great... We ordered Andhra chicken pizza which had a variant touch of Andhra flavours, Prawn n fish risotto and Fiery chicken meal. All the three dishes were tasty and filling. We availed zomato gold offer but as we did not inform them before placing the order, initially they were very reluctant to accept as we need to inform them well in advance before placing the order. The restaurant manager was very understanding and generated a second bill, though he will be questioned by the owner he took that extra mile just for providinding customer satisfaction. I will definitely suggest this restaurant not only in terms of food but also in terms of their polite and customer oriented generosity. Thank you frio for making our visit splendid.

"1537796","After hearing so much about pork ribs, ordered blazed pork ribs and belly dance Pizza on my visit .
The ambience was good , but disappointed with the service. There was long delay for serving the food, no proper attention to the customer requirements was the key disappointment factor.
Coming to main topic the food Pizza was great but it was a mixed feel for pork ribs as I always like my meat to be spicy but the barbequed sauce was little sweet not to my liking.
so with my limited knowledge of consistency of meat the overall all food served was good.
But it's not a place for people like me who is more into spiciness.
With Zomato gold the overall bill was 860.",4,"2019-04-02 10:35:33",2,16,5

Visited this place for dinner yesterday night. I would say first visit was very nice. Pretty empty when we reached but later the restaurant got occupied . We ordered Mezze platter and Frio Signature Chicken Wings for starters. Mezze platter was very flavourful and good in quantity. Chicken wings were also very delicious . The Barbecue one was my favourite. For the mains we ordered Barbecue Pork Ribs and Greek Chicken Souvlaki. Both the dishes were absolutely delicious. Really liked the flavour of the Chicken Souvlaki.

"430030","Very good quality food - I tasted the Baby Back Ribs here and they were delicious. One of my other friends had ordered pizza - though the presentation was above standard, the taste wasn't.
The ambience of the place can be improved because it's just slightly dull and cramped up at the moment, though they can do a lot with the place. Food-wise, a must visit.",4,"2019-03-29 23:18:33",4,1,0
"31732677","My pizza looks like they have pieced together the left overs! The cheese is hard and the slices look old. I'm so disappointed as I order quite frequently from Frio and this is the second time I am getting a pizza in this condition from them. ",1,"2019-03-27 13:34:08",1,29,0
"6087451","Frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet, interesting evening conversation.
The music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud. It moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space.
Service was fine. We had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us, but were courteous and friendly.
Here is what we ordered:
100% arabica cold coffee - basic and just right. Creamy and not too sugary.
Dark chocolate shake - absolute yum and sinful. It tastes exactly as you would want it to. The only ask - since it's categorized as thickshake, it should be thicker, but I guess that's the case with shakes served anywhere in the city.
Chicken ala plancha - Sheer dissapointment, especially given that it was in chef's special menu. It was as ordinary as ordinary can be. We ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs. It's basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning. Wouldn't recommend.
Lamb ravioli - It's a shame we don't get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta. Even if they do, it's mostly vegetarian (spinach and ricotta cheese without exception). To our delight, Frio doesn't disappoint here. The ravioli is good (doesn't make it to my top 5 list), but still good. Ravioli was cooked well, herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy.
We couldn't get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order (20 mins before closing), but I have heard that their tiramisu is great.
All in all, Frio is a good place to visit. In terms of food, you could love or let's say not love the place basis what dish you ordered. I won't be a frequent here, but wouldn't mind going back for another try either. Happy dining!",3,"2019-03-23 23:58:34",15,20,2

"1984978","I'm reviewing a delivery order.
I've ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place.
It was soaking in oil and very less quantity.
The packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care. No spoon/fork and tissues were given with the pack.
I really liked the way they didn't backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes. Keeping the oil aside, the taste was good. However, there is scope for improvement because I've read good things about this place and their food. Didn't expect it to be like this.",3,"2019-03-13 18:57:57",67,435,0
"740280","Frio is one of my favourite places to go to in Gachibowli since it opened, and by now, I’ve pretty much tried most of their dishes. Their staff is cordial and efficient, the black toned decor is very avant-garde, the quality of their food hasn’t deteriorated in the last 2 years. 
The must try dishes on the menu are –
1. Glazed pork ribs (sinful and heavenly!)
2. Chermoula grilled fish
3. House chicken salad 
4. Turkish lamb pizza
5. Mushrooms fricasse pasta ",5,"2019-03-12 05:08:25",32,347,1

"1560178","I was at this bistro for dinner with my friends recently on a weekday.
Ambience was decent. It was a tad too dark for my liking, but the spacious table setting and the gentle hit tracks playing in the background made up for a nice dinner setting.
Service was pretty decent. The waiter who attended our table was courteous and prompt in serving.
The food was a big disappointment though. Of all the dishes we ordered, few starters and the tiramisu cake were the only saving grace. Main course (Spinach ravioli, Belly dance pizza, Stuffed chicken breast and Greek chicken sovlakhi) was a total disaster. Not a single person from our group of 6 could find anything tasty from this bunch. We finished the meal off with tiramisu and dbc cake, which was good and filling. 
Overall, an average restaurant. If you’re looking for good Italian, this is not the place to be. CIBO house is. ",3,"2019-03-02 00:08:34",9,59,2

"2593948","This place is my go to place for continental food at Gachibowli. The food is absolutely awesome. My recommendations would be Doner kebab, any variant of their thin crust pizza and pork ribs.
The doner kebabs are filled with juicy lamb meat balls and topped with spicy mayo stuffed inside fluffly pita breads with a sude of humus.
In pizza, I love the pigs over a blanket pizza. The pizza crust is super thin and this place serves one of the best wood fire pizzas here.
In mains, the pork ribs just melts in your mouth and the stuffed chicken breast is deliciously with the filling of creamy spinach inside.
In desserts I loved all their creations from the baklava, to cherry chocolate cheese cake and to the old fashioned tiramisu...
The service is quick and the staff is courteous. ",5,"2019-02-16 10:15:51",55,122,9

Have been to this place couple of times and Everytime tried something new in veg. But pizza has been a constant one. The Spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds. These two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well.
A friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place.
Review#2 my regular visits to this place made me increase the rating from 4 to 5.
I have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it's the best pizza in town or money back .
Tough I did claim the money back as I feel the best pizza in town is what you get here.

"723229","Been to this place last month. Quite a peaceful place not many people were there. We ordered some drinks and pizza and pasta. I somehow felt pizza could have been little better the taste was good and it was cooked properly. But there were literally no toppings except chicken. Pasta was clearly not upto the mark. I had given specific instructions which weren't taken care at all. Also, later during the billing there were some confusions on the gold membership. We did inform the staff at tge beginning that we have Zomato gold however not sure if that was well communicated to the management, because during the billing we were said that we should have informed about the gold membership earlier which we clearly did. But didn't quite understood whats the problem if it is not communicated at the beginning..

Decided to check it out and was badly disappointed.
The mild mushroom soup was too bland and they don't serve a 1/2 of the soup. You will have to order 2 soups instead.
The Red Rooster pizza just didn't have any taste to it.
Gachibowli fried chicken was a disaster.
Stuffed grilled chicken breast was the only face saver at this place.
The regular water they served had dust floating on it, had to get bottled water.
Would never go to this place again. Won't recommend to anyone either.

"16051718","We went to Frio Bistro on a lazy Sunday evening. It’s easy to find and a cozy place right on the main road. The portions are all made for one person only but are very filling. We had the Alfredo pasta and it was hands down one of the best pastas I’ve had in the city. The starters are good and filling. The mocktails are fun tasty drinks.

"34000933","The place had an amazing smell of bathroom pee when we entered. Hillariously the manager seemed barely aware of this horrible stench and promised to spray.
The lamb pizza which I suspect used the same sauce as the kheema was good but too salty likely cus it's meant to be eaten with spaghetti. The mezze platter is enough for one person barely. It's literally a single plate filled with 3 dips and 6 breads the size of a palm without fingers.
The desserts is where this place shines. They apparently think tiramisu is a soggy cake..? That fondant cake should taste still of maida because they didn't understand the concept and that managers should barely give a shit OR apologize.
Don't go its bad.",2,"2018-12-22 09:40:53",4,80,0

Food was ok. First was minestrone soup, it did not have any exotic vegetables or pasta. Tangy taste was good. Mezze platter was average.humus was good while pita bread was not upto the mark. Thin crust pizza Farmers Orelanto was good. Had nice crust. among deserts, ordered for chocolate fondant, it was the best with right amount of sweetness.

"35062769","The place has a nice quiet ambience, I was surprised that it wasn't crowded as you'd expect a top place to be on a weekend.
We were ushered in well and we choose a nice cozy place, the place had a nice charm to it . We ordered the Tangy Grilled Mushrooms and the Glazed Pork Ribs, but the disappointing aspect of our visit though was we were rushed into placing the order. We came in at 10pm and we were told to place our last orders instantly, when I checked they said the place shuts down at 11pm and the last order was at 10:15pm.
Coming to food, the mushrooms seemed a bit too tangy but that's probably my palate , the glazed pork ribs were top notch and juicy and tender. Had it not been for the pushy waiters we would have liked to order drinks and a dessert too.
The waiters made sure that they cleared the plates in a jiffy and pounced on us with our last spoon handing us the copy of the bill and all of this before we even touched 11pm. Not that our intentions were to have a night out there but you don't actually liked to be rushed on your orders and food, it just doesn't leave a good experience, Possibly the restaurant and it's employees were planning on catching a flight and made sure nothing came in the way.

I am have visited this restaurant before & it was an awesome experience , we used Zomato good during this visit of ours , not sure if this has anything to do with the food taste , there were 2 pizza slices left & the the restaurant said they will not pack the leftover food as they said it was orders / rules from zomato , they said they would rather throw the left over in the dustbin but  not give it to the customer , this is very strange rules , zomato relook at your guidelines ",2,"2018-10-27 14:39:56",5,1,0
"41928997","Frio bistro is a fine-dining restaurant with classy interiors which was painted full of black color which brings the elagance to the place. The bar set-up was small,quirky & the inverted glasses tied up with the ceiling made it look beautiful. This place offers italian,Indian & Continental as well.
.
I visited this place yesterday for a quick lunch & ordered two main course dishes. The first dish was belly dance pizza which is a 12"" thin crust pizza topped with Arabian shawarma peices,capsicum which had that earthy flavor in it . The chicken pieces were juicy & tender. The whole pizza tasted delicious with it's toppings. The other dish we ordered was spinach & cream cheese ravioli. Pasta was hand -made by the chef added with Italian styled tomato salsa & fresh parmesan cheese . Ravioli was stuffed with spinach which wasn't up to the mark. After having pasta, I felt like I should have ordered the white -sauce variant.

"54408202","So, we decided to have some grub on a Monday afternoon and dashed off to Frio Bistro for no particular reason. There were not many customers around and that definitely helped us get some attention but the service was OK. We carefully curated our order - Chimichuri Pan Fried Fish, Lamb Ravioli and Andhra Pepper Chicken Pizza. I must say the food tasted authentic and delicious.
Chimichuri Pan Fried Fish, the chef's special, came with fish boasting a tangy and spicy herb crust, salsa, sauteed spinach and scallion rice. It was easily the best dish we ordered. The Lamb Ravioli was creamy but we were searching for the minced meat therein. Then came the spicy Andhra Pepper Chicken Pizza. It generated some interest despite diminishing appetite by then.
All in all, the place did come across as expensive for the items and portion sizes but worth a visit.

"1454847","Have been for lunch. Honestly speaking had a good expectations, but not really did the food satisfy my taste buds.
Soup ""Rustic Itallian Minestrone"" was a good start to begin with. Assuming something different it will be ordered ""Gacchibowli Fried Chicken"", only to realise it was another version of KFC Friend Chicken. This was little disappointing. And in main course ""Stuffed Chicken Breast"" was descent and not so out of the world taste but it's ok.
All in all descent ambience, ok food but service has to be improved a lot. For me for sure not a second time visit place, rest you can do try for sure you may be lucky and fortunate to get better taste of food.",3,"2018-10-02 23:53:14",78,76,2

"34766446","Frio Bistro is a little quaint place tucked away somewhere in the crowded area of Gachibowli.
The decor was very pretty and the place looked very cosy.
We had non-veg pizza and chicken wings for starters. Both were equally good. The highlight of our meal was pork ribs which was served with veggies and mashed potato. The pork was soft and succulent and melted instantly in our mouth. One could easily say that was prime moment of our dine at Frio Bistro.
Desserts were good as well, but could have been better.
Overall, it’s a nice place to visit if you want to have a comfortable meal in the midst of the hustle bustle of this city.

It's a great place to hang out. We had the bacon pizza, Alfredo pasta, and the prawn and fish paella. On a visit before that we had the mushroom risotto. The mushroom risotto was great! The bacon pizza can have a bit more of the pizza sauce on it. I didn't like the taste of the raw red pepper in the paella. Finished with hot chocolate which was amazing.

We tried the Pizza, Chicken Breast stuffed with spinach, spaghetti followed by deserts.
The Turkish Pizza was the stand out dish for us (we did not expect that). The others were also very good and I would go again for sure.
The Tiramisu, although looked and smelled great was the biggest let down. The Bakhlava was just okay, not a bad attempt. The Cheese cake on the other hand was yumm...
Overall, I would recommend this place with a word of caution that it is on the expensive side. We ended up paying about a 1200 per head ... ",3,"2018-09-10 14:35:34",31,39,7

We went with the suggestion of the Steward, for starters had Mushroom on khari, turned out to be a good choice.
Son wanted to have lamb doner kebab in pita pocket. He was okay.
Spicy tomato arabitta turned out to be a tasteless flavour less offering. When we informed the Steward he got a fresh one made personally supervising. Turned out to be too saucy, no traces of parmesan cheese, probably it could have had few more pieces of the penne.
Finally the meal was concluded with a tiramisu. A bigger disappointment.",3,"2018-09-10 11:40:20",43,24,0
