"27402223","Being an enthusiast of rolls, till date this place tops the list of roll outlets in Hyderabad. This place beats everyone else in terms of portion, taste and price. My favourite is the single egg chilli chicken roll, just one bite and all the checkboxes are ticked - perfectly fried and slightly flaky paratha, evenly distributed egg on the inner side of it, the sumptous chunks of chicken and a perfect balance of the sauce and spices makes it the ideal place for roll-lovers.",5,"2018-12-20 00:30:28",4,28,0

"390963","Horrible chicken kassa...0 marks for it
Ordered lacha paratha with chicken kassa today from roll darbar, gachibowli via Ubereats and this is what I got. The parathas were good with less oil, the cucumber pieces and onions were fresh.
The chicken kassa was horrible. It was not at all chicken kassa.. Rather some dry preparation made out of some leftover tangy chicken masala/korma with tandoor/fried chicken pieces. This spoiled the whole taste ....150/- +10/- delivery charges by Ubereats...The thing that made me upset was though the place is owned by Odisha/Bengali people, still I got such a preparation for chicken kassa, not expected :(.

"37372238","Ultimate roll .. One of the best .. Price is also reasonable .. The drawback is that there is no seating place.. Small shops are nearby ..a bit clumsy.. But if u have no problem with all these ..I assure u that u are going to have ultimate rolls.. Just choose carefully rolls.as some of the special rolls are not that good ... Go for the regular rolls..",4,"2017-12-04 23:49:43",18,78,0
"4056571","Ordered fish keema cutlet today via swiggy.
It's crunchy but doesn't have that authentic essence that a cutlet should have. Simply deep fried and a tad bit salty. Maybe decreasing the thickness and increasing the fish quantity of the cutlets would create some magic.
Packaging was good though and kudos for the super fast delivery.
Edit : Had to add a second review because this place offers the best rolls in town. 
If you are a Bengali staying away from home and craving from some authentic Kolkata-type roll then this place is a heaven for you.thegreedygluttonsgastronomicjourney.wordpress.com",3.5,"2017-10-30 21:32:05",112,1242,5
"32212778","If you are dam hungry wanna grab a roll. This is the best place I suggest u guys. On Gachibowli main road
Food - Good tasty rolls they don't use much spicy
Quality- Freshly cooked rolls with tasty stuffings
Quantity - I just tried to eat 1 roll my tummy was full
Price - Less & Reasonable 
Well maintained kitchen, seperate tawa for veg and non-vegetarian foodies.
I have customised my veg paneer roll with less oil and less spicy. 
Overall my rating to Roll Darbar is 5stars cos here u can get actual rolls not like the sleek rolls u get in multiplex malls. ",5,"2017-08-08 01:38:00",14,75,2
"1293088","One of the best places that truly specialises in making rolls. The chilli paneer roll and the mix veg roll are my favourite. The blend of spices n sauces are exquisite and its priced very modestly. Do not miss ! ",4,"2017-08-06 12:59:50",138,401,0
"11670531","Most authentic Kolkata Kati roll in Hitech City Area. I have tried their Double Chicken Cheese Mutton Roll and Mutton Roll on two different occasions. The mutton literally melted in the mouth. The prices are also quite reasonable from Hyderabad standpoint. I would only urge them to keep the quality and standard consistent.",5,"2017-07-29 10:32:43",3,0,0
"4743521","Being a kiosk on a busy road, this place does serve up decents Kolkata rolls, having the price on a higher side. I, having had better rolls of the same nature at better prices at madhapur and kondapur, was septical of the place and it did not dissapoint me as there were better outlets that served the same what they provided at better price. 
One thing that stood out was that they had a huge variety and maybe the other stuff are good than the chiken roll. 
Will be visiting here for other stuff soon.

"27256000","Roll is one of the staple evening snack of any Bengali. But, in this era of cosmopolitanism, it has slowly become a favourite snack for many.
The kiosk is easily locatable on Gachbowli main road, just beside more supermarket. Also, there is ample parking room.
Coming to the food, I tried the darbar special veg roll, single egg spicy chicken roll and single egg chicken roll. The rolls were just Ok (or may be below OK). The filling contained more of onions than chicken, the kadhai was getting burnt everytime the filling was warmed and the place looks really unhygienic.
To add to all this, the person at the counter is a very short-tempered guy. The service is slow, most probably because the guy who cooks almost single-handedly manages everything (cooking, packing and sometimes billing).
Summary:-
Food: 3/5
Service: 2/5 (slow and inhospitable)
Price: 3.5/5
Hygiene:2/5
I think Roll Call Banjara Hills offers far better rolls for the same price. For Roll Darbar, it's a NO from my side for now.",2.5,"2017-06-08 22:22:47",93,71,0

We ordered double chicken double egg roll, tawa cheese roll, egg spicy chicken roll and egg cheese roll. All of them were tasty and we liked it really but it cannot be compared to kolkata kathi rolls in lots of stuffing and laccha paratha. However being in hyderabad having kolkata type rolls is a lot.

"4625021","Been wanting to go there to taste authentic Kolkata rolls n cud make it today after a long wait. 
Small roadside place on the main road serving some great rolls. Well served by a combination of Bengali n Oriya team. Parking can be an issue there at peak traffic times. 
Tried their tawa fried chicken rolls, egg chicken rolls n egg mutton rolls. The taste is really Kolkata type n they use lachha paratha and sauté the chicken well which makes the package better. Mutton egg roll was ok type but the chicken tawa as well as chicken egg rolls were really awesome. It was very mildly spiced n the flavour of chicken as well as paratha was very good. The best Kolkata kind of rolls we hv had in Hyderabad. 
Good value for money and excellent for a quick snack. Hope they maintain their quality well. Can hv some more stools for sitting as if can get crowded. ",4,"2017-03-22 23:26:37",106,186,0

The roti thickness was apt... egg on it was cooked well to perfection. The sauces and accompaniments added were of perfect ration. Meet was tender and of perfect spice level to go with the roll.

"464081","Hi 
I visited this place on a rainy late evening with my wife for a quick dinner. We went for double egg chicken roll and single egg cheese roll. The quality and quantity was perfect according to the price they charge. Had good conversation with the person near the counter too. 
If you are missing the Calcutta roll then have a roll from Roll Darbar and you will be lovin' it. 
When we reached there, they ran out of cutlets and chicken kassa. So these are the dishes I am looking forward to try next time.
Also, I had a word regarding home delivery and request them to tie up with Swiggy or similar to have it delivered! 
All in all, I loved this place and it's a complete VFM.

"34146777","Stopped by at this place for my love towards Rolls. What surprised me most was that their rolls were very close or almost similar to the ones we get in Calcutta. I had a couple of Double Chicken Tawa Fry Roll. It tasted just awesome and I preferred to get it made without the sauces so that it doesn't become soggy.

The stuffing is good with rich flavours and spices..the spice levels are optimum and the wrap is crisp.
We tried egg pepper chicken roll and chicken liver roll..
Both of them were nice..
Along with the rolls they also serve a chicken dish , which has thick gravy and chicken chunks served with parathas..
I am missing out on the name but it tasted really nice .. The spice levels were a bit more than that in the rolls but I really liked it.

"3053087","Roll Darbar @ Gachibowli!
Having heard from many foodies about the tasty Rolls of Kolkata being served at Roll Darbar near Gachibowli, I visited during this week. 
I asked for a Mushroom roll with less oil and it was made accordingly. I didnt find any trace of oil. Glad that my request was honored.  The quality of flour seemed good; outer layers of the roll was crisp and the inner layers were soft. However, they seem to have added extra vinegar and one of the sauce has made it too tangy. I did not feel like finishing off the entire roll. 
When I turned around to ask him why it tastes so tangy.. I was shocked to see the way it is being prepared.  One of the cooks fries the dough on the tawa. there after lifts it and throws on to the platform next to him. The roti lands on the plain platform which is a polished granite and it is not clean at all. The staff doesn't bother to put the roti on a plate and add the ingredients before adding the ingredients. This is bizzare. 
The roti is rolled properly and served. But the way it is prepared without using gloves is atrocious. While the rolls are priced at Rs70 - Rs 90, they should prepare it with proper hygiene.  Irrespective of the prices... hygiene and neatness is the basic thing which is lacking at this place.mysticalfoodie.com",2,"2015-10-09 19:18:55",211,1366,4

"1040272","I was desperately looking out for a Franky outlet as my friend asked wants to try something new other than regular pizza or burger or Chinese. I knew I could find something interesting in Gachibowli and just drive here and found this place. 
Initially I was thinking if I should go in or look for another one since there is no crowd and felt I would be the first customer and not sure if that taste good or so. After watching this sign board for a minute it feels something interesting to me and finally get there for take away.
As this is the first time I do not want to try new or chefs special hence ordered regular 'Chicken Roll - Double Egg'. I am really surprised that chef preparing it so interestingly that took my attention. I felt happy at the same time think it will definitely be TASTY and IT WAS.

Ordered a normal Eggless Chicken Roll and Single Egg Chicken Roll for me and my husband who was definitely feeling hungry after the usual day in office. Pretty decently priced @50, @60 and @70. U dont get a Single Egg Roll there. It starts from only a Double Egg roll. We liked the flavour. They did not experiment with their own innovation, right amount of simple ketchups, chillis, lime and onions and the right size to fill us for dinner. Satisfied! Worth trying and going back.

"637429","I have been twice to this place. Its conveniently located near MORE supermarket adjacent to Raidurgam Police HQ (same Bldg as Over The Flames pizzeria and Rice Bowl). Its run by an Odiya dude with Bengali cooks. So I expected very little to go wrong, taste wise. 
We ordered double-egg-chicken roll. When I saw it, it was as thick as a baseball bat and was stuffed with chicken-masala and onions. This behemoth needs an extra-huge appetite and is a meal by itself! For 80 bucks, its total VFM for me. Tastewise, the paratha was perfectly done with crinkly and crunchy edges. The egg coating was thick (which proved it was double-egg) and the chicken was perfectly spiced for my palate! It was as if the chef knew Exactly how much spice would fit my taste buds! Being from Orissa and being a sucker for the quintessential street food called ""Roll"", this place takes me back to my teenages and has that typical ""OPOLFED"" flavor, for those who know it! 
There's no place to sit...as it Should be like a Odiya ""roll/chowmein shop"". Inside the shop, there's a very neat and clean setup and the smell of the chicken-masala-stuffing being fried, just flies your heart back to home!
For taste, VFM and Memories, I would easily rate it a 4/5!",4,"2015-07-17 22:00:19",20,118,0

Location: Very Near to Gachibowli fly over, opposite to Al-Shaba restaurant. Located in same complex of More Supermarket.
This is a kiosk setup, one can ideally see the kitchen and the way they prepare the rolls. They prepared in clean and hygienic way. Tried quite a few different types of rolls, I tried almost all types of rolls. The chicken filling is fantastic, the little of dash of lemon in chicken filling makes the roll even more enjoyable. One double egg double chicken roll is sufficient for dinner. Price also economical. People visit this place often cause of its quality and taste.
Totally, this place is ideal for quick and most rolls ranging from 60-80/- makes it a very value for money place. Thumbs up for this place!!",4.5,"2015-07-16 16:20:51",1,43,0

"2037016","Call it a roll or a frankie it seems the same to me. Rather new place that popped up at the fag end of gachibowli. Now this places seem a more complete with delhi 39, ricebowl,just bake, over the flame , hunan spice ......
A pretty normal place as the name suggests currently offering limited spread of rolls. I had tried the darbar special with egg roll. Pretty decent affair, nothing special or exotic about it, at the same time wouldnt mind having it near by.

"786673","Finally, a roll center in gachibowli! Went to this place while returning from a picnic, which is located in the same complex as that of Rice Bowl, Over the flames and Delhi 39.
Tried the egg chicken roll ; the double egg chicken roll priced at ₹60 had generous stuffing of chicken masala and the maida bread was apt in thickness and crunchy on its outer layer.Absolutely, relished it.Those who have a larger appetite can go for the double egg chicken roll.
Also tried the chicken cutlets.They need to enrich the masala stuffing , it was not giving a distinguished flavour of the chicken.
Overall, it was a cherishing  experience as after a long time, tried the authentic rolls, and it was a welcome relief from the frankies.",3.5,"2015-06-28 22:08:29",117,829,3
