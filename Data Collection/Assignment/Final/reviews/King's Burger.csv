"40984746","Very tasty burgers. The hot chicken burger is my favorite. Crispy chicken burger is also good. And that's coming from someone who doesn't usually prefer burgers. ðŸ˜‰",4,"2019-05-03 14:30:15",12,2,0
"506651","Mediocre food that is overpriced. I could open my fridge right now and make a burger that tastes better than the food at this place. I literally have no idea why anybody would eat here. Even the name isn't original.",1,"2019-04-25 17:36:58",43,96,0
"740106","Ordered from Zomato. Utter disappointment both were. See the picture to know why.
The patty was good, but oh the size. Eating half the bread by itself is a big no no.
Would I order again? Noooooooo",2,"2019-01-13 00:08:20",50,99,1

"5657151","You call THIS a burger? A slice of tomato, bits of lettuce & patty half the size of bun? You're in a way cheating your customers with stuff like this. Ridiculous. I'm gonna make sure none of the people i know ever visit your place again. And to have the nerve to say this is a standard preparation. Its an abomination!",1,"2018-08-30 22:46:02",16,3,1

"390963","Ordered King's chicken burger via Ubereats. The delivery was on time and the packing was alright. The burger was OK too. However, I found it way too expensive for 105/- for that portion size. Actual menu said 85/- and Ubereats delivered it at 105..No bill was attached.",3,"2018-03-31 00:35:27",114,530,1

"29084743","I tried their butter scotch shake and Crispy chicken burger.
The burger was fresh and delicious.
Though I didnâ€™t like shake much. If couldâ€™ve been better.

"5429771","It's a cute small outlet. We ordered a number of things like burger, pizza, vada pao, chicken roll.
Burger could have been better if it was warmer. The pizza was nice (not restaurant quality but better than the one you expect at such outlets.
The vada pao was good and the chicken roll was great with all the juicy pieces of chicken and their tasty sauce. ",3,"2017-08-09 19:56:55",42,37,1
"4743521","DLF has many jewels among itself in terms of small food outlets and this one can truly be regarded as one. One thing is for sure that this outlet can give many popular outlets a run for their money provided they make it big. 
Though being a small outlet, their burgers are really good and its a must try. 
We ordered the crispy chicken burger, to compare it with the one from Burger king, and its actually better with the lettuce providing the much needed base to the burger which lacks in the one from Burger King.
It's a little dearer that the popular food outlets but its criminal to miss this outlet. Head out here and enjoy some truly delicious burgers.

"29826029","Ordered Chicken burger and one veg burger for snacks and really found the burger as one of the best burger i ever had.Â 
The best thing is the patty inside , it is always so crisp and juicy that even right now I am craving for it. :P Buns are always so fresh. I surely recommend you to try the burger from this place even if you're dieting give your taste buds a real treat.facebook.com",4.5,"2017-04-17 16:59:46",157,364,1

Bringing down rating from 4.5 to 3. The quality of burger has come down drastically in last couple of orders. The bun is not fresh. The wrap was still good though.

Have tried the veg wraps and burgers here. Got to give it to them for the awesome food. The wraps are heavenly. The burger patties and bun are out of the world. I only wish they topped it with some caramelised onions. The prices are also reasonable.
Only downside is the that the starters are bit oily. So it might not be a good idea to try those.",3,"2017-04-12 02:49:59",119,597,2
"78844","THE BEST BURGER I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE!!! I have had the King's Special Non-veg Burger for three nights in a row and hell, I see this becoming an addiction!
The bun is always fresh, the chicken patty crisp, soft and cooked to the right extent, the condiments minimal so that nothing overpowers the taste of the patty and most importantly, the portions of onion, tomato and cabbage included are only enough to enhance the taste of the patty!
Anybody in the DLF area in Hyderabad needs to try this.",5,"2017-03-01 23:02:07",50,434,0
"11880381","Ordered a tandoori chicken burger and a chicken mixed spicy rolls to cater to some midnight hunger pangs..
The burger had nothing tandoori about it and was spilling mayo all over (was looking for mint chutney) but this tasted more like McChicken and Chicken whopper had a malbutruoned baby.
The rolls were just like cigar sized chicken nuggets, nothing like the photos, and full of unnecessary veggies, bad after taste.
Delivery was on time but the guy made me walk a Km to find him, because he couldn't find me. 
Over all give it a skip from our end ! ",1.5,"2017-01-25 02:03:38",116,932,0
