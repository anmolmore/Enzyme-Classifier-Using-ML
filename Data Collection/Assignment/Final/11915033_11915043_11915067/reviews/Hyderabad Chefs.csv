"60562007","Ordered chicken dum Biryani from this place once but taste is not upto the mark.
Later on tried chicken fry biryani from this place nearly 3 to 4 times. Everytime I ordered the taste is awesome. Even we can try tandoori chicken from this place it also tastes good.",4,"2019-04-12 21:58:11",15,2,0

"3029315","The staff is not at all polite. Even we got dirty plates. Its one of the worst experience I had. I would suggest to order food from online if you wish to have food from here. The taste of food is decent but it has no ambience. In a way they charge more than the service they provide. ",2,"2018-12-10 13:50:05",38,172,0

"1208622","A decent place with a regular setup but the pricing is very high. Veg Biryani itself costing at 210/-. It is more like a casual hotel, can't call it a restaurant as it have no ambience, not good tables and chairs. We had Butter Naan and Butter Chicken and the taste was good and service is also good. But the look of the restaurant should be improved.",3,"2018-08-23 20:28:28",24,557,0

"4121431","Perfect place at a perfect time! All said once when it was inaugurated as everyone near DLF Hyd had to travel to other places for a good team lunch/dinner.
But gradually restaurant failed to impress the employees and they are traveling again! :D 
Nevertheless, Food is better especially the biryani.
Ambience is okay, and service could do a little bit better. They take a whole lot of time to get your ordered food on to the table.
One time visit.
