"42223911","The managers are so rude to the customers. Twice they declined the entry on two consecutive days. We came here looking at the reviews but the behavior of the staff killed the mood. They seemed bias towards the guests and prefer people whom they know at the entry.",1,"2019-05-18 20:56:41",3,10,0
"33045786","One of the best places to chill and drink in Hyderabad. The Japanese fried chicken, the kung pao chicken and the beautiful ice cold brewed beer ( we loved the Weizen Bock beer) are the best. Ask for Kamal who is simply the sweetest and the best server at the place. He recommended the best dishes and the best beer. Make sure to ask for Kamal when visiting OTM. Cheers!!!

They have a quite a different variety of food available from snacks to main course, from desi to continental, from Street snacks to authentic cuisine. Live music is good as well.

Could be salsa or any other form considering they have so many...definitely they were not the guests, looking at their proficiency... Very good food... Not so great beer from their in house brews... You will be shocked to see some healthy variants... Worthy try though... Overall a must go place for the experience. ",4,"2019-05-15 17:29:21",3,9,2

Not worth for money. 1star from my side",1,"2019-05-14 22:12:25",3,27,0
"39611297","If trying brewed beer is what you love to do ... This place is a must visit . It's has a very rustic and welcoming ambience. One of their best beer would be the OTM Lager. For starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when I say it's one of the best vegetarian starters I had in a while . The lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. The sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. I would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. Also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. The chicken Tikka was one of the best tikkas I had. The meat was tender and perfectly Cooked.The mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.
If you want to drop in to grab a quick bite and some drinks after a hectic day at work ... This would be the perfect place.",4,"2019-05-14 15:36:31",22,92,5

"1667346","This place was on my Hyderabad bucket list for a long time. The ambience was awesome to top that it was IPL 2019 final. The live dj was great. Coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of Belgian brewed üç∫ (warning it's a jug rather than a pitcher) but that's the best beer I ever had. The beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza. Both of them were outstanding.
The worst part was the service the place is short on staff. One waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table. ",3,"2019-05-13 01:35:13",4,6,4

Ambience: Its beautiful and so lovely and happening .
Food : We ordered irani chicken tikka and a mexican pizza .The chicken tikka was a lil undercooked and also it was bland . 
Dint like at all . The pizza was good and loaded with cheese and veggies.

Food was good too.
Only reason am giving a 4 and not 5 is the air conditioner for some God damn reason was not effective enough. Be ready to sweat! We had to remind waiter who was attending us constantly to keep it cool.

Coming to the menu they have good amount of beer options to choose from. We ordered Apple cider beer and it was amazing. And from the food options we ordered three cheese mushroom and California chicken pizza. Both the items were good. It was great experience.

A cold beer and OTM make for the best of times.Ditch the usual choices and try out their in-house specialities, you will not regret it. Bringing the microbrewery culture to Hyderabad, this place is a must for anybody looking to chill, beer and eat all the same time, plus they have games!! So, head over there and let your hair down a little. I would recommend this place over and over!

"42157679","Been here for the first time. The food and the beer was great. Had ordered the white high pitcher, mutton kheema kothu parotta, basil chicken tikka and three cheese mushroom. The beer had a hint of citrus and a subtle sweet taste. The kothu parotta was a melt in the mouth delicious and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The mushroom was crisp and served as the crunchy element. Our table incharge Keshav ensured that our orders were on time and we had a pleasant experience. Kudos to him.

"7994471","Decent place. We went there on a Saturday night and while we were disappointed with most restaurants not allowing a kid, this one didn't let us down. We ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. We couldn't eat anything more! Also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. Decent enough. Also wanted to try the moonlit one. But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!

But a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best. A little costly. Caution: if you are a stag majority of times they won't allow u on ground floor in evenings, which is kind of sucks though.

Book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends. Hospitality of the place is also very good. They serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.
Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.
Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar.  Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn‚Äôt chur chur, it was plain naan.  Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.

"41914577","Went here to catch up with a friend, very near the ORR entrance and right beside the main road. The interior was well done with the brewing machine at display which was the centre of attraction for most people visiting there. The seating was plush and comfortable. The choice of food was aplenty and the service was very prompt and homely. The preparation and plating everything was about perfect, but we did not liked the Lemon soda, it had some weird taste. In all it was good.",3,"2019-04-25 17:46:14",5,3,0
"15390331","Over the Moon is a brewery where you get a lot of beer to try from. We tried the apple cider(3/5), stout (4/5) and two others ( think one was called moonlit) (5/5) which were pretty good. The food was superb as well. We had the Burmese Parcel (5/5), Nachos (5/5), French Fries(2/5), Prawns (5/5), Chicken Kebabs(5/5), Chicken Poppers (5/5) and Mutton Kebabs(5/5).
