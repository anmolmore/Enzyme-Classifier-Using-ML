"15774506","1 star only for okay-ish cheese chicken paratha.
As the rating is 4.6, we came to this place with high hopes.
The food is 'feeka'. I ordered aalu cheese paratha, chicken cheese paratha, chhole bhature and corn tikki.
Bhature had a weird taste of burnt oil. Chhole were tasteless. And the corn tikki was the worst. Also it was raw. Not cooked properly.
If you're craving for some tasty north indian food, don't come to this place. ",1,"2019-05-13 22:19:53",2,28,0
"1529346","Came in with great expectations and boy did this place miss the mark ! Ambience is alright, summers are brutal here so my 2 cents would be to bring in additional coolers or fans. Anyways coming to the main part which was the food :¬†Tandoori Chicken : Good mighty lord, the chicken was hard, chewy and dry on the inside. Clear signs that it wasn't freshly prepared.¬†
Cheese Garlic Naan : Not sure but the naans had a coat of yellow on it. Eitherways, they just apply cheese on top and not on the inside which is the usual case. It looked terrible from the minute it hit the table and it got so dry after a few minutes that it was just a turn off.¬†
I did enjoy the lassi a lot, the paneer item was alright but overall given the rating and the expectations that brought with it I was quite disappointed.",2,"2019-05-12 18:25:53",37,304,0

What should i say about this placeüòç. One of the best places in hyderabad for north indian lovers. Dal makhani, chur chur naan and kulchas. Simply loved them. The mango lassi added cherry on the cake. Mind blowing food, highly recommended and a must try for every north indian food lover.

"1161222","In my 27 years in hyderabad, i have never liked a single north indian restaurant till i entered the punjabis swag. Being born a north indian and after spending some time up north ive had such amazing food there that i have always had this complaint that we in hyderabad dont make good north indian food. For years now i had been avoiding north indian restaurants to avoid disappointment when one fine day i decided to check this place out. It turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life.
The ambience is pretty cool, a very lively place. We went there late so it was easy to get a table. We ordered amritsari fish, malai tandoori, chur chur naan, chawal wala chicken, kheema pav and a patiala lassi. Let me first talk about the dishes i enjoyed. Chur chur naan was out of this world, i was not expecting it to be soo good. They had a typical aloo ke parantha ka stuffing in a naan which they crumble top it with butter and nuts and serve it hot with chole chutney and raita. I am in love with this dish. Kheema pav was the best i have had in any restauarnt in india. Kheema pav is my litmus test and trust me most restaurants have failed in it. These guys just killed it. 
Coming to the other dishes, the fish amritsari was pretty average maybe because i was expecting alot coz i had tasted the other things first. The malai tandoori was good and the chawal wala chicken was pretty mediocre. Coming to the patiala lassi, i am not a big fan of lassi and there have been very few places in the country where i have loved lassi. This place would be on the top 3 in that list. Perfect consistency with right amount of sweetness and dry fruits. Amazing is the word. 
Cant wait to try their butter chicken and the other amazing dishes that they have. I cant believe i have a new favourite north indian restaurant in town.",5,"2019-04-25 03:38:37",81,64,3
"60967223","This was a totally unplanned visit to the restaurant. We ordered:-
1. Paneer Bhurji (I'd have preferred with a little more gravy but that's a personal preference)
2. Schezwan Fried rice (It is spicy as expected and be ready to get your tongue rolling)
3. Tawa roti and gobi paratha
4. Shikanji (The standard nimbu sharbat)
Overall the food is delicious, the ambience is a unique dhaba style setting and the service is very good. Would definitely visit again..!!",5,"2019-04-20 19:58:38",6,0,1

"373093","The phone number given here is wrong. We had our lunch here and ordered chur chur naan, dilli de parathe, chaas and pan lassi. Green chutney with parathe was delicious and there were 3 types of parathe- nimbu Mirchi, aaloo and pyaaz. Our lassi was not cold but when spoken to owner Mr. Sandeep Singh he replaced with colder one. Nice gentleman to be in hospitality business.
Must try place, with fultoo Desi ambience and Punjabi songs.

"38201383","A fantastic Punjabi place located just opposite Gachibowli flyover. The ambience is good but nothing lavish though the food is extraordinary.
I was there with my squad and we were craving North Indian Punjabi Food and Punjabi Swag was at our rescue. The food was very delicious.
We started off with Malai Tandoori Chicken, Paneer Tikka, Murgh Reshmi Kebab, Fish Amritsar, Nimbu Mirch Chicken, Crispy Corn, Papad Paneer, Schezwan Prawns, Chur-Chur Naan, Dilli Waale Swag Parathe and Paneer Bhurjee te Naal Pao as appetizers followed by amazing Like with various flavours including Pan, Green Apple, Aam, Blueberry and Plain. Malai Tandoori Chicken is a new concept and was absolutely delightful. Schezwan Prawns and Parathe were brilliant as well. Tandoori was tender and grilled to perfection. Loved it.
For maincourse we had Boneless Butter Chicken, Mutton Masala, Dal Makhani, Lacha Paratha and Butter Garlic Naan. My favourite was Butter Chicken with Garlic Naan which was creamy and cooked well.
We were already so full, just had Gulab Jamun as dessert and it was fabulous, soft and sweet which summed up our amazing dinner.
Service by Tanmay was quick and his recommendations played a big role for us to enjoy the feast. As my friends live nearby, they enquired about Home Delivery and were informed that the place is known by CHAKHH DE PUNJAB exclusive on zomato only.
Overall, an exclusive affordable and delicious Punjabi Cuisine Restaurant in the midst of Gachibowli. A must try for their wonderful food.",5,"2019-03-17 17:29:48",129,599,10

"52831427","Punjabi food to the lovers of this cuisine. The place is designed to give a Dhaba style ambience with the stereotyped witty Punjabi quotes on the walls and ‚ÄúCharpai‚Äù for seating, If you want to get a flavour of Punjab...go to this place.
The ambiance of the place is proper dhaba style with live counters for all the different types of breads and their names written on boards in quirky Punjabi language
The Punjabis Swag is famous for it's Punjabi dishes. Apart from Punjabi dishes they also serve Chinese and biryani. They also serve all kinds of Indian breads.
We have a handful of Dhaba themed restaurants now that serves authentic Punjabi food in Gachibowli
Then the owner of this restaurant Mr. Paresh had suggested us one more dish that is Dilli waale Swag Parathe. It was the just out of the sky! The taste I can never forget, thanks to Mr. Paresh who had suggested us this dish amazing
Next we had a couple of parathas, Chur-Chur naan and Dilli walle Swag parathe, served with the Punjabi Chole curry. Both of these were luscious and absolutely delicious. Then we had Paneer Bhurjee with Pao. A little different from the usual Pao Bhaji. It was quite good.
My favorite dishes, Malai Tandoori Chicken. This is my all-time favorite dish but here it was totally different, perfectly marinated and topped with malai. It was juicy, really amazing. Then we moved to some paneer-shaneer, we had Paneer Tikka. Large pieces, soft and tender to the core, it was very good
Our amazing dinner with the traditional sweet of Gulab Jamun.

"50311348","Hello Hyderabad! Here is another place for Punjabi Food on Gachibowli road where you can find amazingly delicious Punjabi food, patiyala style lassi with a friendly staff & an enthusiastic Chef that make it worth the visit.
We Visited on Friday night around 7pm to have some desi style food with lotsot of butter, ghee, and spices. The place was crowded with people and zomato delivery boys, anyhow we grabbed a seat to have their delicious food.
One thing you will love about this place is their menu, Oh Boy! their menu is more than sufficient to make your stomach roar with appetite. They put a wide range of North Indian Appetizers and Main course with the richness of Butter, Spices and Authentic taste.
We started our dinner with some of there delectable Starters: Malai Tandoori Chicken; To be Frank, I loved this Dish among all other dishes. Its perfect taste, aroma and softness made me feel out of this world. No one Can cook Malai Tandoori Chicken as good as Punjabi swag. Apne Hyderabadi mai bole toh - Angaar lagadiya ustaad ;) Fish Amritsar; Man, First of all I am a die hard fan of Fish, Spices, Good blend of taste and Aroma of Wood. Chef at Punjabi Swaag mixed it all and took it to the next level, seriously. Shezwan Prawns; One Word, Perfectly Cooked with Equal Blend of taste. Err sorry more than one word. Then we ordered Paneer Tikka and Murgh Reshmi Kebab, both had Smokey flavour and Different blend of Spices which gives you a strong punch.
In the Main Course we had their famous Butter Chicken, Mutton Masala and Dal Makhani with Lacha Paratha and Butter Garlic Naan, all were really good and Cooked on I think Wood which gave them some mild aroma of it, all were toothsome and Succulent.
We ended our amazing dinner with the traditional sweet of Gulab Jamun. It was a perfect end.

"29112231","Yet another place for Punjabi food on the stretch of gachibowli road were some amazingly and delicious Punjabi food is being served with some (patiyala) style love being added to food and service.
Appetizers:
Kheema pav: It's one of my favourite dish which I love it to the core and this place makes it the way I liked it.
Paneer bhurji pav: The paneer need lite seasoning on it other wise the taste was as good as kheema pav.
Malai tandoori chicken: No one can cook tandoori chicken as perfect as Punjabis. It was lips smacking dish.
Chole with Paneer bhature: Yaar first of all I am die hard fan of chole bhature and now you have added paneer to it. The taste has gone to next level seriously I can still feel the bhature taste on my taste buds.
Chur Chur naan: I have tried it at many other places were they serve some amazing and decent Chur Chur naan but here it was super flakey and the best part was dry fruits stuffing.
Main course:
Paneer curry and veg Patiala both the dishes has same taste gravy the only thing that differentiates this two was presentation the paneer gravy has bhurji and veg Patiala has paneer wrapped in egg.
Brevages: We had different types of lassi in different size
We had pan lassi, rose lassi, normal lassi and dry fruits. Except pan all were delicious. They also got lassi pitcher for lassi lovers.

"33916626","One look at The Punjabis Swag menu is sufficient to give you the goosebumps and to make your stomach roar with appetite! They put amazing north-west frontier food on your plate with all its rich flavors and authentic taste. I had visited this amazing place with a few of my friends, and we had one the most richest experiences.
The ambiance of the place is proper dhaba style with live counters for all the different types of breads and their names written on boards in quirky Punjabi language. The seating is ample for all types of gatherings. A unique feature of the restaurant is that they give water absolutely free of cost, no matter how many bottles you drink. It's a very powerful thing. Love it!
We started our dinner with some of the most amazing starters; Malai Tandoori Chicken, Murgh Reshmi Kebab and Nimbu Mirch Chicken. Malai Tandoori Chicken was rich and creamy, and Murgh Reshmi Kebab & Nimbu Mirch Chicken were juicy and succulent. From the seafood section, Fish Amritsar was crunchy from the outside and soft on the inside. And Shezwan Prawns were perfectly Chinese.
In vegetarian, Paneer Tikka had a nice smoky flavor to it, while Papdi Paneer was something very different than usual. It was covered in papad that gave the perfect crunch.
Punjabi cuisine is never complete without having the popular Lassi. We had a couple of flavors; plain, Green Apple, Pan, Aam (Mango) and Blueberry. All of these amazing, but I personally liked Mango and Green Apple a lot. It was a necessary refreshment to have before moving onto the heavier dishes.
Next we had a couple of parathas, Chur-Chur naan and Dilli walle Swag parathe, served with the Punjabi Chole curry. Both of these were luscious and absolutely delicious. Then we had Paneer Bhurjee with Pao. A little different from the usual Pao Bhaji. It was quite good.
In the main course we had Butter Chicken boneless, Mutton Masala and Dal Makhani curries, coupled with Lacha Paratha and Butter Garlic Naan. All of these curries were rich and creamy and were very scrumptious with the breads.
We ended our amazing dinner with the traditional sweet of Gulab Jamun. It was a perfect end. The service was very prompt and courteous, mostly done by Tanmay. We had a great time and can't wait to visit again.
FYI, for dine in the place is called THE PUNJBIS SWAG, while on Zomato it is CHAKHH DE PUNJAB. So keep in mind when you order your food or search.",5,"2019-03-09 17:27:15",57,1122,11

"327798","Gachibowli is the ever-bustling place filled with places who serve delicious food. Punjabi Swag is another addition to that and is from the house of Chakhh de Punjab. The ambiance is full of Punjabi from a couple of charpai seating, with lightning and nice funny Punjabi quotes all along the wall. 
We were here for early dinner, but it was full by the time we were done. 
Every dish on the menu is under 300 bucks with a good portion size. We started with peeli mirch paneer tikka, a flavorful paneer starter which was just lip-smacking good. The Phuljari Kebab, came with mint chutney and onions - another good starter. The Fish Amrita right was wonderful as well with pepper and red salt seasoning. The Nimbu mirch tandoori chicken, was juicy and packed with flavours.  The Kaali mirch paneer tikka, had a overpowering taste of the black pepper and it was spicy. 
The Keema Pao is a must try dish here with the perfect balance of flavors. We also had Malai Tandoori Chicken, which was beautiful and was dripping malai  all throughout. Also, don't forget to try out the Lassi here. They have a lot of variety and all of them are equally good. 
For the main course we had  this amazing Ludhianvi Chicken with Butter Naan. Everything was laden with so much richness and flavors, that it was even hard to stop. 
Overall the place is good and serves you food that can stir your inner Punjabi. Otherwise everyone is humble and service was not great but eventually with time, they will be. Go give it a try.",5,"2019-02-28 13:47:21",482,1686,16

"15416931","'Dieting? What?'
Food - let me get this straight, it doesn't get better than this! Everything on the menu under 300 bucks, huge portion size and the desi feel in here makes it just the perfect spot to enjoy some really good Indian food! We were guests here and now I'm also a returning customer, let me take you through the dishes I loved!
Peeli mirch paneer tikka, you can feel the mirch in it, a power packed paneer starter will lighten up your taste buds! Phuljari Kebab, this veg offering with some mint chutney and onions is another great veg option. Fish Amritsari, deep fried fish seasoned with pepper and red salt was delectable! Nimbu mirch tandoori chicken, was tender, flavourful even on the inside and had a great portion size! Kaali mirch paneer tikka, the black pepper was over powering everything, not my cup of tea. Keema Pao, #musttry here, the pao was soaked in butter and the keema was just so subtle, I loved it and have been going back again and again for this! Malai Tandoori Chicken, a beauty to look at because we all know the malai factor always lags in malai tandoori chicken, but not here, it was soaked in it and had the flavour to the bone!
The lassi gets a special shoutout here, chota, bada, usse bhi bada, are the three glass sizes and the biggest one costs ‚Çπ160 and is almost 700 ml of a serving, they have a variety of lassis like badam, kesari etc, #mustry2 here!
The main course was very pleasing to look at and I just kept looking because I was tremendously full with whatever I had upfront! I tasted this amazing Ludhianvi Chicken with Butter Naan, it was rich in flavours and a perfect main course offering! Overall food gets a solid 10/10!
Ambiance - It's a task locating this place as the sign board is pushed inwards from the road. Anyways, the whole set up feels like a classic dhaba with metal chairs and tables, you also get seating on the beds which we see on dhabas. On the right there's a live counter where roti, keema pav etc are made and with all this noise they have some amazing bollywood numbers playing in the background! It'll light up your mood in no time and trust me you'll feel a bit more desi in here! I'd recommend them setting up the entrance pathway correctly, it's muddy and not well maintained, they're new and I reckon they'll get everything done soon! 8/10 for ambiance!
Service - The staff here is a little quite yet nimble, as afore-mentioned, they're new and eventually everything will fall in place. The tables weren't getting cleared often and the new walk-ins weren't being attended abruptly, which has to be fixed asap. Otherwise the people are humble and the owner himself holds together. Service for now gets 7/10!

"71442666","If you're looking for authentic punjabi cuisine where people are enthusiastic to serve good punjabi food with a positive and happy vibe, then The Punjabis Swag is the place for you.
What I loved the most about it was its dhaba theme. I'm huge fan of dhaba's, and this place has a typical dhaba touch to it with punjabi quotes everywhere and an open kitchen.
STARTERS
I don't think I need to mention what was served as the welcome drink. Ofcourse, it's Lassi, an irreplaceable Punjabi favourite. They had 4-5 different flavours of Lassi and my pick was the Rose Lassi.
The next thing we tried was the Kheema Pav and let ne tell you, the Kheema was actually lip smacking delicious.
Malai Tandoori Chicken was one of my favourites. The chicken dipped in malai gravy is simply a treat for your taste buds.
Punjabi Swag Paratha is stuffed paratha with chole. It was decent enough.
Chole with Paneer Bature tasted well but the chole were a bit towards the salty side.
Chur Chur Naan was the star dish of the night, stuffed with paneer and dryfruits, it's just perfect in taste.
Fish Amritsari is crunchy pieces of well fried fish, another favourite.
MAIN COURSE
Paneer and Veg Patiala - Both the dishes were decent enough, with paneer wrapped up in an omelette and presented with rich gravy, while the veg patiala was served with papad and gravy.
For dessert we had Mitti Roti which reminded me of my childhood, as I've always been fond of it.
From the starters till desserts everything tasted very good and hospitality from the management is just an added plus point. They make sure that you are comfortable from the moment you step in.",4,"2019-02-14 19:38:21",51,71,8
"281814","The place gives u a complete dhaba experience with ambience and food.
We were a group and got to try lots of different things.
Starters
Amritsari Fish - Crispy on the outside and flavourful inside the fish was perfectly cooked served alongside coriander chutney was the best
Nimbu Mirch Tandoori Chicken - One of the good tandoor dishes this was quite succulent juicy chunks of chicken perfectly marinated and cooked in clay Owen
Peeli Mirch ka Paneer Tikka - Soft cubes of Paneer probably prepared freshly in the dhaba itself was unique and delicious
Prawn Schezwan - Prawns was spicy and and yummy . Served with dollop of Schezwan sauce.
Malai Tandoori Chicken - Leg pieces cooked in Calgary Oven and garnished with Malai sauce was something different and good. Never had dish quite served like this before .
Kheema Pav - One of the must try dishes in this place. Kheema was perfectly spicy and served with punch of flavour.
Main course
Chur chur naan with chole - A pretty heavy dish , this can certainly fill ur tummy u got to try this as a separate meal in itself.
Paneer Patiyala - paneer dish served with a wrapped omelette on top was interesting and quite delicious .
Ludhianwi chicken - Soft boneless cubes of chicken in a thick gravy sauce was a perfect dish complimenting the breads. This is also a must try.
Desserts
Lassi Platter - if you are Keen to taste the array of lassi in offer have the platter you won't be dissapointed.",5,"2019-02-13 10:21:25",209,3003,7
"1518372","Another gem from the area of Gachibowli. Newbie alert in the town. The Punjabi Swag is from the house of Chakhh de Punjab, it's located on busy streets of Gachibowli with an open area covered with green carpets. The ambience is out an out retro style with a couple of charpai seating, with colourful lightning & nice funny Punjabi quotes which gives you a rustic feel of dhaba in this concrete jungle. We were here for early dinner, the place was desserted by the time we reached, but in no time the restaurant was fully packed with customers. There's an open kitchen where you could see that your food is being made in front of you like Kheema Pav, tala hue paratha, etc..
Coming to the food we had started with "" Amritsari Fish"" fish cut into slices, marinated well in batter & deep fried until it becomes golden brown in colour. The fish tasted amazing, it was crispy enough, perfectly cooked. ""Nimbu mirch tandoori chicken"" chicken perfectly marinated and cooked in clay pot oven till perfection & garnished with little bit of pepper & lemon juice. It tasted good, felt little bit dry. ""Peeli mirchi Paneer tikka"" paneer well coated with masalas shallow fried. It tasted amazing with the masala coating. ""Prawn schzewan"" prawns tossed well in schzewan sauce, other spices. It tasted yummy with tinge of spiceness & tinge of sweetness. ""Kalimirchi Paneer tikka"" it was decent. "" Malai tandoori chicken"" today's one of the star dishes, chicken well marinated & cooked in clay pot oven & granished with a lots of malai on it, to get the richness of malai to it. ""Phuljari Kebab"" an upgraded version of hara bara kebab, perfectly minced veggies & few leafy vegetables mixed well & kneaded into dough, few of the dough is taken, made flat & deep fried until golden brown in colour, which makes it outer region crispy & inner region soft. ""Delhi wale tale hue swag paratha"" paratha tawa fried in lots of ghee, with paneer stuffing in it which tasted amazing. ""Paneer Bature with chole"" tasted amazing with richness of ghee in it. I felt the cholee curry was bit salty in all the combos. Next comes the show stopper ""Kheema Pav"" minced mutton cooked well with spices & richness of ghee & butter along with pav which goes absolutely amazing. I would come again for this dish. ""Chur Chur Naan"" it was also yummy.
For the Main course we had ""Peeli mirch ke lacchaa paratha"" & ""Garlic naan"" along with ""Chicken Ludhiana"", ""Paneer Patiyala"" & ""Veg Patiyala"". Chicken Ludhiana was creamy, tastier were as gravy was thick enough. Paneer Patiyala where paneer prepared in green chilli paste, wrapped in an Omlette along with thick, rich creamier gravy. Veg Patiyala is the same but presented well in an masala papad.
How can we leave an Punjabi dhaba without tasting their delicious lassi, as they have wide varieties of lassis as well as ""Lassi Platter"". They have different varieties of lassi like ""blueberry lassi, paan lassi, Patiyala lassi"".
Well that was a huge dinner for us with lots of ghee, love & lots of memories with us. Fish Amritsari, malai chicken tandoori, Phuljari Kebab, chicken Ludhiana are the best dishes recommended by Hydfoodie

"132137","Punjabi Food has been available for quite some time in Hyderabad, but what made it interesting and more popular is the introduction of Dhaba themed outlets, because Punjabi food is best enjoyed at Dhabas. We have a handful of Dhaba themed restaurants now that serves authentic Punjabi food. And I must say most of them are doing a great job.
The latest entrant is Punjabi's Swag at Gachibowli which is from the house of Chak De Punjab, an already popular name in the city. Punjabi's Swag again gives you vibes of a typical Punjabi Dhaba with old school decor, bright colors and of course the big-hearted heavy Punjabi food!
On one side of the hall, you can see live counters preparing mouth-watering stuff like Keema Pav, Bhurji Pav, Fried Parathas and much more!
The entire place is full of graffiti featuring Punjabi madness!
Overall the ambiance of the place is catchy loud and suits the kind of food served.
We started with a lassi that was served in small shots-like glasses. I had Gulab Lassi and it was perfect.
The first starter was Peeli Mirch Ka Paneer Tikka. It was a perfect starter with soft paneer and subtly spicy flavors.
Nimboo Mirch Tandoori chicken waTandooriri chicken with some extra spice. It was perfectly grilled and spiced but i found it a little dry and hard to chew.
Fish Amritsari was just perfect. Crispy and meaty fish slices that were not smelly. It was an amazing starter.
Schezwan Prawns was a let down as the prawns were not fresh. They were chewy and hard to bite into.
The star of the evening was Keema Pav. The keema was so flavourful and spicy, it was the best keema i had at a non-hyderabadi restaurant. A must try!
Then there was Malai Tandoori Chicken which was one delicious starter. Tandoori Chicken topped with a yummy cheese and yogurt sauces, it had a soothing taste to it. The second best starter of the day.
The Punabi Swag Paratha is one heavy form of Parathas. The already oily, stuffed parathas are again fried in ghee! Could only take a bite of it as i had already stuffed myself with so much. But the next time i go there, i'm gonna start with it.
Chhole Bhature here is also one of the best i had. The chhole was amazingly tangy and spicy!
For the main course, we had Paneer Patialam Veg Patiala and Ludhianvi Chicken. Paneer and Veg Patiala were presented like the continental main course and they both tasted great with Butter naan. Chicken Ludhanvi was also full of flavours.
We ended the feast with Chocolate Parathas and Sweet Parathas. Sweet Parathas made me nostalgic as it reminded me of the Meethi Rotis i used to carry in my lunch box!
Overall we have another place that serves great Punjabi food! The ambiane is the best part. Nothing fancy, still great! The starters are amazings specially the keema pav!",4,"2019-02-11 00:41:34",222,3013,17
"32779743","This is a Punjabi Dhaba themed restaurant started by people who are Punjabi at heart and have passion to serve some delicious Punjabi food to the lovers of this cuisine. The place is designed to give a Dhaba style ambience with the stereotyped witty Punjabi quotes on the walls and ‚ÄúCharpai‚Äù for seating.
Apart from a variety of Punjabi dishes, they also have Indo-Chinese items on the menu. In starters, we had Tandoori Chicken, Amritsari Fish, Malai Tandoori Chicken, Phuljari Kebab, Schezwan Prawns, Reshmi Kebab and Paneer Tikka. Except Reshmi Kebab, which I felt was dry and not juicier as I like it to be, all other starters were great. Especially the Malai Tandoori Chicken was finger-licking good with juicy malai flavor on the top
.
In main course, we had Kheema Pav, Chur Chur Naan with Chole, Paneer Bhature with Chole, Paneer Patiala, Veg Patiala and Ludhiana chicken. The Kheema Pav was mindblowing, I loved the Kheema which was cooked perfectly in spices. Chur Chur Naan was also great and went with Chole.
A Punjabi Dhaba is absolutely incomplete without Lassi and here they serve it in many flavors and sizes too, perfect to end a delicious Punjabi meal !!
Overall this a great place to satisfy your cravings for some delicious Punjabi food ! ",4,"2019-02-11 00:00:37",169,1259,8

Good Punjabi flavours this is the place to be.
The ambience is that of a dhaba with simple seating.coloured flyers and painted walls.
On a mid weekday , this place with packed with people.
Food:
Starters:
Nimbu mirch tandoori chicken was one of my favourite.Well spiced , rich flavours and cooked to perfection.
Keema pav was one of dishes I will go back for , loaded with spices and well cooked seems served with pav.
Peeli mirch paneer tikka: strong mustard flavour , with soft paneer , the paneer on its own felt little bland but the complete bite with the coating had a blast of flavour.
Amritsari fish was fried fish and was very soft.
Kali mirch paneer tikka had too much black pepper in it.
Malai chicken tikka was creamy yet not sweet , tasted well.
Reshmi kebab had good flavour ,but was little dry and chewy.
Mains:
Swag wale parathe were fried parathas served with cholle(the cholle were delicious)
Stuffed bhauture with cholle (generous pander filling inside )
Chur chur naan , had layers loaded with ghee ,it was heavy and I was almost full by the time I could taste , so couldn't ear much to tasted great.
Lundhianwi chicken had a mild spiced gravy which tasted well.",4,"2019-02-08 10:55:00",237,1070,10

"39975834","If you want to get a flavour of Punjab...go to this place. Ordered butter chicken, butter naan, kadhai paneer...and the flavours are really good. The Kesar lassi is also nice. One should definitely go to this restaurant if missing north indian food. The service is also fairly good here. The ambience is also nice.

Food : 3/5
It is situated at prime location just next to Gachibowli flyover. The interior resembles a roadside dhaba. It is a big property but still all the tables were occupied (expect slight delays in sitting).
Service was upto the mark. Staff was helpful and friendly. The place was chaotic but I guess these guys have found a balance in the chaos.
We did ordered thalis which was supposedly a combo of various items on the menu. It was heavy and we struggled to finish our indivisible plates. Taste of the food was okayish, probably just above average.",3,"2018-10-26 00:20:54",23,94,2

Service - 3/5
Food - 4/5 for the item Paneer butter masala combo.
Paneer butter masala was too good. Right amount of sweetness and hotness. Paneer was soft.
Dal, aloo jeera, raita, roti and gulab juman were good.
Disappointing was peas pulao. Rice was half cooked and not at all edible.",3,"2018-10-16 09:15:48",30,14,1

"2698588","Proper Punjabi dhaba-
Ambiance-
The Punjabis Swag is located on the roadside near Gachibowli flyover. The Punjabis Swag is a proper dhaba- with less expenditure on ambiance and more focus on quality and quantity of food. They have tandoor and serving area near sitting area. Only outdoor sitting is available having normal tables and chairs. They play Punjabi songs in the background. They serve food in colorful dishes.
Food-
The Punjabis Swag is famous for it's Punjabi dishes. Apart from Punjabi dishes they also serve Chinese and biryani. They also serve all kinds of Indian breads. We ordered veg manchaow soup, which was perfect in taste and quantity. We also ordered Chicken Patiyala which is the most famous and must try dish. Cooked in red gravy, a good number of chicken pieces and eggs, which tasted good with butter naans.
