But this time, I knew Greens n More in Hyderabad. It was much easier and convinient for me to order for a meal rather than end up eating the pre cooked food from any other restaurants.
The food tastes amazing, interestingly each and every ingredients used were fresh. It's refreshing to have fruits and salads nicely cut and packed for your meals during office work. The packaging was good. Well thought menu and surprisingly different tastes in meals to soothe the taste buds. I am quite impressed with the concept. ",5,"2019-05-18 00:47:04",15,64,4
