Ambiance-
Mumbai's very famous Chotemiyan Kebabs has one of it's outlet in newly opened Stringz Drive In near Gowlidoddy. The sitting area is common for all the restaurants inside Drive In.
Food-
As the name suggests this restaurant is famous for Kebabs and also serves Mandi and Sizzlers. We placed an order Barbeque Chicken Tikka Kebab cost approximately INR 249 containing about 6-7 barbeque chicken kebabs which were served with onion salad, pudina chutney and mayonnaise. Afterwards, we placed an order for Tandoori Wings cost approximately INR 269 had 6 chicken Tandoori wings. We also placed an order for barbeque grilled chicken and barbeque grilled chicken Mandi, both were perfect in taste and quantity.
Service-
Service was average and the staff was unattractive.",4,"2018-11-21 03:10:24",101,332,4

Chotemiya kebab at stringz drive is one of the best kebabs. I was already full and had actually visited to have only drinks. But the owner of chotemiya kebab told me to try one item that is special and as well as famous. He served me Gun Powder Chicken and I was blown away. It was fantastic! The taste and style was perfect, with a little crunch on the outside and soft inside and not much spicy.
I loved this so I wanted to have more so they told me to try their another kebab dish. This was also really good and delicious, well marinated and properly cooked.
Then they said one more dish but I was very full. So they just brought in their Chicken Sizzler which was really something else. It was served with rice, fries and few sauces. It looked very delicious.
This was like a dinner, and every dinner ends with a dessert so I ordered one brownie with vanilla ice cream because I love browine.
Everything was perfect and I really loved chotemiya kebab at stringz drive. It's a must visit place to hangout with friends.",5,"2018-10-02 10:58:14",28,1624,5

We tried the Gun Powder Chicken, Chicken Tikka and Paneer Sizzler on their recommendation. Gun Powder Chicken was outstanding, it was tender and soft inside and crispy on the outer side. Their special sauce to go with it was just what was needed.
Chicken Tikka was filled with spices and I loved every bite of it. Special mention to their Sizzler's which are priced on the lower side compared to others while they taste Fantastic.
Wonderful work by Yashwant who has done a great job. This place is a must try for their lip smacking food and chilled out ambience of Stringz Drive In.",5,"2018-10-01 13:37:56",129,599,5
