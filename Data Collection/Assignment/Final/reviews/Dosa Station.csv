"33905377","This is my guilty pleasure.Their cheese capsicum dosa is so fulfilling and so is their butter onion tomato uttapam. But weirdly enough the real winner for me is their ground nut chutney coz god damn that tastes so good.
You should try their puri.. It tastes amazing!!! ",5,"2018-04-01 15:52:31",97,97,1

"1853730","My first time...but never a last time ..to visit this placeðŸ˜‹. One of the best options for breakfast in the ISB road where you'll find a widespread of dosas as the name says ! ðŸ˜€
MUST TRYs 
- Pizza dosa: you are a pizza lover or not...you will love this flavor of dosa. It has a cheese filling with chopped capsicum, carrots, onions and tomatoes. Definitely was a  mouth melting  one for me. 
- Tawa idly: I have tried tawa idly at many places, but this is one of my favorites. The flavor of the chutney powder used is very different and delicious. 
The chutneys and sambar were also very good, especially the peanut chutney. ",4.5,"2017-12-31 10:08:42",61,261,0
