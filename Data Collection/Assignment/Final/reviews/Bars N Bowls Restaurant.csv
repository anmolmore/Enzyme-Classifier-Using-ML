"8553551","Only good thing about this place is Chicken Fried rice and the hospitality. Not for having good times. Just to have a quick meal and leave.. ",3,"2019-05-11 22:51:32",124,328,0
"45688758","Wanna crack open some cold ones with your buddies?? This is the place to go. Great ambience great service and reasonable rates. But the only drawbacks are that from the menu only selected dishes are good, and service sometimes gets crappy. Would recommend you to avoid this place if u out with girls.

"855881","Food is pathetic. Order anything and it disappoints you. Its basically a desi 'ahaata', if you get what I mean. You may find liquor a little cheaper than regular bars, and an AC seating ofcourse. Nothing better.",2,"2018-11-15 12:58:21",30,79,0
"47851579","We were bored of regular eateries in financial district so decided check out the Gowlidoddy area and ran into this place for lunch. Food was average and so was the service, long waiting time even when there was no crowd...Will not visit again and don't recommend it either.",1,"2018-04-29 12:05:44",40,78,0

"2388974","Ambience - 
This place is a 2 storied place. One floor is Air conditioned but since cigarettes are allowed so you can imagine the aura of smoke in a closed room with ac on. Top floor is non AC, with limited table fans available. So if you are lucky u can get a fan
Service- 
It's slow and non friendly!
Starters-
Ultra spicy!!! Even if you say not to put spice, it's still spicy. Quantity is low
Music - Not available
TV screen for sports - Yes
Parking - it's an issue here... bars and bowls has limited parking space, maybe for 3-4 cars max!! Nearby, it's all hostels whose security guards doesn't allow park in front of their pg...",1.5,"2017-04-23 07:55:50",144,673,0

"7406441","This place is a bit inside of Gachibowli near Q City. This is a bar cum restaurant. The drinks collection is normal and not that great. Bilut the Mutton pulao is the gem here. The service is not great. The cost is pocket friendly. But overall the ambience is not that good.",3,"2017-01-13 08:58:21",194,2048,0

"14541441","This place is a good example of serving alcohol at cheap prices and good food.
Although, I have visited this place mainly for drinking, I like the starters from this place.
Chicken salt and pepper,varieties of kebab can be considered as great starters with alcohol.",3.5,"2016-08-02 18:11:12",685,792,0
"29568723","So this place is multistoried but we went to the family restaurant section. The place is small, seating capacity for inly 4 groups but is comfortable. The menu is confusing and it was so difficukt for me to decide onto what to order. I had paneer tikka, whichwas an absolute delight, it was spicy, tangy and full of flavours. My friend tried the chicken soft noodles that looked like having more chicken pieces than noodles. It was a heavy bowl of noodles. Having said that, ghe food looked great, smelled gread, was presented well and tasted awesome.
P.S.:  I just peeked into the side grouos plate and they were eating chicken and mutton biryani and boy oh boy even that looked super delicious from my angle. I guess it was hyderabadi dum biryani.
Do try this place and maybe this woukd become your weekend adda owing to the bar present on the other floor",3.5,"2016-05-23 00:57:50",50,772,0
"296743","I've been taking parcel from here on and off , the food is nice and tasty , here's what i like about them -
Bone less Mutton Biryani - This is really yummy and is at par with Biryani's being served at many Biryani Specialist restaurants in hyderabad..
Apollo Fish - Pretty good, crisp and tasty.
Tandoori Chicken - Excellent
Chicken Drumsticks - Again really yummy, 
Tasty Food at affordable price.
Service is also decent.",3.5,"2016-03-29 11:01:02",3,94,0
"31668088","I believe a place serving alcohol can never be rated bad till they really screw up .
This place is near financial district ...A place to hang out after office ...The place is cheap and serves average food.
Don't go dere with a lot of expectations and you will end up liking the place .",3.5,"2016-02-29 18:12:29",126,277,0
"434085","This place is in vicinity of Nallagandla, a going-to-be-developed sector near Gachibowli. The place is spread over two floors of the same building. 1st floor is the multicuisine restaurant and upper fooor is the bar.
Overall, this is a good place to hang out with friends. Prices of drinks and food are very competitive, and the quantity and quality of food is also good. Service is no-nonsense and quick. Staffs are pretty courteous and came back repeatedly to our tabke to serve food or refill the drink. If someone wants a quite drink or get together with friends, this is an ideal place.",4,"2016-02-24 23:29:47",320,833,2
"3053087","Bars N Bowls at Nanakramguda!
We went for the bar section and glad to see a neat ambiance unlike the regular bars. Well cushioned & comfortable seating with ample space - liked the way space is not cramp. 
Visited this for a quick bite at 10.30 PM ... Asked for chicken fried rice and chicken wet manchuria. The fried rice had a generous quantity of egg but the taste was too bland. Unless it is mixed with wet manchuria, it was tasteless. Chicken Manchuria was good..not too spicy and the chicken was well cooked.
Overall, a neat place(i am referring to the bar section) maintained well and a decent bar to hangout!!!mysticalfoodie.com",3,"2016-01-29 15:07:56",211,1366,2
"771866","My reviews would contain a brief background about the ambience, pros and cons of the food, and what best to eat. But kindly excuse the nature of my review this time. This place Bars N Bowls is a big NO NO.
They served STALE food!
The staff also had the guts to charge me for it despite complaining about the stinky stale chicken biryani. They were in a complete denial.
My advise is, folks kindly don't waste your time and money here.",1,"2015-12-29 13:51:13",10,9,0
"32869292","This place has good ambience but the hospitality is too bad. Food is costly and taste is decent , If you are in desperate need of some space in Gowlidodi to sit visit here . My choice will never be this to suggest you",1,"2015-12-24 02:55:05",24,129,0
"30817270","Went to bars and bowls with my friends couple of times. I should say that it had reached the expectations. The starters were very tasty and all other recipes were good. The ambience was good but not excellent. The hospitality and the service was really good .Enjoyed the food while watching live cricket match ( Ind vs Sa) . ",4,"2015-12-16 18:24:09",2,21,0
"32073290","Visited the place with a group of 8. We ordered the biryani family pack. Waited for 45 minutes for our order to be served. After all the wait, we get very spicy food. That tasted like a mouthful of spice. Felt totally burnt of time, money and appetite.",1.5,"2015-11-17 22:54:56",1,0,0

"32114843","I was planning for a team lunch, we were 50 members..  As our office is near to wipro gachebowli, I checked few places and found only 3 economical options
1 TGrill
2 Angara
3 Bars and Bowls 
This time I thought of trying the 3rd option as others are too crowded to accommodate 50 members..
In simple words this restaurant is superb.. Very very good food, tasty, hot, Crispy, service refill is speedy.. 
Everyone was satisfied with every item served. There was around 4 Non veg items, soups, starters, tasty veggies and 3 deserts.. 
The rate for the buffet was very reasonable, made me not to bargain on final bill. 
Kudos to the team who served, no empty vesels, refilled with in seconds of time. 
Finally my colleagues are happy and enjoyed.  What else required. 
Thanks team for the experience. You people made my day. ",5,"2015-10-07 22:19:37",2,0,0
"31859932","Decent food. Good quantity. Good prices. They take spicy a little too seriously here, so you might wanna tell them to go easy on that.

"620390","Went to Bars n Bowls tonite as an experiment to check out all restaurants in and around Nallagandla . 
Ambience : Decor reminds one if the yesteryears Dance bars in Mumbai , low white sofa sets low lighting , etc.interesting choice of Wallpapers. 
Service : It was swift, not to sure if that was because there were only three tables occupied . So benefit of doubt goes to the resturant .
Food: We ordered very basic food , masala peanuts , masala papad and a egg biryani takeaway. The masala peanuts were soggy , the masala papad , was in parts exceedingly salty and covered with only tomatoes . I always thought that if done well masala papad can be sublime , tongue tickling and altogether exhilarating , these did not come close . 
Alcohol : Can't really complain about the alcohol , though I would like to try but hate to shoot the messenger . For the kind of Resturant this is the pricing was definitely  way too high.
On an aside , the menu is fun reading , the mangurian seems worth a try even if it is for the spelling :-) 
Overall , does not seem to the place one goes to for a quick tipple,a good snack on the way home. 
To be fair to the restaurant, we did not order anything substantial so I may be a little skewed . So this review may be taken with a pinch of salt, from the masala papad :-) 
Egg Biryani: In my mind biryani's are classified into :a) mind altering b) great c) this is not biryani it is good fried rice d) fried rice , Tawa pulao is better e) where is the biryani ? 
The egg biryani ,falls into the d ) category it was flavourful but fried rice / Tawa pulao masquerading as a biryani. The .5 came from the masquerading fried rice. Otherwise this would be a brilliant 1 . :-)",1.5,"2015-08-25 00:43:18",8,66,0

Normally I would prefer to write pros and cons in my reviews but I am hesitating to do it here because
There is only a single word coming from my mouth
WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY TO BE HERE
I don't know how people wrote postive reviews to this but comparatively I was totally upset and please do not prefer it...Im not reverting or feeling different on previous reviews by my friends its their review but to be positive donot prefer this at all....

"15697596","Visited this place based on the reviews and let me tell you we were not disappointed at all. 
- Nice little place with good ambiance.
- Food was very delicious. All the varieties were very good.
- Service was very good.
- Buffet spread is reasonable but taste dominates it.
- Good value for money.
Drawback we felt was with the preparation time to refill the dishes. The quantity initially was very less and they took a lot of time to refill. Its just the starting point so may be they will improve on this in a while.
Again for people looking out for Budget buffet with the buffet price being at 299+taxes. Would not mind to visit this place again.",3.5,"2015-03-11 15:22:51",197,519,7
