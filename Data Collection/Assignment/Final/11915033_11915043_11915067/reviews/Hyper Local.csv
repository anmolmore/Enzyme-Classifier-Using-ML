We booked the dance floor with additional charges and have to say we had hell of a time dancing to the dj. Absolutely customer friendly service.

"71442666","Visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and I must say! One of the best places to party in and around kondapur. The place is huge and divided into 3 sections. Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.
If you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.
When it comes to food.
First dish was :
Green veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth.Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.
Moong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.
Chole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry.Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti¬† is just perfect at hyperlocal.
Had few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.
Chicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.
Chicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.
Heard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)
Over all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say. Fell in love with that area.",4,"2019-05-14 20:19:29",50,71,20

"31079661","Pathetic restuarant. I had to struggle even for getting a table. Once you pay cover charge you are on your own to struggle. They messed up with everything. I ordered chilly paneer they got me chilly chicken. I mean how can a restuarant do this. After that I had to ask manager atleast 3 4 times to get every order. It took them more then 45 minutes to get me my order. It was over crowded no space to dance so people were dancing near our table and drinks spell off 3 4 times. On complaining about this nobody was even bothered to check. And at last when I saw my bill almost 3 4 items were included which we never ordered. Horrible experience. I wasted my money time and energy. ",1,"2019-05-12 13:53:21",12,47,0

# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb üòí
# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.
# Food
#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent
#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels
#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...
#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!
#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!
#Experience
Incredible in one word....too good a musical fest...plenty of area (be it by the table or at the floor) for comfortably dancing...drinks enhanced the Italian experience...and it is a must visit place when the hangout is with Saturdayish buddies...",5,"2019-05-07 00:09:22",161,361,0

"466559","I and my friend went here to watch the IPL live screening and have some good time. One good thing was that they have 2+2 on drinks through Zomato gold. The food pretty decent too, but what I didn't like was that it didn't have good options in drinks, especially non-alcoholic. We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad. We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn't take it back. Wasn't happy with the service. 
Also the live music there wasn't great. ",3,"2019-05-04 20:00:50",63,260,1

"30548088","This was my second visit to the place and I am very disappointed for the following reasons:
1) The first time I visited they were not serving alcohol due to some license issue
I dicided to give it another shot and came again.
2) Ordered cheese chilli toast, never order it. It's as hard a a rock. Cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread
3) Ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me
4) DJ was pathetic. It was supposed to be ""Bollywood Hangover"" he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter's ear let alone having a conversation with your friends.
PS: If you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear, unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good DJ. You need feel the pulse of audience. ",2,"2019-05-03 21:56:15",12,48,0

"29299538","Pathetic experience I have had in recent times. Arrived for buffet at 2pm I. Saturday afternoon. The food was cold as ice, no starters at the food table and support staff least bothered about checking on food and customers.
The only thing that was severed as per it's level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience.
Until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold.
Later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience.
Will not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as option.

"22947237","Review :
Recently we've received an invitation from¬†Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of¬†SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:
Full Bar
Nightlife
Live Music
Private Dining Area Available
Wi-Fi
Live Sports Screening
Indoor Seating
Smoking Area
Buffet
If you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.
They are serving¬†IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza¬†where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.
Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special¬†mocktail¬†and¬†cocktail. First, they served¬†LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like¬†Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec.¬†and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.
The¬†mocktail¬†was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.
After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.
Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.
The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken¬†Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these¬†Sambousek¬†with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.
Now you might be wondering what¬†Baharat spice¬†is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.
I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.
Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5
Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5
Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5
As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.",5,"2019-04-24 17:23:29",16,668,5

"2452778","Monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have GOT being screened then things get better. Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are ""fancier than you are"". üòéüòâüôÇ
I ordered for üçÖüç∏ Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick üôÉüòúü§™ in first sip itself. The üçë üç∏ peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and üçÑ mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread üçû üòã.
It was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts.",4,"2019-04-23 21:43:38",70,2035,5

"20352664","Oh my God, what a horrible place. They have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar. And in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside. They serve cocktails, but I would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. Cocktails including lit (a glass of Ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this I've no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.
All this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!
Again that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- ""because its the highest priced drink!!"" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!
During all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.
Be aware people. Avoid this place.",1,"2019-04-06 12:16:02",6,59,0
"2027944","The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too. 
The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. The utilisation of the limited space is done well. A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set. 
Moving on to the food: we tried the newly launched Drudge menu. Priced at Rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. However if you are early I.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for ‚Çπ 799. 
They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food. 
The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler. The buffet Consisted of golgappe, Dahi bhalle, Sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, Dahi kachori, chole bhature, red Thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets. 
Golgappe, Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. Dahi kachori was a complete let down. 
The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average. 
Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp. 
The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation. 
Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy.
The chicken tikka pockets were dry.
The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well. 
Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct. 
The music was extremely loud for the place. 
Overall we had a below average Experience. 
Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2.5/5",3,"2019-04-06 00:44:08",250,1443,10

In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

Chholey calzone: A treat to the taste buds. Kulcha pockets filled with chholey.

"1700577","Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.
My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.
Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.
The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.
All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)",3,"2019-03-25 15:50:32",275,1978,0
"43495179","Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. Despite that it has a reputed name and hype.
The place is widely spread evenly with three sections. Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.
The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. The two sections are contrasting with each other. The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.
Hyper Local has introduced the trending ""Drunch"", a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm.
It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200/_.
The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.
The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.
Coming to food.... The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe, Papdi Chaat, Matar Kulche,
Chole Bhature, and Dahi Vade.
The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.
Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.
Drinks were amazing here. My personal favourite was Pina Colada, Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu.
Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience.
