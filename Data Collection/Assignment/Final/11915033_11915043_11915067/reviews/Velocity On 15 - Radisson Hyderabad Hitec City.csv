"38389923","This is a pool side terrace restaurant where you can drink and chill with your friends and have good time. Limited food and large drinks menu.  Maximum crowd is the people who staying at the hotel. But they won't let you go in or near the pool in the evenings. ",4,"2017-08-23 21:38:38",50,96,0
"1349101","Well this is one sad place which is rather empty excepting a few guests from the hotel.
I was here on the weekend and out of complete boredom came up for some beer and snacking. But after spending about 30 mins, I got this feeling that the room would be more comforting.
Maybe you would be better of if you were with a group of friends or if you were here at a small private party. The problem also is the limited out door seating around the pool.",1.5,"2017-08-23 14:14:01",186,13384,1

Hyderabad's first churascario, this place has a significant variety of gourmet items on the menu to choose from and the chef makes each one of them to absolute perfection. One of the very few places I have rated a 5 star in Hyderabad. ",5,"2017-06-18 19:19:59",70,92,0

It serves Brazilian cuisine. It also serves India's largest burger and trust me even 4 people can't complete that Burger, it's massive. Staff is good. Music is soft. Good place to have a conversation with a different cuisine experience.",4,"2017-06-17 07:31:33",29,257,0
