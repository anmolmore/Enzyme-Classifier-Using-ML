"42734784","Since my childhood, I've always been a fan of gongura with non veg and when I got to know that this place serves a good Gongura Biryani, thought of having it.
And then comes a day when I finally ordered it and guess what, as soon as you see it, you'll fall in love with the colour of biryani üòç Hopefully that is not an artificial colour. But coming to taste, it's awesome. Just lyk God is omnipotent, the flavour of Gongura is omnipresentüòâ I mean in every rice grain you can sense it. The chicken pieces too were very good. They are soft too as one my friends who has a fence to her teethüòú could eat those easily üòÇ
Tagged at a moderate price , quantity is quite sufficient.
If you're a lover of Gongura , then this a must try.
NOTE: I don't have any idea about ambience . My rating confined to Gongura biryani alone as I haven't had anything else from there.
P.S. I still have this doubt how the chef managed to get that color to the biryani ü§îü§îü§î",4,"2018-12-16 01:50:34",10,8,0

"52703080","I didn't¬†try too many things from here but Chicken Dum Biryani was good. Quantity was very good if you are a single person then it is too much and for two people it's not very enough you would need to get a shake or something with it. It's not like you will be hungry but you won't be full till neck(that's how I like eating biryani). If two persons¬†are just normal eater then it's a win-win.",4,"2018-10-14 11:58:00",4,8,0
