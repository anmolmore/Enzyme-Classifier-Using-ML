"67438951","This was the second worst experience i have had with indiblaze. After looking at the enormous rating provided by zomato to this restaurant I decided to order a grilled chicken mini bowl. The very first byte of food was so dissatisfying I couldn't continue Eating it. The misguided chicken mini bowl was as cold as ice and filled with nothing but lettuces and salad, there were hardly any pieces of chicken. I wonder if they have a stock full of red chilli powder, thanks to it which contributed to my stomach pain.
I didn't expect them to disappoint their customer in such a way.
Precisely if I have to say i got a bland,cold, tasteless salad in an overhyped price.",1,"2019-05-11 14:12:47",1,1,0
"29098695","This was the chicken wrap i reveived. Ordered for whole wheat bread, but it really didn't taste that way. There were 5 layers of bread and ONLY bread. Saucy and with some old chicken filling. Worst wrap i have ever had. ",1,"2019-05-02 13:18:42",15,6,1
"83295755","I ordered Paneer Biryani from Indiblaze. I had awesome experience, the food was very tasty and hot. Quantity and quality of the Biryani was very good. I loved the food and the price as well. Price of the Biryani is very nominal and with Zomato it's even cheaper. Thank you Zomato and Indiblaze.",5,"2019-04-29 16:06:50",9,1,0

"274006","Seems like the order they receive for delivery with instructions are read by illiterate people
After having repeatedly instructing to not make the food spicy. They intentionally give spicy food. After having called them and telling them to make the food non spicy, they are dead enough to not hear that out. Pathetic service. Food that is spicy enough to be good for third degree torture. Ignorant staff. Pure let down.. this is the maximum love I could give this filthy restaurant.",1,"2019-04-09 21:57:12",15,12,0

All it takes is just one mistake to loose that impression.I just ordered a spicy chicken hearty bowl through zomato. Within 15 minutes the food was delivered.I doubt if the box was made after the order was received. The food usually delivered warm is cold. I doubt if this was boxed many hrs ago. Really bad on you guys.",2,"2018-10-06 20:37:22",42,152,0

"2020038","Wanted to eat something light and healthy tonight and clearly ordering from here was a bad choice. I'd ordered a grilled chicken bowl. The chicken was undercooked and the meal tasted and looked like crap. I guess you can take the liberty to deliver just anything without maintaining standards because you dont have to bear the customer complaint face to face as they dine. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone. ",1,"2018-10-01 23:07:17",10,83,0

"35599292","When on diet, Indiblaze is the choice!
With very few healthy food options around the area of Gachibowli n Kondapur, Indiblaze does a good job!
Tried their chicken hearty minibowl and chocolate walnut fudge. And I must admit that they tasted great!
Chicken hearty minibowl comes with choice of rice (coriander butter/mixed grain), lettuce and beans. I opted for coriander butter rice with Himalayan black beans and iceberg lettuce. And you have got everything healthy in a single bowl, with jalapenos, olives, sweet corn, broccoli, almonds etc.
The quantity was good and I loved the taste! The chocolate fudge was yummy too!
Will definitely order again!",4,"2018-08-30 16:39:31",140,1523,3

Ordered Chicken Crispy Tenders, chicken biryani and wings. Everything was fresh and delectable.
Chicken wings was done perfectly right in barbeque sauce. Biryani had ample bite sized succulent chicken pieces. Biryani was just enough for two folks. Chicken tenders was crispy and yummy.
