When I tried to object I was cursed with terrible words which I can't even mention here. People , really u will fall sick if u order or eat from this place",1,"2019-02-24 02:34:17",6,74,0

"51485293","Worst food. Advice all people to never order from this place. Had ordered Schezwan chicken noodles, they were undercooked ,the noodles tasted sour for some reason. Felt the food was totally unfit for consumption.
Sincere advice for all foodies not to order from here ",1,"2018-12-28 15:31:18",8,2,0
