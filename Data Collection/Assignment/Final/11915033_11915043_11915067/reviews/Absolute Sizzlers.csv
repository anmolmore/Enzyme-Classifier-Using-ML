"52049410","When we first tried, that was 8months back.. the food taste and the quantity was good. Now they seems very much focused on offers not the quantity and quality of food. Very disappointed on my next two visits;They started reducing the quantity of the main dish in their Sizzlers, seems now the main dish is just for topping to attract.",3,"2019-05-18 09:18:23",10,3,0
"2974916","Visited for lunch today with colleagues and ordered one spicy chicken sizzler combo and two buffets. The buffet comes with veg and non veg sizzler , though without the sides (fries, veggies and noodles/rice). The buffet was decent though not great wrt variety and taste but the sizzler combo left us impressed with very good portions , perfectly cooked fresh chicken fillets loaded with veggies and garlic sauce. Would recommend the sizzler combo over the buffet. ",4,"2019-05-17 20:00:19",161,199,7

"30226262","I went here earlier some time back and was really impressed. Loved the sizzlers.. so I recommended it for a team lunch. They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.
If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.
Don’t think I would go back there again.",1,"2019-05-17 16:29:14",5,50,0

The server was rude, unpolite and refused to accept his mistakes and even manager to the same extent. There is no proper communication between chef and server.

"3032462","We had a very bad experience here. We have ordered Fish Shashilk and Sizzling Chicken sizzlers. The Fish Shashilk sizzler didn't have fish in it. Upon asking the waiter, he started searching the fish in my sizzler and was trying to make sure that I had already not eaten it. He then brought a grilled fish fillet and said that the sizzler can't be remade because the kitchen was quite busy. Upon arguing, another person came and changed my sizzler. I had visited this restaurant with lots of expectations as sizzlers are one of my favorites. Mistakes can happen anytime anywhere. It's an urge from side that please behave properly with the customers.
I would have given one star. But one extra star for the person who bothered to bring me a new sizzler.",2,"2019-04-08 23:54:52",146,332,1

During my last 2 visits I’ve tried a non veg Platter, 2-3 different types of non-veg Sizzlers, Tikka Pizza with add-ons like fries 🍟 n all.
While the food they serve is good but they could do better with service.
Service isn’t up to the mark , once your order is taken it’s lost somewhere until it really arrives at your table (after 20 mins ) and once the food is at your table the waiter will never show up again to ask if you need anything else or how’s the food??!!. Well not just that ask for a chutney or Mayonnaise or a water bottle you ain’t getting it until you call up to them couple of times.",4,"2019-04-01 08:26:44",1,3,0

I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no. of vegetables (maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out). Also, the ""smoked chicken"" needs to be upgraded.

"1458246","Had a lot of expectations when I read the ne for the first time. Was able to visit it after a month. 
What a disappointment it was. It's named sizzler but has nothing close to sizzler. You guys really need to work on the art of making sizzler. It looks like sizzler. It only looks",1,"2019-03-09 11:16:13",24,60,0

"41731248","I have had high expectations of food there but then my green salad with mint sauce was not very good. While the chicken wings I ordered were nice, but they ruined the American Chopsuey. It was more like eating a soupy noodles than a Chopsuey. I wish they would have made that better.
Ambience was good, staff were okay.",2,"2019-02-24 18:57:45",11,5,0

"447643","We visited the place for dinner and it was completely unplanned. The staff was very polite and helped us through the ordering process, suggested dishes and helped in other ways too. The food, I felt could have been better. It was mostly fusion sizzler which didn't just sit well with the general palate. For example, I wouldn't generally eat Schezwan sauce with mashed potatoes. Otherwise, it was a pretty nice experience. The ambience too was urban chic.",3,"2019-02-22 22:55:53",30,111,1
