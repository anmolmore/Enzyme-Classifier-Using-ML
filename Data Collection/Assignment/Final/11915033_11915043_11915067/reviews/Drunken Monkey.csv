"39571209","Well m giving a three star rating only because of a friendly staff and the concept n the cute monkey....which actually creates a wish to visit them again .
Otherwise the shakes have been pretty bad. I and my friend both were unhappy with our orders. The avacado shake n cold Irish coffee both jus made us feel we have drowned our money...
But I wanted to give a second try to see may be this time it wld be better ...but to my disappointment the detox shake which I ordered was also something that failed me to feel love for this place.
I was super excited to see d interior n d bottles n the tissue also.
I really wish if the taste of the drinks improve this place would be an amazing place to unwind",3,"2019-04-26 22:40:47",43,42,1
