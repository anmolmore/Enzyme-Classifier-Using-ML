"48510321","Loved all the flavours of indulge!!‚ù§Ô∏è My personal favourite is African dark chocolate with smoked almonds and vegan almond milk. Tried muskmelon, mango with chilli, rich almond butter, jack fruit, jamun. They were rich in quality. Worth the price. ",4,"2018-07-13 21:22:36",44,138,1
"4743521","The ice cream scene in Hyderabad has been a budding one and there are these little gems to discover. Its pure indulgence in here. You are set to lose your¬†heart out here. One is sure to miss this place and I have asked the management to place a decent board about the place. They have a decent spread of flavours, each unique in its own way. The Jamun flavour really piqued my interest at trying other flavours. After around tasting a half dozen settled for the tropical and the muffin one. Both were an instant hit. The flavour, the texture, the visual delight, everything fell into place. It couldn't have gotten any better than this. And I can say this with surety, there are none outlets in Gachibowli to even put up a decent fight to Indulge.
Best part: You get to take away the cups you are served in.

"940650","Indulge an ice cream joint of Hyderabad's iconic sweets-maker Almond House who has been in the sweets and savories business for a long time. I always wanted to try there ice creams and gelatos for a very long time. Their Unique flavors and combinations they regale ice creams in a cute little porcelain cups and this makes them a distinctive joint from other joints in the city. All the ice creams, gelatos and sorbets are freshly churned with natural ingredients right in front of our eyes and the best part about them is there low-fat and low-calorie portions. We can also customize and mix multiple flavors in a single cup for no extra cost. Not just that but Indulge is one of the very few joints which serves vegan ice creams like Kala Jamun, chocolate, muskmelon etc depending on seasonality. I tasted almost all the flavors available at the joint but I must say the true standout flavors were Mango chili, Tropical fruit, Bellam Kaju and Delli Kulfi. The sweetness level just exemplary, unlike the traditional ice creams which I feel, are a way to sweet. The Sorbets and Popsicles served are tangy and loaded with the goodness of fruits and are a must try for all fruit lovers. A special mention to Mango Chilly which was an absolute standout due to its initial sweetness and a spicy aftertaste makes this my pick among all the flavors offered by Indulge Icecream. All peeps bored with traditional ice cream flavors head to Indulge for an unconventional experience

"31169248","I was here with my friends after seeing pictures of mouth watering and colorful indulge ice creams on social media. After tasting almost all the flavors available, unable to decide what to eat as i found all the flavors very yummy, i decided to go with the vegan strawberry + tropical. The berry taste with the sweet taste of tropical flavor made the best combo. My friends took a dark chocolate with almonds and rich almond butter ice cream and they weren't disappointed either.
The staff was cordial.We had the ice creams in cute little cups and the staff was sweet enough to clean it for us and we were asked to take the cups home. :)
It would be awesome to have a branch of indulge in himayatnagar as well :D",4,"2018-04-30 19:11:12",8,5,0

"39445763","The taste was okay and overall above average. We tried the cookies and cream flavour and rich cocoa. 
I wouldn't say it's a must try and it's just a try in case you bump into it. 
One thing to note here is the cup which they serve the ice cream in. It's quite a different concept and moreover its takeaway üòÅüòâ",3,"2018-04-24 12:05:22",67,144,5

Tried Kala Jamun and Strawberries with Grape, amazing combination there. Their African Dark Chocolate with almonds and Rich Cocoa Chocolate flavours are a classic altogether.
Good job guys. :)",5,"2018-04-05 12:23:16",52,343,3
"29120078","Recently opened store adjoining Ratandeep super market in Indra nagar. The place is small and don't have space for standing or seating but doesn't matter when it comes for ice cream and their unique varieties... they are serving many different flavours than the usual ones..the staff is polite and jovial and explains about each flavour. We ordered kala jamun, grape +strawberry, mango chilly, chocolate and tropical fruits... kala jamun was the best as they don't mix milk in it so u can taste the jamun fruit at its best... mango chilly is the blast in mouth with mango taste first and u can feel the heat of chilly in throat but must try one. Grape + strawberry and chocolate was good too... they are serving in cone and cup ( u can take that cute cup home ) ..",4,"2018-04-01 11:49:31",18,35,4
"5363841","One of the hidden gems in Hyderabad. Their range of flavours are just amazing. It's all churned from fresh ingredients and frozen and is delicious. 
I ordered for a Brazilian hazelnut chocolate ice cream which was just perfect.for me. 
Also they serve you in small glass cups from their shop and you can take them.home üòÑ",4,"2018-03-27 11:54:21",213,1114,5

"32159204","The only difficulty we faced was finding this tiny place. It was a one-way ticket to Wonderland after that point. By far the best ice-creams we've had here. Tiny, cute place with adorable cups (one gets to take them home) that contain dollops of heavenly bliss. (Ahhh! They were that good)
A huge shout-out to Mr. Shahbaz for giving us a memorable dining experience. Very enthusiastic, patient and helpful staff who explained what the ingredients of each ice-cream was. They have some really innovative flavours. We tried a combination of Tiramisu and African Dark Chocolate with roasted almonds in one cute cup and Tropical in the other. We topped this dessert off with a bowl of Rasmalai. Couldn't walk in a straight line after.

"43730228","We happen to see this place while doing our groccery shopping  in Ratnadeep today. It is scooped inside Ratnadeep.This is the part of Almond house and I was very impressed by seeing the interesting flavors mentioned in their menu card.
They do not have any proper sit out area but they will arrange stools if someone wants to sit and enjoy the ice cream.
The attendant was very helpful. He gave me samples of almost all the flavors and I was nonplussed which one to choose from the list. The most striking ones I felt  were Jamun, fresh mango with chili, tropical, bellam kaju, dark african choclate with smoked almond.
I ordered one scoop with the fusion of ""mango with chilli""and ""tropical"" flavor.  The presentation was fabulous as the cushiony cream ball was placed in a tea cup with the tiny steel spoon. The tea cup and the spoon were souvenirs from Indulgence. 
As the ice cream hugs your tongue you will get the rich mango flavor and it will have a tingling effect to your throat because of added chillies. The ""tropical"" flavor has loads of fruity flavor.Price - Rs. 130 for one scoop ( inclusive of taxes)
Conclusion - Its a must try out place.",5,"2018-02-04 21:02:56",20,54,2
"38886625","Indulge has opened a store adjoining Ratnadeep Superstore. It is just a tiny outlet so do not expect any seating area.
They had a nice variety of interesting flavours. The staff is polite and they wait patiently as you try out different flavours before deciding your order.
We had Hazelnut with Caramelized Banana that was really good. The banana flavour stood out distinctly and tasted yummy.
You will have to opt either for a cone or cup( You get to take the cup home). I chose the cup because it seemed like a really cute souvenir.
The price was ‚Çπ130 which was a fair deal considering the huge quantity and amazing quality :)

"1725437","Reducing the ratung because of the place they have choosen for the shop as there is no place to sit or stand but staff is really polite and jovial.
Coming to the ice cream, if u really want to try something different and unique this is the place to have it. We tried kala jamun, dark chocolate and bellam kaju.
Kala jamun was a completely different type of ice cream as it was not having any milk added to it and it was straight taste of kala jamun. If u like kala jamun fruit the definitely go for this one.
One thing I didn't like was the taste of waffer in which ice cream was provided I feel there is lot of scope to improve in case of waffers.",3.5,"2018-01-27 00:18:37",99,414,0
"30996182","This place was an absolutely pleasant discovery when I ran into this outlet during a midnight stop at ratnadeep in gachibowli. In the same ratnadeep componmund, this place has it separate entrance but can be easy to miss if you don't look out for the ratnadeep landmark. They have this lovely pet idea of serving their ice creams in take away mini cups which double up as the perfect chai or black coffee cups at home. The Ice cream is organic and rich and the flavours are fairly pronounced. Love their ice cream. Definitely one of the favourites in town. ",4.5,"2018-01-18 14:52:04",70,92,0

"29116971","A Chennai-ites review :) 
This is a VERY small outlet (best to have takeaway or have it outdoor in the pleasant Hyderabad evening climate) that delivers pakka Ice cream.
Just like B&R, we can taste the ice cream before choosing, This SHOULD be encouraged in ALL ice cream shops where ice cream is directly served out of the box without mixing any more ingredients.
The service person boasted of all the ice cream having natural ingredients. Before choosing, I tasted South Indian Filter Coffee which was OK. Just as I was about to taste Dark chocolate, he insisted I taste Chilli Mango flavour. It was SOOOO good. I then tasted and was about to pick Dark chocolate, when he surprised me with a good news, that I can combine 2 flavours for the same price (‚Çπ130) :D
Needless to say, I picked both :) Coming to the review.
Fresh Mango with Chilli: We all must've had Maangai with Podi (Raw Mango with Chilli Powder). Well this ice cream is filled with the sweet, fruity, pulpy flavour of ripened Mango with the after-taste of spicy Chilli. The ice cream tasted perfect with each spoon. LOVED it to the core. This flavour is a MUST-TRY if you visit Indulge Ice Cream :)
African Dark Chocolate with Smoked Almonds: I know that the name sounds good. I'll guarantee that it tastes just as impressive. :) The Dark Chocolate was combined with a sort of Smokey flavour, which made it VERY unique. That too when you get a crunchy almond in your spoon, it is just bliss :) On the whole, Worth-u üëå
I loved that they served it with a SMALL spoon, allowing me to INDULGE in the ice cream (Pun intended) rather than just gobble it up. They also let me keep the porcelain cup after washing it :)
Verdict: A must-visit if you stay within the vicinity of any of its branches",5,"2017-11-18 20:19:07",74,191,6
"5377501","Bored of the stone ice creams.. indulge have become my go to place. This outlet of indulge is inside the ratnadeep super market making it a bit difficult to site it.. 
After a dinner at a near by restaurant we we're here to satisfy our sweet tooth. 
Of the natural fruit flavours I liked the seasonal sitafal and kala jamun. Kalajamun is for for some one who savours the fruit.. 
Vegan strawberry smootie will keep the strawberry lovers wanting for more.  
Dilwale kesar kulfi and pistachio we're good as well. 
Tried the African dark chocolate with smoked almonds.. this one was a flavour I had never tried before. Loved the taste of dark chocolate and an after taste of almonds to soothe the taste buds.. 
And finally a visit to indulge can never be complete for me without my fav mango thick shake.. the thick shake has been consistent for me ryt from the time they have started..",4,"2017-11-14 16:04:21",352,2073,4
"132958","This would've been my favourite Ice Cream if it were not for their 'fusion' flavours - like one, hate the other! 
Chilli - Yay, Mango - Nay
Forest Berry - Yay, Cumin - Nay
Ginger - Yay, Lemon - Nay
Thankfully they have other unique flavours which are delectable - Tropical, African Dark Chocolate & Tiramisu being my pick of the lot. The adventurous types may like the South Indian Filter Kaapi & Fig and Honey variants
Being freshly churned & with lesser fat content than regular ice creams, they seem a tad different on the palate and might not be as airy & fluffy as we'd like but that's their USP
Pricing is definitely on the higher side, ‚Çπ120 for a single serving but you get to keep the ceramic cup. The family pack is given in a bigger ceramic pot but quantity-wise it might feel less VFM at ‚Çπ500 bucks. ",3,"2017-10-29 17:51:14",166,459,0

"2398098","Fresh and delicious ice cream. I ate the almond creme and the kala jamun flavors for ‚Çπ130/- each, both were really good and refreshing. But I think that it is overpriced.

"31906531","Its a small outlet inside Almond house. They have a huge variety of flavors. We got the ice-cream packed once and their packing is really cute.
We tried:
African Dark Chocolates with smoked Almonds: Almonds and chocolate is indeed a great combination. The quantity of almonds is good in proportion to amount of gelato. And the taste and thickness of gelato is great too.
Rich cocoa: Its another good chocolate flavor. But I prefer dark chocolate one more, based on taste.
Tried a spoon of these for testing:
Fresh mango with chilli: It sure is a very unique flavor. At first you get the taste of mango, and after indulging you get a taste of chilli.
Rasgulla: This is another unique tasting flavor.
South Indian filter kaapi: Best option for coffee lovers. Its like having a cold form of filter coffee.
Vanilla bean: I am a vanilla hater. But I actually loved it. The shopkeeper told me that they made it from beans from kerala. ",4.5,"2017-09-28 19:48:44",175,571,5
