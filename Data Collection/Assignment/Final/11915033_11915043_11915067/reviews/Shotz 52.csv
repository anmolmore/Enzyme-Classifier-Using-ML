"213321","I’m surprised I’ve walked past this place so many times and not tried a thing. Perfectly tucked at the entry point of Cusino, this is a good find. 
The then icecream joint, is now a healthy place picking up the fitness trend. Smoothies, smoothie bowls, chia puddings and overnight oats. Name your Pinterest-y fad and it is served here. 
Quite an ambitious venture, though I’m surprised it’s frequently empty.
So what do they serve? 
Smoothies- The list is extensive 
Smoothie bowls- quite filling 
Chia puddings- perfect for the dessert mood 
Overnight oats- You might want to preorder. 
So, I am hooked to smoothie bowls and have been eating plenty around the globe. This tiny place near Deloitte is perfect for those. 
What did I eat?
Triple berry oat smoothie:
I was here for a quick lunch and chose to go for the safest that’s on their display. Smooth, at a pleasant temperature and well presented. 
While a lot of things were on point, some need a little more focus. It could have been bigger on the fruit front and the helping could have been better. However, for  the price you pay, you can’t complain. 
The quality and hygiene certainly gets full marks here. Quite an impressive place. Certainly coming back for more. 
If you’re around, don’t miss out, go try, you won’t regret!! 
Also, extremely polite staff. Radhe is great with conversations and happy to customise. Do chat. ",3,"2018-12-06 16:10:16",96,1068,3
