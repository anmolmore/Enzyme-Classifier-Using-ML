"35836801","It's hard to get sweet shop that actually delivers sweets of small quantity via zomato and swiggy. I managed to find them on swiggy and ordered Lavu boondi laddu on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi. It was good. Will order from there again ",4,"2018-09-29 18:05:07",247,316,0
"1549883","I had bad experiences with sweet magic 3 times in this month. Pastries were so hard and didn't look fresh everytime I buy there so I avoided pastries from them. 2 time I faced issue with kaala jamun which was like bitter in taste and asked my mom to return the same tomorrow. Only best thing I like there is ulavacharu.
Management i have already complained to the billing counter guys about the pastries. Not sure if it has reached u. Please consider and take some action on the sweet magic Rai durgam",1,"2018-08-18 22:48:02",7,24,0
"30454905","Been here with family for dinner.  
Comfort and hygiene :
Ac was not working properly and can literally see mosquitoes on onion plates.  
Food : 
We had rotis along with malai mushroom which was excellent. 
Methi malai was a disaster. We had to send it back for corrections.  It was tasteless. 
Paneer butter masala was avg.  
chicken pulao was pathetic.  
Overall. It‚Äôs not a very bad experience ",1,"2018-07-28 00:14:13",53,107,0
"51529263","Worst food quality and service. Guys who take orders will put aside our own choice of food and suggest the food which is left in the kitchen as chefs special and sell of the food. Egg served in biryani is in black colour and when asked they have said that they have baked the biryani in oven but biryani is cold and when asked they have no answer. Worst experience when went with family",1,"2018-07-12 21:42:52",3,12,0
"43637214","This place is located on the Tolichowki road and I went there twice to get sweets, ice creams and also tried their Egg Dosa [Rs.84 with taxes] which I felt was a bit dry and did not go well with their chutneys.
Other than their Egg dosa which was not so great I liked all the sweets I tried here;¬† Ras Malai [Rs.35 per piece], Malai Chum Chum [Rs.35 per piece] and Carrot cake [Rs.40 per pack]. My favorite item was their Badam Milk which came in a small bottle but was super delicious.
After their sweets I also tried many of their Ice creams out of which I would definitely recommend¬† Chikoo and Mango ice cream. Both the flavors were rich, creamy and felt like eating real fruits.epicureantales.com",3,"2018-06-27 23:19:01",443,2462,9
"54181570","This is a sweet shop, hotel, restaurant and banquet hall combined well into a place. A famous restaurant from Vijaywada, Ulvacharu biryani is their speciality. The food is good, but a bit expensive, especially the dessert options which are limited and very expensive. The ulvacharu biryanis (non veg as well as veg) are a must try.",4,"2018-06-20 00:34:56",57,42,1
"34468683","Visited this restaurant as it's on the main road and was very hungry to travel further. Interiors are good, I liked the black and white pics of old movies and expected the food to be good but very disappointed with the taste and service. Ordered Manchurian and asked the waiter to bring veg biryani after some time which he forgot. None were nearby when we wanted to enquire and then he came and asked for the next order. Had to wait with empty plates only to taste food that was as bad as service.",1,"2018-06-07 15:54:38",36,15,0
"29595357","Been here thrice, today with my mother-in-law in tow as we wanted her to have a good south Indian meal. Turned out to be quite the opposite. One word would best describe the experience - irresponsible, both in service and delivery. The quality of food served was of no class - not fresh - AT ALL. It seemed that the chef had other pressing issues to attend to than to hand out a fresh, well cooked meal. The quality of flavored rice served with Thali was such that it was left to dry without a lid for hours - it wasn't much different than uncooked rice. The dessert was dry as well. I can only comment about vegetarian options..not so much about their non veg variety. However, there was a company of 12-14 people who were at the restaurant at the same time and we heard them complain about multiple things for most of the time we were present. It seems we weren't the only ones to have had such a disappointing experience. The service is quite slow, as noticed on our earlier 2 visits too, there is never a person around when you need something, nevertheless there are a lot of people seen ambling about, but none who would help out when called, which leads to a lot of wait time. We expected much better quality as they quite proudly advertised about serving authentic telugu food. I am sorry to say that our average, daily home made food is 100% better than what has been served here.",1.5,"2018-05-20 16:28:14",9,47,0

"1904466","Update:
Went for team lunch yesterday. Ordered spl chicken Biryani. They have given biryani rice separately (frankly it is not even biryani rice, just tasted like jeera rice) and chicken curry separately. I totally failed to understand how biryani will have chicken curry..... Reduced my rating 
Been there to this restaurant couple of times. Tasted paneer 65 which i say is awesome. Paneer is so soft which i haven't tasted in any other restaurant till now. Tasted chicken biryani which is also good. biryani rice is not so spicy and lids can also enjoy it.",2,"2018-01-11 12:06:05",156,726,10

"2669020","They are just looting people in the name of sweets. Management should think about competition and learn how to sell things. Apparently overcharging customers won't give you proper business.

"27871576","Its a Vijayvada sweet shop chain that has opened its chain in Hyderabad too. I just had a chance to have the famous Mysore Pak from here and out of surprise it tasted delicious. It was neither too soft nor too much of ghee. It was appropriate in taste, somewhat different kind of mysore pak in cmparison to the authentic desi ghee one. It was so mushy and had a smooth texture that It just melted in mouth. Must try!",3.5,"2017-07-12 23:35:10",112,334,0

Haven't seen their setup yet to comment on the ambience and service details. But definitely a good option for trying out some tasty biryanis.
Tried their sweets today. Reasonable prices and tasty. Well worth than the so called premium priced famous sweet shops in the town.",4,"2017-05-13 20:43:54",126,1136,2
"39778925","Its a really awesome food what sweet magic serves on plate. I had least expectation from this resturant when i thought to visit as Just entered this place to experiment and what, that turned to be successful experiment. Nice ambience.....with old telugu melodies, coming to food: we order chicken clear soup, schezwan fish and egg noddles. The soup was good, noddles were well cooked in low oil and very tasty we didn't even ordered any wet dish and could able to eat without any wet dish. Coming to Fish, this is awesome, mind blowing......any word i will use to describe the taste of this dish will be not able to justfy its taste and like heaven, every peice i take in my mouth got melted like an ice cream, awesome taste all my taste buds felt like heaven after long time. The best thing about this resturant is its very pocket friendly, awesome quality and taste, with a really good quantity.....i reccomend this resturant more than 5 stars.

"2974916","Paid second visit yesterday for dinner,  having tried the buffet lunch with team few months back which left me impressed. This time we ordered Angara Murg Tikka for starter and Avakaya Chicken Biryani for main course. The order took quite long to appear on the table but the taste more than made up for it. 
Murg tikka had very strong flavors,  tender and spicy with holy smoky flavor of the tandoor in a semi gravy texture and served in good portions. Avakaya Chicken Biryani again had the same traits,  strong and unapologetic flavors in your face (or rather mouth)  deriving quite a lot from the pickles mixed in the rice.  Quantity was sufficient for two persons with handsome appetite which was satiated with the customary buttermilk towards the end. 
This place has big blowups of yesteryear movie icons adorning the walls and very old tunes playing with dim lighting to set up the mood.  Worth a try,  though priced a bit steep (750+ for a starter,  Biryani and supporting drinks). Recommended! ",4,"2016-09-21 21:01:05",161,199,0
"29814356","WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. So I got fooled by the good reviews around. The 1st time we ordered stir fried mushroom starter and it was bland and boiled. Not stirred ! These guys don't even know the difference between stir fry and boiling. Moreover, it's not at all tasty felt like vomiting and VERY VERY LESS QUANTITIES. 
And as I'm writing this review, I'm throwing SALTY prawns garlic which I just got home delivered from these guys. I will NOT give these guys a 3rd chance. Two times, horrible experience. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. Not worth it. An honest review.",1,"2016-08-17 22:05:27",38,50,0

The ambiance is good. Entrance is a sweet shop seeing which we felt did we land at the wrong place, but they slowly guided us through.
The food was very good. They specialise in Ulavacharu Biryani, which was really good. The veg special biryani was also really good.
The starters were decent. Soup was the only one which wasn't so good.
Service was a bit slow too.
