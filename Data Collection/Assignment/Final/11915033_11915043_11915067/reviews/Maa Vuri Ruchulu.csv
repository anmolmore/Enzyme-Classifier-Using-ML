"69194777","My experience with this restaurant is not good.
I have ordered veg combo online.I thought it would be some gravy n roti but it was curd rice and sambar rice after seeing that i was disappointed.
At least they should give description about their combo",2,"2019-01-16 14:36:50",19,10,0

"2571704","Avakaya mudda pappu annam : This is the favorite meal of middle class andhra folks. And they have managed to craft the same taste into this too. The rice is piping hot, with succulent raw mango pieces, all mixed in a dal which is prepared to perfection
Oh what a meal ! 10/10",5,"2018-10-06 22:15:30",124,370,3
