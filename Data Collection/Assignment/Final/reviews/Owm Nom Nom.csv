"31123982","This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.....!!
The worst ever experience which I have ever faced.....
Zero taste, zero service, NO ac nor fan, the staff has no basic respect nor they are worried about the customer.
The food served was rotten & no proper hygiene was maintained.
The Restaurant manager Mr. Anwar was rude towards customers don't know why they are running this hotel.
Completely ZERO.",1,"2019-05-03 14:20:13",9,242,0

"36686510","We had a worst experience, waste of money no courtesy, pathetic quality of food. They serve cuddle milk soup instead of cream of mushroom. Server argue and justify you place wrong order. Old fish, cheap oil they use. We paid our bill and had to left food without eating. Never to visit this place again ",1,"2019-04-17 01:07:36",4,1,0

"14541441","The waiters are super slow, the cutlery used in the restaurant are not even clean. Hygiene is a big issue here. Coming to the food, it's nothing extraordinary except the fact that the taste is close to home made food. But again, the usage of oil is much more. Biryani and tandoori are the safest options here. Keep a track of what you are ordering because the bill might not come right. Check it before paying. I found a dish added in the bill which I did not order. When pointed out, the waiter seemed to be confused.
This place, if it has a target of surviving,needs to improve a lot in terms of food taste, consistency, service and most importantly, hygiene.",2,"2019-03-31 13:06:33",685,792,0
"36839345","I have been there 2to 3 times but this time i had the worst experience. Waiter was in some othe worls we asked him to bring something and he ordered something..
At the time of serving food the waiter told us paneer is there but paneer tikka is not available and the hilarious part was we did not order paneer tikka, so what we ordered in veg in that also it did not had paneer. At the time of billing they create a lot of chaos...

"43573341","Place located just opposite of DLF gate no 3, which is very much easy to reach. Just reached this place to explore some of their expertise dishes and found lost !
Food quality and staff slowness made me horrible.
Seems they have done some renovation recently, which give something new and good feeling. But to be honest, in a restaurant people visit for good food followed by service. And if this is not maintained then there is no meaning ..!
All the best guys and please do some deep thinking and improve the food quality and service part.",1,"2019-03-05 12:26:52",71,2079,0

"41112093","Ordered chicken lollipop as a starter..but received them as burnt,salty and wet instead of dry snack. Egg fried rice was ok. Chicken kadai curry was not tasty at all .Chicken seems to be old stock. Veg rolls looked like Dosa roll instead. Rolls should be crispy with stuff not coming out. Didn't like the food at all .

Food-4/5 Main course at this place is very good. Biryani is not out of this world but tastes good.
Ambience- (3.5/4)
The restaurant as a whole has gone renovation and it's upgraded to become ""ok"" type ambience
Service-2/5
Very slow, staff are super rude and they don't give a damn about anything.
