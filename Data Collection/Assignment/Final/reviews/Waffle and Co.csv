"607059","Food is good. Loved waffles. Tried all 4 types of waffles. They will give on sticks. Churros are awesome. I used to buy churros from churrolto. Better than churrolto. I can say that. 
No seating is there. Take away or ordering from Zomato is good option. ",4,"2019-04-04 15:56:25",18,18,0
"217608","Ordered red velvet churros. Really stiff and chewy. Also kind of stinky. Aren't they supposed to be soft on the inside crispy on the outside? Really bad experience. ",1,"2019-03-27 17:36:17",7,2,0
"2036154","So I was watching¬†this place getting ready from scratch as my office is right beside it and was waiting to taste what they got. Finally, I have paid a visit for their waffle stick and coffee. It's a small cute place with bare seating available (max 10) with simple nice ambience. Ordered Choco berries from stick waffle. Just that its pleasing to eyes but nothin great over the waffles. I expected a crispy bite but it isn't.¬† Even the coffee wasn't up to the expectation for the quantity to pricing and more than half was the coffee froth for cappuccino.¬† Maybe will give it another try and then alter the rating if I find it improved.

"30517653","Waffle Sticks are a MUST TRY!!! I've been there a few times and loved them each time. They've also got some games like UNO and Jenga for you to pass your time while you wait for the yummy waffles. A big plus from me!
Looking forward to try Churros and the others in their long list of desserts. üòÑ",5,"2018-12-25 18:40:15",10,51,1
"6350361","Small and nice place. They have stick waffles, mocktails and deserts. I only tried waffles which were ok. Waffle were quite soft. I was expecting them to be crunchy. ",3,"2018-12-13 00:21:39",49,48,2
"1202564","Meh! Just ok. There can be a serious rise in the service and the time they take to serve. I also felt the taste of the waffle is complimented with it's add ons. The Waffle here must have been ok but the add-ons took a large portion of itself to lose the taste of the waffle itself. I feel the balance isn't there. Either it's too much of sugar rush or there is just the waffle.",3,"2018-12-04 13:38:37",54,68,0
"52706923","I have tasted classic waffle stick here few months back in a food fest and I had a craving for that from many months.. Since I didnt notice the stall name.. I missed it all these days. Suddenly out of no where I saw this item again, Thanks Zomato..
No doubt.. My fav food till date is from Waffle and co. Recommended items: Churros and sticks.
Note: This store is near Ramky towers, not near sln terminus(wrongly pointed in maps)",5,"2018-11-26 22:21:50",10,3,0
"31906531","Was thinking for ordering from here for a long time. Finally, ordered.
Classic Churros with dark Chocolate sauce: Churros were really tasty, made to perfection. Quantity of sauce was perfect.
PS. Their packaging is really pretty. ",5,"2018-11-25 02:57:00",175,571,3

"15102371","I ordered Nutella crunchy waffle from this place few days back. Delivery was done on time by the guy. Packing was good.
Coming to waffle, it was like prepared long back and had been delivered, didn't find it fresh because of which excess sugar can be felt on the palate. As per the quantity and putting some code it was ok to deliver but the original price is not justified by the taste. ",2,"2018-10-31 01:47:32",362,4095,1
"76272252","Amazing desserts I would always prefer waffle and co and I also just found out that they sell cakes. I‚Äôve never had waffle sticks before and I was told that this is the only place in Telangana that sells waffle sticks",5,"2018-10-21 20:43:45",1,0,2

"56495822","Conveniently located¬† just opposite the Meenakshi Towers it is a small parlor. Has a very comfortable look and feel.Coming to the menue it has waffles,cakes and beverages.
Waffles are not that great and the options too are very limited.We tried Nutella and chocolate waffle.It was nothing extraordinary.
The second in menu are the cakes.I tried the red velvet jar cake it was average in taste.
The beverages are okaish.¬†
Besides the wait time is too much don't know why as the there is hardly any crowd and neither does the food taste fresh..
So you can easily give this place a miss!!!",2,"2018-10-10 20:29:47",8,9,0
"6624401","The space was cramped but the hospitality wasn't. Tried the co. but not the waffles. 
Cake in a jar wasn't just an eye catching thing - it charmed the tongue too. 
If sugar upsets you, then try the churros - where the gentle spice of cinnamon balances the sugariness.Cool place.",3,"2018-09-30 17:59:26",52,93,0

"1899484","Waffle and co visited my college campus-IMT HYDERABAD as a part of an event and the presence of waffle and co was remarkable.
I would like to talk about waffle and co highlighting certain things which I loved.
The presentation- waffle and co‚Äôs dessert presentation was beautiful and very catchy which made me buy more waffles and brownies.
The staff- staff was very humble,they helped me choose the best stuff they had and that was proven to be very helpful.
Taste- Nutella crunch and fudge all the way was too good and that made me fall in love with waffles with stick.
Overall a great experience and a complete value for money.",5,"2018-09-27 16:59:08",108,677,4

"35725514","I was planning to go to this cute little place since quite a few days. Being in the vicinity of corporate offices, this is the place to be if you are looking for a change.
From the outside, this looks like one of those high end cafes of London where you'd wish to go.
Located next to the Old Madras Baking Company, this place serves concept waffles and desserts. They do not have any traditional waffles. They have stick waffles in a few flavours and some desserts and mocktails.
The seating area is very limited. You cannot sit here for long. It's perfect to just hog on to your waffle and leave though they do have UNO if you wanna sit for long and pass your time.
I ordered Chocolate Stick Waffles topped with Strawberry which was a delight for my taste buds. I had never tasted stick waffles before and these tasted real good. Perfectly crisp and savoury.
Also, this place is not very heavy on the pocket.
This cute lil place is definitely worth a try!",3,"2018-09-22 14:01:12",87,770,0
"2014662","Just happened to enter this place while going to Old Madras Baking Company. Since this place was fairly new and hiding amidst other under construction places we hadn‚Äôt noticed this one. 
Ambience: Still needs a lot of work. But they have ample of space outside and you can grab a seat
Food: Churros were really good! 
Service: Amiable staff! ",4,"2018-09-01 01:14:51",5,5,2
