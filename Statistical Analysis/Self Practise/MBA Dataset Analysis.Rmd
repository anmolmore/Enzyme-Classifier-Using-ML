This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data <- read.csv("../Datasets/mba.csv")
```

773 rows, with gmat scores from 600-780

```{r}
summary(data)
```

```{r}
d <- density(data$gmat)
plot(d)
#hist(data$gmat)
```

```{r}
boxplot(data$gmat)
```
```{r}
plot(qnorm(seq(0.01,0.99,0.01)))

```

```{r}
x <- c(0.49, 0.59, 0.86, 1.01, 1.24, 1.25, 1.81, 2.01, 2.29, 2.66, 2.82, 2.85, 3, 3.27, 4.44, 5.14, 5.53, 5.6, 6.06, 6.29)
mean(x)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
