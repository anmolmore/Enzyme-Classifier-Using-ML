Service is swift, food middling and seating basic.
You may give it a try if you are around - doesn't warrant any weekend voyages from far.",3,"2018-10-23 21:18:38",52,93,0
"35260467","Amazing food, people used to come here when they get bored with their hostel food and want some north indian taste, this restaurants provides a pure punjab taste and believe me , it's worth it. The cost of food is cheaper as compared to other nearby restaurants. So if you are planning to skip your home food, you should probably land up here only.",5,"2018-10-14 14:04:18",14,30,3
