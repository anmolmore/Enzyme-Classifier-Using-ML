"607723","Very laid back staff. We ordered chilli toast and got the order served after half an hour. Just to toast a piece of bread they took 30 minutes literally. I had to follow up twice or thrice. The cocktail wasn‚Äôt better either. It tasted just like water with a hint of vodka. And I had to ask for sauces to go with the fish I ordered. No side fresh salads or sauces to go with the main. The fish tasted good, though it was slightly over cooked. They can improve their service levels to a great extent. And also their food. It somehow gave me a feeling that they didn‚Äôt bother about the customers. ",2,"2019-04-08 08:32:04",38,114,0

"12319761","Had a terrible exp on Saturday  night (22nd Sep). I have been quite regular To komotos on Friday eve woh my office colleagues and had good exp so far. Tonight I recommended this place to my friend for dine out. 
When my friend arrived the staff at the kitchen told there is no ala-carte tonight. Only option is buffet. So they started with buffet. When I reached it a little surprise to me and I checked with the manager there Mr. Abhiveer. He also denied about the ala-carte. So we continued with buffet later while walking around the buffet spread we learnt that ala-Carte is also there and three ppl lied to us. As I am a big fan of their Hamas and pita dish I asked for the menu and Mr. Abhiveer is sayin we don‚Äôt have menu, please check the menu in Zomato. What? Who the hell ll publish the menu only on zomato in a restaurant and are the customers fool enough? 
Buffet food options for vegetarians are very less. Their dessert spread was good though. 
Their service was also pathetic for the indian bread and other stuff. After asking numerous time for spoons and tissues, this is how the tissues were served to us on the table (plz refer the pic). We had 3 kids with us, imagine how long these tissues would have been their in this manner! üòÄ
BIG NO TO PPL if you want to have just one or two dishes there. We got trapped today.",1,"2018-09-23 00:10:02",3,2,0
"873012","This place is love. It's your everyday bar.
This place not just welcomes regular customers but make the leave a mark, literally. You'll find name plates of it's regular customers all over the bar. And their bartenders absolutely know how to keep the customers happy. This is one place where you will find more people sitting at the bar, rather than the regular seating arrangement it has.
Sonu being their star bartender, you'll find almost everyone calling him out for their drinks and he absolutely takes care of all his regulars with a smile. We usually order a whiskey sour and sangria, being our absolute favorite. Accompanied by crispy corn and their signature pizza, which is baked fresh out of their Jonathan's kitchen.
If you're a party animal you'll find this place a hit on Thursdays where they take their ladies night very seriously. All drinks on the house.
I'd absolutely recommend this place, if you're looking for your next regular bar.

Went there after attending a comedy gig and this place continued the fun.
The band ""Aatish Official"" were rocking that day. Never heard the better band then them in any pub in Hyderabad. I dont have words to praise them enough.
Coming to the food , it was delicious and the quantity were sufficient.
Staff was good and took care of us well even though the place was crowded.
The only thing to be improved is that the Manager n bouncers should be able to handle the drunk persons better. There was a group of people celebrating a birthday but they were all over the place. They were disturbing the band and also other people just couldn't get on dance floor. Thats the only thing due to which I am not giving this place a 5.

"15825287","Been here on a weekend with friends as this is attached to JK , Ordered a Red bull , Grilled Murrel With Herb Rice and Dragon Prawns FYI- I am a seafood lover . Coming to the review of each - Murrel was grilled to perfection , the way I like it with some veggies , Murrel is my favorite fish and it needs to be cooked perfectly to enjoy its taste and it was made too good , this was served with rice and some veggies , Coming to Dragon Prawns again perfectly cooked and made to perfection . Komatose as a place is good to hang out with friends and enjoy after a tiring day / weekend the staff here is friendly and moreover the managers are welcoming and helps you out on your selection according to your mood / taste .",5,"2018-06-19 05:52:12",28,266,3
"33536593","Komatose on a Sunday night is the perfect place to be, happened to be drizzling, which made for the perfect atmosphere to chill outside in the cabanas.
Inside was a pretty small area for a bar, but had loads of seating space which extended out to a floor above, overlooking the area below. Lighting was funky and great, the vibrant colors adding to the vibe. üíì
Being a big bunch, we ordered different drinks and luckily I got to taste all. The most special of these were from 'the 7 deadly sins of Koma' menu. The taste was as described on the menu. Lust in particular was something different I'd never tasted before, a chilli-spiced vodka, strawberry infusionüå∂Ô∏èüç∏.
The appetizers we had we're really good, something I enjoyed more than the alcohol.
Dragon prawnsüç§, Grilled pomfretüêü, Peshawar Chapali Kebabs are some of the must orders! Didn't quite like the Nawabi Shikhampuri. While all the items tasted great, I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price.
Best for the last, not being a kid here, but the mocktails were just mind-blowing. Had a few different fruit flavors, peach, mango, green apple, lime, out of which the peach was the best. Multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush üçπ.
The service was professional and quick. Would've wished for better music, and there was no DJ at the music station. However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great! It's a perfect place to watch a match screening, have a party, or if you're in the mood for it, go into 'Comatose' üòâ.
Here's my overall SCORE:
Food - 3.5/5
Ambience - 3.5/5 
VFM - 3.5/5
Service - 3.5/5",3.5,"2018-06-18 14:26:33",145,3376,12
"33768081","It's my 3rd visit to koma and this time I couldn't try much of their drinks but this is a place where you actually can party and and chill at the same time
sitting in cabanas just outside the door. If you're are party freak, you would like to be inside but who can deny to a live music and enjoying a lovely time with your gang.
The drinks I liked where Virgin Mojito, Lust and Gluttony. All of them were quite different from each other and tastes really well.
Special thanks to the guy who prepared all of these drinks.

"45807133","No option to give zero or less.. visited the place with friends during the happy hours..
Food and drinks: friends has opted for whiskey and myself has ordered for mocktail, requested for less sugar syrup , which was not honoured at all... Food portion was so less that a kid can gulp it at one go.. some of the items were reheated and served..
The biggest surprise came along with bill , they thought the group was drunk and no matching to the number of drinks ordered Vs Billed.. serious integrity issues.. we called them to correct which took good amount of time, least bothered to apologize or explain.. NO GO place..blocked the place.. ",1,"2018-06-12 20:16:31",1,1,0
"49480226","The management is naive and doesnt know how to keep the place happening. The happy hours timing goes for a toss as they have limited or better to say nothing at disposal during that time.

Tried Greed among the cocktails which had the base of whiterum , brandy along with lime and orange, one of the 7 deadly sins of KOMA.    Among  the mocktails had Blackcurrent , lime and peach and also green apple(prepared on request) which were cool enough to have. Among the starters we tried fish , chicken , prawn dishes. Overall a very nice experience .",5,"2018-06-08 20:06:15",27,294,15

"4532951","Few weeks back, after a tiring day out, we decided to spend the evening at Komatose. Choosing to sit outside, we got to know that they have Grill and Chill Saturdays. The live music for that night had been set outdoors. The weather being fairly pleasant, it was good to hear Atish dole out melodious numbers one after the another. Got a request? He would be more than willing to fit it in!
Coming to the food, after a long time I had a great Paav Bhaji. This was part of the live counters there. I hasked for some extra butter on paavs, to which the cook readily complied :D
Another live counter had paneer and veg rolls. Tried the paneer one, and liked it. For the mains, you have a lot of options to choose from. Do give the pizza a try.
The desserts are another wide spread. You find both desi and fancy desserts. I tried the blueberry cake, kiwi mousse, fruit cake, orange cake, brownie, burfi ‚Äî everything was so well done!
All in all, do visit the place on a Saturday, to have a gala time.

I had high expectations by seeing the rating but unfortunately the menu, place and the crowd was very dissapointing.
We like the fried Mozzarella... couldn't find anything better or unusual :/
Well this is not a separate restaurant, they use one single restaurant by two names.
ONLY WHAT MADE ME GIVE A 3 RATINGS was the LIVE MUSIC (bollywood beautiful voice of the singer)

"1349101","Well next to Jonathans Kitchen is this place to down a few.
Komatose is a good crowd puller, with plenty of weekend party groups and people from nearby IT companies.
The team at the bar does a phenomenon job. Their interaction with guests is over the top, no wonder I heard of people visiting this place almost every day of the year.
Also, from my experience, this is one of those few places where the Sound Acoustics are so well designed that its loud yet comfortable. You will not come out with a sore throat.
The food comes from its sibling Jonathans Kitchen, so we know it can never go wrong. About the drinks, well what could go wrong with them ! ) and Oh ! did I mention the Cheese Chilli Toast.. Its Different.. Try it..
The outdoor cabanas can seat about 8 ~ 10 people each, wonderful for the evenings.
Great Music with shows on specific days of the week.
Draft is served, but tends to vanish Quickly :)¬†
