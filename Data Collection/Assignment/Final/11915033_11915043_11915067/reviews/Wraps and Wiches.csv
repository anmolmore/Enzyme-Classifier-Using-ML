"27725380","The place is in dlf and one can go here for late night food.
I had w n w special wrap there which costs 100, the crap was good could have been for 75-80 rupees , generally people sell for more price because of the ambience, ac , service etc they provide but this place had nothing of that kind.
Place was ok average looking with no maintenance table , chairs were dirty, AC was just for name sake.
Don't really want to comment on service the one who was cooking was giving the wraps so was slow.

"39861574","I have ordered online a chicken egg burger and a chicken salad. The burger was with boiled egg chicken keema with cheese which was good where as the chicken salad was not up-to the mark as it was just chicken keema with few small pieces of carrot and cucumber and mayo.

Let me tell you I am a north Indian and this was first time ever I got a true taste of my place. The food was ultimate. Swaad of north. Great taste...",5,"2018-05-03 00:47:40",1,1,0

Truly at midnight their food was just awesome. Thank you Wraps and wiches

"48392096","so it was late night hunger that made me to order late in the night at 12. This restaurant is newly opened and don't had many reviews. But I still thought of giving it a try.
Ordered the bestseller Burger and a Paneer Chilli wrap with add on cheese. The packaging of the food was directly done into the aluminium foil with putting the wrap and burger in any box, which I find bit odd. 
The wrap was filled with lots of Paneer but didn't had that Taste which was expected from a wrap. Same was the case with burger, it was full of cheese but taste was absent. Not satisfied with the food.",1,"2018-05-02 01:20:19",33,772,0
