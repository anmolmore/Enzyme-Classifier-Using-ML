"55473088","Ordered thali combo from zomato. Taste is good but quantity of curries they gave is less. Roties are also good. Plastic boxes can be avoided in the packing for curries.",3,"2019-05-16 12:25:37",17,2,0
"200501","I was visiting Hyderabad. I fell ill(flu). I needed some homely food as i could not eat more biryani or paneer-naan. I went to Gujarati mess. The fulka thali (Combo2) for 3 days, and i felt much better. The price they take for food is near social service. Keep on the good work.",5,"2019-03-20 02:56:06",2,12,0

It was really good,healthy and sufficient food.
Just the taste was not the great.
Too much salt used in every curry.
Methi parantha is good here",3,"2019-01-15 16:13:34",7,9,0
"27921088","I have ordered methi paratha thali and was hoping for a nice homely authentic meal but sadly was very disappointed.
All the 2 curries and dal tasted only of curry leaves. It tasted no different from the andhra tiffin food. Only the methi paratha tasted well.
Please do not disappoint customer on the cuisine that you are offering. Try being little authentic.",1,"2019-01-04 21:24:28",95,299,1

"39736755","I ordered food via zomato. The restaurant had accepted the order. The food was suppose to be deliver by 12.55 Pm. Not getting the food till that time, i spoke with Zomato guys and they said restaurant cancelled the order and the same was not conveyed as they had a device issue. The restaurant could have called me directly and said they are cancelling the order. Poor service. Had to wait 30 mins for food ending up with no delivery!! Never going to order again.

"52703080","Actually 3.5 stars I want to give to them. Food was budget friendly, the taste was ok-ok (Don't expect GHAR KA SWAAD¬†as people are referring. Maybe at their place they get same taste but my mom can cook better).¬†
So if you are bored with biryani and Chinese or with your regular south Indian¬†food then go for it, it's good for as a taste changer.¬†
I liked the quantity they gave in ‚Çπ140, Daal¬† 2 curries, buttermilk some kachauri following with 5 methi paratha(Yeah, I can handle that much).
They delivered it fast and it's good because I don't see what would have taken time apart from paratha.
All over saying I didn't like the taste would be harsh but it's not like that I liked. But I was happy with the quantity. (Paratha were good in taste, curry and daal were like hostel food)",3,"2018-10-14 11:48:26",4,8,0

"15772890","This is a 2BHK flat converted into a restaurant. The place is very simple so much that you need to throw your own plates. The food like most reviews say is very simple and homely. Rotis are served hot which is great. However the variety is missing.Moreover the menu that you find here on Zomato isn't the same available in the restaurant. Just the name is Gujarati Mess and the items in the thali aren't. Maybe I expected a lot from this place. Further the owner isn't quite a jovial person and you cannot strike a conversation with him.

"35851057","Quick, tasty and nice.
Best value for money and great taste.¬† I was a bit doubtful in the beginning.¬† But was proven wrong (and in this context I enjoyed being wrong :-D )

This place has FOOD FOOD¬† and only Tasty & Healthy FOOD. Very Economic.
Me with my family is a regular visiter to this place.
People who like home like food with no Frills will love this place and its simple food. They serve nice hot & fresh food. I am in love with their Theplas.
It has clean, mess like ambience where you have to put your own used plates to the washing area.
One thing to Note is : It is not Gujarati Cuisine but an simple North Indian one. So good place if your maid is on vacation or Simply if you want to eat out without burning your pocket & stomach.",5,"2018-08-03 17:29:14",26,27,0
