"43480253","Great ambience.
Good service.
Good food.
We were there at late night and service was good and food was yummy. Thank you for that. I think, for a place like that, it's important for the team to maintain / take some sort of pest control measures. The lounge have mosquitoes and I believe it's possible and important to maintain mosquitoe free environment.",3,"2019-03-28 13:18:35",2,1,1

"1614755","Thought to have a great evening here with my kid and wife but was very disappointed to learn that they don't allow kids here. We are responsible parents and know where to take our kids and so we do our home work before going out for dinner, etc. Zomato clearly states that this place is 'kid friendly' and basis that I got my kid here. We felt insulted that you refused us entry to your restaurant. I am going to escalate this matter. So please take this seriously. Besides Zomato has stated in writing that this place is 'kid friendly'. I want a formal apology for this or else be ready to face the consequences. ",1,"2018-12-08 00:16:16",16,120,0

The bartender was very good and prompt at service.
Kudos! ",4,"2018-08-19 23:36:19",53,272,0
"262102","Went with my husband for coffee though it was almost dinner time.
Didn't like the coffee, we had cuppaccinno and latte. It was not great at all. The service was too slow. Initially they gave just spoons and coffee mugs, No saucers were given. Then they gave it on asking, no tissue papers given.
I had to ask for everything which should have been provided on its own.
There were mosquitos in the lounge. Not at all comfortable.",3,"2018-02-17 18:47:44",70,172,0

"473309","Very casual place to sit relax, have a sip and enjoy few snacks.
Love the chandelier!
The person who was serving me was very courteous. I've ordered a chicken snack and masala peanuts along with my beer, both the snack were good.
There were mosquitoes in the evening(Open space after all!) but there was one guy with a mosquito racquet, who makes you feel safe. Thanks to him, I was comfortable.
Piano music was amazing!
Great place to relax with friends, not to be alone. Reading a lot about Happy hours, I didn't know about it. Will have to try next time.",5,"2017-02-17 22:54:48",7,51,0

"841980","Very soothing and calm ambiance. Nice place to relax n have a coffee or a drink after work. I have lazily spent quite a few evenings here, with a sweet live piano performace.
Although the variety of beers available is not extensive, but the bartender, Mohit, whips up some very nice cocktails. 
Do try the regular long island iced tea there, IMO it somehows goes very well with the ambiance at that place",4.5,"2014-09-19 02:55:42",3,2,0
"266443","Been to this place thrice now. Liked it in the first instance itself, but was putting off writing the review due to laziness.
In the midst of the IT corridor, this place is an after-work relax and meet-up place.
The ambiance is awesome, perfect for a relaxing evening. The place is silent and the air conditioning is just perfect, so that you actually feel refreshed after 10 minutes. There is something different about the air quality (might be temperature or freshness), but you actually feel it.
No loud music makes it very comfortable to talk.
And you can spend some time there as no one makes you uncomfortable by asking ""anything else to order"" every 10  minutes.
Coming to drinks, beer, tea and coffee are decently priced. Tea and coffee preparation is good also. We had once tried cocktails also, but they are avoidable.
Snacks are also decent. Specially loved their paneer tikka, which was soft and very mildly flavoured. 
Bottomline:
Best place in that area to sit and lazily spend time after work in a very nice setting. Don't go if you prefer a jazzy or energetic place.",3.5,"2014-05-10 18:58:55",49,532,0
