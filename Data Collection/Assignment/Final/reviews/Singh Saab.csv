"36566953","Recently visited this place opposite dlf for dinner.
We had masala papad, tandoori roti, panner butter masala and aloo gobi.
Food was just decent, panner could have been softer and less elastic but the aloo gobi was fine. The ambience and service were good.
I would rate this restaurant as
Food - 2.5/5
Ambience - 3.5/5
Service - 3.5/5",3,"2019-02-24 12:12:56",98,2969,3

They did not have half of the things available with them. Prices are also high compared to others (in terms of taste and ambience)",1,"2018-12-24 16:59:03",96,221,0

As for the other dishes they were just passable. Nothing exceptional.",2,"2018-08-25 11:34:30",257,1159,0

Very humble and efficient staff, listens to your minute details while placing order. Would love to visit this place with family again to try delicious food. ",5,"2018-08-09 23:03:10",16,59,0
