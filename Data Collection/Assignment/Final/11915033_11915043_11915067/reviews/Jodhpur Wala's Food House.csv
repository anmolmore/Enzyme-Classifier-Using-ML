"1468799","A small North Indian food cravings took me to this place, it was busy and we had ordered a few Butter phulkas and tomato curry and a kaju gravy , The quality of food was decent and the ambience was average , A budget friendly restaurant that serves out decent food.",3,"2019-01-19 20:41:35",70,430,0
"2163462","There are three complaints I have about the food.
It's tasteless - with no spice or seasoning.
Everything we ordered was FLOATING in oil.
The Paneer that we ordered was spoilt.
Will never ever order from here again.",1,"2018-11-26 00:01:11",193,1272,0

"1296747","Tried the restaurant as it was pocket friendly but it didn't turn out to be stomach friendly. The veg burrani starter was tasting okay but was dripping oil. The makki roti and saag was not that good too. ",1,"2018-06-22 09:24:09",119,597,2
"15795291","Had ordered for delivery yesterday. The food arrived hot. I had ordered veg Manchurian, jeera rice, dal makhani and mushroom masala. The dal did not have any flavor. Probably just boiled, added water and salt. That's about it. Mushroom gracy too was a mashup of tomatoes and mushrooms. Jeera andmanchurian were ok. But looks like hygiene isn't maintaned as my stomach isn't good today. Definitely something to avoid!!",1,"2018-06-04 08:49:39",83,233,0
"44461707","I had a worst experience.
ordered Malai kofta( I guess he made it with coconut ) tasted very bad. Never ever order malai kofta here.

"730255","Been to this place on a recommendation of a friend, expecting that the food will be nice with a north indian touch.Â 
Ordered Mutter paneer, Dal tadka, Roti and Jeera Rice. Only Dal tadka can be rated as 3 out of 5, rest of the dishes were disappointing. Paneer was like rubber and was not fresh, the gravy was prepared in coconut oil, Rice was not prepared properly and was tasting bad. Along with this the chapatis were under cooked.Â 
Though this place is pocket friendly but this quality is not acceptable.",2,"2018-01-12 10:49:30",26,59,0

"33093114","A pocket friendly place to eat for everyday.
Ordered jodhpuri paneer curry, tandoori roti, 
aloo and gobi paratha,veg thali and buttermilk.
Every item from here is good and worth the price.
I mostly liked thali and parathas.
place is busy and waiting time is more.
Overall worth a visit.",3.5,"2017-08-10 13:30:22",439,1012,7

"75898","Had two back to back lunch interaction with this place. Yesterday we ordered lunch for first time from here and today we went for lunch (dine in).
First, will review the delivery. We ordered butter phulka, dum aloo punjabi, butter daal fry and jeera rice from this place. We received the delivery bit late but that's ok.  Later, when I'll review the dine in experience, I can give an explanation from my judgement.
The parcel received was well packed and was hot. On taste & quality, I will say only phulka and dum aloo were okayish as the daal had no presence of butter in it and it was like daal juice. Jeera rice was half cooked rice and rest of our day went digesting it.
Today, we got another chance to go out for lunch and we thought of trying parathas here as they are reviewed better. We easily reached the restaurant using google chacha. The place is kept neat & tidy and even without cooler and ac, it was sufficiently cozy. We first took 3 set thali with Kadhai paneer, tondakai, daal, 4 phulka, rice, papad & curd. Reading the statement it feels like this will be sufficient, but it was not for all three of us. So we ordered three parathas as well to suffice our belly. Taste wise the thali items were okayish. Phulka was prepared live and other items were already prepared. Paratha was good and would rate them best here with a note that the preparation time is huge. We almost waited 20 mins for 3 parathas and this is the reason why yesterday the delivery was late. The cooks there are busy preparing phulka for thali and most of the people coming there opt for thali. This delays anything you order other than thali.  So, next time if you are visiting this place for lunch during office break, better go for thali otherwise get prepared to get call from managers ðŸ˜œ
I thought of giving this place a better rating, but, while returning, we were given Patanjali fruit juice packets as complimentary. We were excited till we read the manufacturing date of those packs and found that all of them were expired and there best before date crossed. We didn't even think of giving it to anyone and simply thrown them in dustbin. The only best thing about the place is that it's very pocket friendly.
Food: 2.5/5
Service: Self service
Ambience: 2.5/5

"33813436","Was in Hyderabad for almost 1 month and really wanted to eat something which taste like home made food.
Finally once of my colleague recommended this place to me. When you enter this hotel, it looks pretty simple and clean.
Menu is huge, but i preferred going for the thali and some desi dishes. Trust me you will stop missing your home if you eat here. Food was simple yet tasty. This is a kind of place where you can have lunch on a daily basis if you really crave for some good home made taste.",4.5,"2017-01-17 21:14:05",26,17,0

"14541441","This place is small but always in rush. Be prepared to wait for sometime for the food of you are visiting this place in the evening. This place is known to me for the parathas that they serve. You will get a hell lot of varieties of parathas starting from lachha parathas to aloo-gobi parathas. They are damn good and are one of the best sellers of this place.",3,"2016-08-02 18:20:39",685,792,0

"15772890","Rajasthan and Gujarat are the two states that I regard as a Vegetarianâ€™s Paradise. The states have anything and everything to satisfy a Vegetarianâ€™s taste buds. From the authentic Undhiyu and Dal baati to the luscious Matho and Ghewar, Rajasthanis and Gujaratis will never let you down, at least on the food front. And the best part is you find them everywhere, one such place Iâ€™ll review today is the Jodhpur Walaâ€™s Food House in Gachibowli, Hyderbad....Read full post on socialmaharaj.com",4.5,"2016-01-09 14:06:53",NA,1122,0

Pros - Yummy parathas, hell lot many varieties and must say amazing, finger licking ones.
Cons - Small outlet n evening time - big challenge. It's so rush out here, one cnt imagine. Delivery time on an average 20-25 mins.
But s, if u are a pratha lover... Go for it. ",5,"2015-09-22 13:52:09",57,136,0

"30965736","Decent home like food just like a regular dhaba and its cheap too. If you are a hygiene freak, then probably its not for you. You will always find crowds lingering there mostly girls and guys from hostels.",4,"2015-08-09 10:36:57",12,71,0

"15772890","My only place for north Indian food while I was in PG and probably the only pure vegetarian restaurant there. Very crowded during lunch and dinner all because of the amazing homely taste along with the locket friendly menu. Has lots of variety but we uses to crave for the hot phulkas. Not to forget he has a great collection of ice creams ;)socialmaharaj.com",4.5,"2015-06-13 19:07:05",102,1122,0

"6549771","My love for Rajasthan brought me to this place. I was too bored eating the Idly Sambar served everywhere in Hyderabad and was badly craving for 'ghar ka khana' and just then I found this little place hidden somewhere between the high buildings. In this typical Rajasthani Dhaba, the food that they serve is not just great but also pocket friendly.Â Certainly on my best pocket friendly dine-out places in Hyderabad.",3.5,"2015-02-23 16:54:58",10,5,0
