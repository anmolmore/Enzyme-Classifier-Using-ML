"45833493","I was craving for some cheesy pizza for my dinner. As I already tasted chicken keema pizza here, wanted to try barbecue this time. Ordered from swiggy , The taste was really awesome and my roommates too just loved it a lot. the chicken quantity was good and I can see a layer instead of just stuffing. really nice taste",5,"2019-05-15 09:19:30",146,4699,0

"49207536","I just thought of giving 4 stars for this place but because of the customer service , I cant stop myself from giving 5 star. their manager helped me over the call to choose the best pizza according to my taste. He just blindly promised us about the taste and yeah !! the pizza's were yummy and cheesy. I can see that they use the best quality cheese. So Finally, we got the best ever pizza's. YUMMY, SPiCY and Cheesy.
Thanks Abhinav for helping us in ordering.",5,"2019-05-11 19:22:29",105,49,0

"33726771","Guys ! Believe me , These guys will never disappoint you, I have visited this place and almost tried half of their menu. Every Pizza was different from the other pizza shops. There is no comparison between these guys and the best brands over the city like dominos or pizzahut.
Sharing recently tried pizza pics here. They have the best options if you have a vegan friend, Like they provide HALF AND Half pizzas with our choice. This is really an awesome option. Price is bit high but who cares when the taste is good and the quality is premium?
Will try half of your menu later. A MUST TRY PIZZA Provider Near Gachibowli, Kondapur and Madhapur",5,"2019-05-10 21:47:06",321,5961,0
"43060808","reviewing after trying 4 types in their pizza's . Half n half chicken was too good. I have tried a combination of chicken keema pizza and butter chicken pizza. chicken keema pizza was spicy and cheesy where as the butter chicken pizza , a medium spicy and yummy. Had a good experience with this place. BBQ Monarch pizza is a budget friendly pizza for 1.

"49219989","Overall Experience was but expect the delivery from Zomato & Swiggy.
The delivery guy almost spoiled my pizza but the taste was good. I think zomato and swiggy should take care about the delivery guy‚Äôs bags and other stuff.
Overall taste and quality was good",5,"2019-05-09 22:42:42",76,812,1

"51499836","I will give 4 stars to these guys for pricing and quality but when it comes to taste !! I will give them 5 out of 5.
I'm a foodie and tried almost all the big stores who provide best pizza's but never find any pizza like this. The pizza's they provide are very cheesy and have a high quality bread. The thin crust pizzas they provide are the best
GO FOR IT !! Dont Think ;) . They will satisfy your cravings at midnight without disappointing ;)",5,"2019-05-08 14:44:20",99,1787,2

"31193333","I'm a fan of this place! I've always met disappointment with pizzas in Hyderabad, but this place has changed that for me.. I had the Spicy Chicken Monarch, and I already know that I'm going to keep coming back for more. Perfect flavour, quantity, temperature (surprisingly piping hot) and presentation!

"55429735","Finally i have found a better pizza than dominos and pizzahut. These guys are new in city and delivering the best pizzas ever with full of cheese and chicken.
Quality of the pizzas and their packaging is too good. Tried 3 pizzas here till now and all were so yummy. These guys are giving thin crust on request and its too good.
Their manager responded very quickly and helped me to choose the best pizzas from the menu. Will order again. ",5,"2019-03-22 16:21:06",1,1,0

As usual it was delicious and was also having enough of taste in it. The cheese was also nicely added or I can stuffed in it because it was melting in my mouth. item concept is very good, we can mix two different flavors, the pizza was extremely delicious.",5,"2019-03-07 21:41:51",104,54,1
"49484074","10 POUNDER PIZZATERIA is setting a new benchmark for pizza players. Easily, THE BEST PIZZA I've ever had till date. Super soft crust, premium quality cheese and generously loaded toppings for a very reasonable price is something that should be appreciated. I tried HALF n HALF, which is their flagship item. It gives you a choice of mixing 2 different flavors in one pizza for the same price, so I took ABC (Absolute Butter Chicken) and Chicken Torpedo (Chicken Kheema with Chicken Tikka chunks) together ‚Äì IT WAS MIND BLOWING! I also tried their garlic bread and it was beyond expectations. A MUST TRY!

"63484534","HELL YEAH! Heavenly pizzas at your doorstep. This has to be the best pizza in this whole observable Universe. AMAZING, MIND-BLOWING, MIND-BLASTING and wat not! I am running out of superlatives. I have tried Schezwan Chicken and Spicy Chicken Monarch. Both these pizzas were excellent and I would definitely try their whole menu. The time has come when the Italians should now come here to learn how a real pizza is made. Guys, this is the place to visit if you are a pizza lover. I have tasted 3-4 pizzas till date and I have to say that I can keep eating these pizzas daily, literally..KUDOS!",5,"2019-03-04 13:50:10",84,58,2
"36809558","Yes it is the best pizza I have had in Hyderabad... Their concept of serving half n
half pizza is awesome; one can taste two pizzas at the same time...you won't know why people so crave their Pizzas until you taste it yourself. It had the
rightly roasted toppings; the perfectly prepared soft dough to the most exotic
sauces. 10 POUNDER fulfilled all our pizza cravings with its mouthwatering
pizzas! So if you have not visited this place yet, you are really missing some
good pizzas in life.pandareviewz.com",5,"2019-03-03 15:58:38",93,6174,1

"1617022","Last week I went to gachibowli I tried 10 Pounder Pizzateria - a heavenly place for pizza lovers. If you have not tried their pizzas, pls do it ASAP. This place has to be in your bucket list of restaurants. Mind blowing pizza varieties, super soft crust, toppings with all that desi twist and what not! It is an online cum delivery store, although the management is so courteous tht if u go there and ask for dine in, they will not disappoint you. Cheers!
