"37834422","This was one of the least expected places that gave us tasty food. Frankly, we entered this restaurant only because it was way past lunch time and couldn't find any restaurants. Also because we were starving. After seeing the place we didn't have much expectation, we just wanted to fill our tummies.
We ordered a chicken manchurian starter, veg fries rice and hot and sour soup for the two of us. The food was actually tasty in a home food kind of way and quantity was more than enough for two. It was a good experience. ",4,"2018-08-26 22:59:18",24,122,0
