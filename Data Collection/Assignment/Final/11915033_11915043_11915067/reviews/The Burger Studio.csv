"32001021","When u are a vegetarian be aware they will send u non veg stuff. Plus zomato , u will remember the videos that were shared in social media. Their staff is hungary so will have a bite on way. Burger is stone cold, probably made in morning for evening deliveries. Best part is zomato delivery boy as per profile can speak hindi and english but when u tell issue has no clue what u talking about.",1,"2019-01-12 17:52:44",1,13,0

"873715","Ordered their signature chicken burger. The meat patty tasted like boiled & minced soyabean. I took small bites of meat 2-3 times to verify if, by mistake, they delivered wrong item. Finally had to throw the minced stuff away.
There is nothing nice about the food unfortunately.",1,"2019-01-08 16:18:21",40,32,0
"388589","I ordered their TBS Signature Chicken Burger along with crispy wings + drum and I was very much underwhelmed with the burger. 
They advertise the burger being served with fries, lettuce, crispy onions, tomato and signature sauce but what I got was some soggy onions with a defrosted patty in an over toasted crispy bun. Everything else was missing, even the add on cheese for which I paid extra.
The coating on wings was good but then there was minimal to no meat inside.
Their signature spicy sauce was okish, I have had better.",1,"2018-12-29 19:15:22",10,35,0
