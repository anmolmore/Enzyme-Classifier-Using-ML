Good food + Good drinks + Great DJ + Nice ambience sums up my experience.

Otherwise it is a good place to hang around if you like loud music. I wouldn’t recommend this place for a girls group to go to.",2,"2019-05-11 16:36:00",47,117,0

"35376281","The ambience was decent, but we went for a ladies night and it was a tad bit crowded (understandable!). The music was good, the only downside to the whole thing was that the person giving out drinks at the counter was downright ignoring us. We actually became a little uncomfortable after that, because we were right in front of him, waving hands (not drunk at all, because we were asking for out first drink of the night), and he was handing out drinks to everyone else except us. Looks like he had something againts us! ;)",3,"2019-05-04 10:16:17",3,8,0

We cant even breathe properly.Then we order vodka..it was like water and when we questioned them he smiled and kind of agreed.Then we ordered Long island Tea and asked him to make it a good one but it was even worse. Even their virgin mohito was not gud.Then the food was also okish.Staff were also not courteous.I find the place was overcrowded. It seemed they have allowed stag entries and they were passing cheap comment on us.I will never recommend anyone here.",1,"2019-04-27 16:08:12",1,9,0

"34637683","Club Rogue is a nice place to hangout with friends and have a laid back beer on a weekday as well. The service is excellent. The menu has lots of options in veg as well as non veg.

"36263035","Club rogue ... located in Gachibowli is a good place party and dance if you have gone out with your friends on weekends. The place is usually full and suggestion would be to go in early and get yourself a table. Here you can have some drinks and then dance and yes the food is also quite good. Only issues .... the tables are small, and hence not much can be placed on the table. Saw lots of bottles fall and break. But regardless, this is a good place if you really wanna party hard.",4,"2019-04-21 08:49:02",59,182,0
"32744176","Whole club is a friendly place for smokers which becomes a problem for people who don't smoke.
I went to this club with my friends around 8. It was fine then but slowly the suffocation started. There is no proper ventilation, guessing based on the experience I had. Whichever club, I have been to, there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking. The restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue. But here at this place, i couldn't see an open window. It was all dark! I think they really took ""Rogue"" word to another level.
I couldn't enjoy at all, came from there when it was too much for me, now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke.
I would really want Club Rogue to address this issue, it was very depressing for me and I think the same was felt by so many people over there.",1,"2019-04-21 01:18:54",1,0,0

When we managed to make a waiter arrange a table for us, he just keeps a table in the middle of the way and asks us to stand throughout our course for the evening... Well we finally made to a normal table by waiting for others to vacate.... I highly recommend not to go to this place....

"1471870","Been to Club Rogue last Saturday I.e. 13th April 2019. We chose this place as it was a Bollywood night. Lot of things to get told about this place.
First, coming to the ambience. It's a nice big place. The pricing is reasonable. We were given a place of our liking after a little followup.
Now coming to the attitude & rules of the club. The entrance has a prominent display which says, only couple allowed in after 7pm. Easily 10 bounces at the entrance, but inside- NIL! In spite of the display board saying only couples, they have allowed stags in. The dance floor was unchecked. Anyone could dance, feel you or ogle at you and not one single staff to monitor anything.
The Bollywood songs started at 11.10pm! I don't know what were they waiting for till so late to start playing Bollywood music.
Overall, a nice place but definitely enter this place with caution & at your risk & evaluate your need to visit this place.
Service was good. We were attended to well, by our server Mr. Kunal. ",2,"2019-04-17 14:02:13",25,73,0

"38338461","Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.
Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.
I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.
The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place. Lot of cheap crowd on Saturday night better to avoid.",2,"2019-04-15 13:47:59",1,22,0

"2372532","Cheap place. 
Really bad service.
This place has a quiet weird rule. If you show your office ID card they’ll not be charging a cover amount. Else you’ll have to pay a cover charge. 
The bar attenders are so ill mannered, I was almost about to slap one.
If you can’t talk to a customer politely, then maybe you should not work at a bar! 
I’ve asked for a Budweiser but he gave me a kingfisher and then insisted that I ordered kingfisher. (I’m okay with the argument part but he said drink it or get out which made me furious).
Food was average and served medium hot (I think I was served someone else’s cancelled order item)
Music was terrible! There was some desi dj who was playing songs out of YouTube and there was no quality mixing.

The place is also very beautiful. But the service here sucks, the waiters are rude. We couldn't order food as the waiters weren't responding properly. Even for drinks (tired of waiting for them to take order) we went to the bar and ordered.

"102497204","I went to club rouge since the day it started,I have been to this place more than 150 times.It was like a hangout place for us to always go.It was beautiful in the starting,less crowd and only couples were allowed to dance floors and people dint stand on tables and all that time to dance.Bouncers were pretty good at that time and the manager at that time was also very nice and polite.In the past few months since the manager changed,his name is siddharth the club rougue we knew was no more there.This angry little manager is the worst human u could ecer talk to.Single girls beware to go to this place.They allow cheap bastards into the club who doesn't drink and doesn't even have a table,they keep roaming all around the club to find girls and talk with them or make em uncomfy by staring at them and not moving from there table.I even saw a guy putting a tablet into some girls drink.Coming to my incident,Yesterday i went to this place to watch afternoon ipl match which was at 4.We went there at 5 and it was happy hours,which we don know or never cared about happy hours in clubs.We started watching match and at 6 a waiter comes saying pls pay bill since happy hours is ended.We said okay and we paid.Now the waiter says please leave, we were like wtf we came to watch the match and we will leave only after it's done.Then he calls the manager.His name is SIDDHARTH.This guy is one horrible crap who thinks since he is the manager of the club he's an avenger superhero.He came to us and said which a very tone u people have to leave,I told that's not happening we are hyderabadi's and it's srh match and we will leave only when it's done and he started shouting and telling no with so much attitude.Later he said 30mins and left.He wasn't coming when I was calling him also.He comes after 30mins and says go,When we told we will not leave until the match is done he told he will call bouncers and make us leave,We were so frustrated and angry we told call them and let them decide who's wrong here.Then he told that club rougue owner(MD) is NARSINGH RAO and he is a big local goon and he threatened us that once u leave this place some unknown people will come and hit and break our bones if we say anything to SIDDHARTH (the manager).People go to clubbing to have fun and in the end all we got was a life threat.And moreover this place became a sick place,it stinks and waiters will force u to give more tip saying 2 ppl served u and all.And the cheap guy stags who come inside with influence and think they are hottest models 😂.Sorry for the long review but i think they deserve it.The manager SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH Thanks for making me realize that i should never come back to club rougue and make bills around 20k each time I visit the club.And thanks for making me realize that I should not suggest this place to anyone.His name is SIDDHARTH and the he is HERO of club rougue.",1,"2019-03-25 16:33:24",1,35,0

"51436418","So this is not the review for good music/ambience/food/drink. 
This is for the manager who was outside at the gate. 23rd March, 2019. We were three friends, and the bouncer at the gate asked for company ID, as we were stags. One of my friend called another, who was on the way, whether he was carrying his ID proof. 
In the mean time that Manager appeared at the gate. 
We went to the gate and showed the ID, but he looked at us head to toe, and made a disgusting face and asked for 2k cover charge. Without any reason. 
Some other stag groups were entering; just showing company ID. 
But this manager asked 2k cover charge from us, and we saw, he did same with another three guys group. 
We didn’t make any nuisance there, and silently left the place. 
So , tell me Club Rogue why this discrimination?

Cons: Entry ONLY for ppl who show corporate ID is kinda too much. And also rude behaviour of bouncers. Instead of making us feel safe, they themselves scares the customers.

The service was the worst.. All of my friends went to the dance floor and I was stopped by the staff who asked not to leave the table and asked me to deposit my id card. This was pretty humiliating. This place probably sees too many dine & dash incidents given the kind of crowd it caters to. 
The food was average at best. 
They entered ₹200 as tip on the pos machine trying us to pay that for this s***ty service.

To start with, the place does not have well groomed and professional staff, they hardly understand what you speak.
The first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10, we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us. As soon as we got seated, a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people, we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly, but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming, it was not even 6 PM then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us. We told him that incase more crowd comes we will move.
Secondly, we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses, when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don't have any. We had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly.
The service was slow, we had to keep looking for waiters.
We were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 PM, but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6.50 PM saying by they serve it would cross 7 PM. Doesn't that sound ridiculous?
Again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones, when the argument was not stopping I suggested my friends that we should go to 10D, to which the waiter present said we should go to 10D they use glass tumblers, after he said that we demanded meeting the Manager.
The Manager came and he was a nightmare, he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us, when we said we will give bad rating/ review the Manager said ""Ok Sir, we are also dangerous people"" we were shocked at this.
Our evening was spoilt already, so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere.
This place is not at all professional, the staff and their business ethics are horrible, will never visit ever.",1,"2019-02-19 15:59:42",24,43,0

Dedicated Dance floor with good Hindi new and old songs to garnish upon. Too loud though. Don’t have draught beer. Have pint prices slightly towards higher side. Crispy corn made the day ( night! ).

"31923087","Very unprofessional and rude staffs. If you order 2 beers, they will insist for a bucket and if you do not order a bucket, they will take half an hour to bring your order. The place is overcrowded during weekends and there is no proper crowd management of any sort. Then the waiters say that because it is overcrowded, orders can't be processed properly. Despite all that inconvenience and bad service, they force you for paying the tip and even argue over how much you want to pay. Crowd is very indecent and sometimes vulgar and there is no provision for crowd control given that the place is overcrowded. Music and DJ is good with cheap food and drinks, which is a crowd puller. One can have a really nice time if you can bear all these and if crowd is what attracts you.",1,"2019-02-10 13:24:08",3,2,0

"32223247","An amazing place to let loose and free yourself of an entire day's/ week's slog.
Food : decently priced, huge helpings. One dish likely to suffice for two. Unless, of course... ;)
Drinks : large+ rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200. What else could one ask for? Unless, one finds better pleasure in other drinks... ;) Beer bucket prices ~900. So... Yeah good place to get the buzz.
Dance : the heart and soul of the place. DJs do a great job, generally. It's EDM untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of Punjabi, Bollywood and popular English. If you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the DJ plays. But every other day, he/she does surprise you.
Fridays and Saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. Couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (Just saying)

"2562074","We were there in a group of 9, for drinks last weekend. And we had the most horrible experience ever. Happy hours were till 7, but they were very reluctant to take any orders in the last 30min.We had to call them repeatedly, and then they came dragging their feet. When we were placing orders at 6:50pm, they said, it wasn't counted under happy hours. No explanation given. Shady ambience and very diluted drinks Food was OK. The worst part is that they were serving the drinks in plastic glasses, real shabby ones. We asked for proper glasses and they told us to go to 10D.. I mean.. Really?? Asking 9 customers to get lost?? We were unhappy with the server's response, and wanted to talk to the manager, who was even worse. He outrightly threatened us saying they were dangerous people and it would not be safe for us.. Really!?! LIKE REALLY???
Anyways we got the hell out of there and went somewhere else.. But it was a very unpleasant experience. Club rogue indeed has rogues running it. Would advise everyone to stay away. ",1,"2019-02-04 21:25:44",66,192,0

"15598907","The worst place in the city, I was here for a few drinks with my friends and it was during the happy hours (which is till 6pm) and they were so adamant in taking our order at 5.50 stating happy hours were closed, we had to literally tell them that we were still in happy hours to ask for that price, surprisingly they didn't like it and the drinks were diluted. What surprised me the most was that they were serving everything in plastic glasses? Like seriously? Serve drinks in a plastic glass? When speaking to the waiter he said - go to 10D they serve drinks in glasses and not plastic, it was so rude for him to say that. I asked him to call his manager and told him the story to which he says his boss asked to serve in plastic glasses and kept explaining that it was his boss's order, he was just not able to understand what I was explaining to him - I bigger issue was about the way the waiter had spoken to me and when even after sometime I realised he was not interested in what I was saying, I was furious and used F word to which he said you can use F word but we are also very dangerous people? Like what dangerous? He was absolutely okay with me writing this review as they felt they didn't have any obligation towards customer service. It was not something they were giving me for free and to compensate he was willing to give me discount and also call the waiter to apologies to me - I didn't need someone's apology - what matters the most is their service and looks like it does not appear anywhere on their list of how to sustain in the business.

"257990","This place has a great ambience and beautiful views inside. I visited this place with a group of friends.It is a bigger and spacious place. It's indeed great a place to hang out with friends. This pub has dedicated dance floor and entry was allowed inside after 7Pm only. The DJ starts playing after 10PM. They have tried to create an ambiance of a night club but there is no specific dance floor. So the place doesn't really serve any specific purpose. Also the service isn't very prompt and you will have to chase the staff to get your order. And towards the end of the night, the food quality degrades.Food and drinks with reasonable prices but they lack in service it has to be improved . Nice reasonable place, everything is fine except the one thing that Waiter asks for tips ridiculously and are very adamant on that. This is pretty unacceptable. Authority es like management any one comes across this review, my suggestion is, please provide proper training on professional mannerisms and customer management. Otherwise I would definitely give 5 stars.
