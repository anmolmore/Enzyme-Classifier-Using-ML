I ordered Shawarma platter. I thought I was gonna get a pita bread but instead got a pile of rumali rotis with mayonnaise in between.
Shawarma had elaichi... There were some 8-10 french fries.
Agar Bakhili karna hi tha, toh sab alag alag bechte, platter kyun rakha?? ",1,"2018-11-24 02:50:09",17,47,0
