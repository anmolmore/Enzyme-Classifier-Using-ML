"132958","Didn’t know Smoky Pitara had opened in Gachibowli until I saw it on Swiggy! Think they’re in the Platina building on the Gachibowli - Kondapur road.
Ordered some Veg Spring Rolls, Veg Fried Rice & Chilly Paneer Wet. The fried rice & Chilly Paneer were ace, suitably spiced and well garnished. The Paneer was soft and fresh which complimented the gravy very well. Spring rolls were a bit oily and smelled funny though. 
We’d been to their JHills outlet couple of times and glad to know they’ve opened up another outlet close by. Another pure veg place is a welcome addition  :-) ",4,"2018-08-12 00:43:46",166,459,0
