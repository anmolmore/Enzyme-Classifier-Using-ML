"1378629","Ordered today from here for evening snacks sandwiches, pasta salad and shakes. The shakes weren't good and the sandwiches were too small like 20-30 rupees sandwiches. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Stop selling these substandard food and calling yourself a cafe.",2,"2019-05-17 21:32:26",84,719,0
"29973853","My go to place whenever I wish to have aloo Paratha. Yes ! It's simply the best, feels like home. Nice and quiet place. The carrom board, board games add to the fun.",5,"2019-04-06 17:59:05",25,5,0
"46845056","Food : 5/5 Very good in taste.¬†
Ambiance : 5/5 Cozy ambiance. Have board games to enjoy the time there. Nice decor.
Friendly people.
Have a very nice time :)",5,"2019-03-13 10:33:51",62,57,0
"32044761","""A place to hangout with friends"" is exactly what describes it. Located in the heart of the hubbub yet far from it, its a very good place to just lounge with friends or cousins, extra points for all the board games they provide.
I tried the supreme veggie üçî and it was neither great nor bad. But it was a bit pricey with extra charge on the cheese. Only complaint being the patty used in burger being from a frozen patty pack.",3,"2019-03-12 16:46:32",3,1,0

"941489","Been here thrice and was never disappointed. It‚Äôs a small cozy place to relax and please your taste buds. Italian delicacies are served fresh and hot in home made style, food is truly amazing. The ambience and music soothes you weirdly. You got board games and cards to play and let your trivial conversations blind you off the clock.
Must try : Home style fusilli pasta.",4,"2019-01-14 10:07:42",2,65,0
"30307683","Granny's Art Cafe has a very extensive range of menu. They have a lot of items to offer. We ordered A burger, sandwich, and a wrap.
You can customize¬†them according to your need. All of them were quite¬†good but they had a lot of cheese them, which overpowered the taste of other ingredients in it.
They have a riddle on their packaging making it very interesting.
Overall,A decent place to order food from!!!",4,"2018-12-30 15:13:36",179,1874,2
"34920544","Sometimes,you keep visiting places one after the other but deep in your mind,you long the homely taste.What if both of these were combined?
That exactly is the best thing about this cafe.Not only is it reasonable,it adds a granny's love flavour to all the dishes.It is amazing to meet a cute granny bringing you everything you need",5,"2018-12-28 17:40:20",60,37,0
"33620276","I love that they're a little extra with the love they put into their food. They leave handwritten notes, riddles, occasionally throw in a muffin or some sweets! They've packed in these mini delights each time I've ordered from them.
Their burgers are delicious. I'd recommend the cheesy egg burger to start with.
Lots of love to all of you at Granny's!",5,"2018-12-26 18:43:24",1,5,0
"30171042","We got food home delivered and it tasted good but the quantity of it was a little disappointing. Burgers specifically were much smaller. Pasta was delightfully good ‚ò∫Ô∏è they added some creativity by placing a quiz kinda thing over one of the packs. ",3,"2018-12-17 01:07:47",96,350,0
"50201224","Been here unplanned and turned out amazing. What really impressed me is their idea and the ambience!! They turned a home into a beautiful food place with homely feeling. The chef is the granny and who doesn‚Äôt like the granny‚Äôs food. Kudos to the management. The night mode of this place is top notch very dim lighting (saving some real money on electricity üòÇ) gave a good vibe. There are certain board games which keeps you entertained. I think the carrom board must be replaced üòÖ 
Speaking of food, ordered vermicelli and home made chai üòç. 
Vermicelli: The quality and the quantity was quite good, satisfying the taste of it. 
Chai : A perfect home made chai to clear your strees! 
Burger: Since it‚Äôs a veggie store, i was forced to order a veg burger but i did not regret ordering it as soon as i had first bite.
*An ideal place to crash yourself at evenings *",3,"2018-11-30 06:44:24",111,449,5
"15572180","Far better burger than the large chains.
Followed instructions given
The filling egg or veg both were good
Always take the grilled option. Grilled bun tastes far better.
Would be great if you can have a chicken burger",4,"2018-11-22 21:34:23",46,39,0

"30282795","This place is probably the coziest and cutest cafe in Hyderabad that I've visited. Beautiful homely ambience. Great food quality. Value for money pricing. Jenga and other board games available. Plays the latest English music. The best part about this place is that it's run by a cute family of three: an elderly couple and a young lady who is probably their daughter. They are super friendly and welcoming. A great experience. Will surely visit again. Please be aware that this cafe is set up in a home, so there's limited seating available.",5,"2018-10-31 23:43:50",23,215,0
"33947690","Granny's Art Cafe isn't food, it's an experience, gather a group of friends and visit this place, the place makes you get comfortable instantly, making it feel very homely.
The interior is a perfect example of a budget interior that looks absolutely stunning! The board games, out of which Jenga would be my pick when going with friends.
My rating goes 4 star because I feel the food can be improved, the food quality is decent but not perfect that would fetch it a perfect 5. Pizzas are good, sandwiches need improvement and Salads need to be revamped completely.
Always looking forward to visiting again :)",4,"2018-10-28 15:45:11",49,715,0
"57109409","We have just ordered maggi and sandwich.. the price is too high for the quantity they offer.. the taste is too bad.. and the quality is too bad..

"33503433","Went there on a Sunday night when we were running short of some ingredients to make a dish at home owing to the closeness of the place. Was quite impressed by the place. Following summaries my experience-:
Ambiance- Such a warm and homely place. There is a lot of simplicity in the ambiance and yet feels so gorgeous- a rare amalgamation. It is done up in wooden furniture with ample board games, carrom and novels to help you while away your time whilst awaiting your order. They have these small show pieces and artifacts here and there, a counter at one end to pay your bill and a kitchen which will resemble your own kitchen at home. Very good English numbers which will soothe you up are played. 5/5 for the homely feel and the great use of LED lights.
Service- The set up seems to be run by a mother and daughter who live in the very building. The service isn't fast because everything seems very fresh and warm. The hospitality by the mom daughter duo is what wins. They aren't very quick which is why the board games and novels are kept but they are warm and friendly. 4/5
Food- Now what happens when a great ambiance meets good service meets good food? Magic happens. We tried the following-:
Multigrain grannys special sandwich- What impressed me in the sandwich was the detailed grilling of the bread to perfection and the bread itself. As such the filling was the usual tomatoes, onions, capsicum and a few sauces- nothing different. But the bread made this a winner. I seldom find such great and crispy bread. 4/5
Aaloo Hot garlic Tortilla- If you like jalapenos, then you got your pick. I personally do not like tortillas and hence didn't like it. On the other hand, my husband loves jalapenos and on his behalf would give this a 3.5/5. The tortilla shell is nice and sturdy.
Onion and capsicum omelette- A good omelette which can help you Kickstart your day on a good note. Ample onions and capsicum. A suggestion- Guys please serve atleast two slices of bread. 4/5 if the bread was served.
Cinnamon Tea- Tasted to the core of cinnamon. Very mildly sweet with a complete taste of cinnamon. if you detest cinnamon, you may not like this at all. Nice and refreshing. 4/5
Superman Pizza- Now this is what I call a yummy pizza. Ample tomatoes, onions and paneer with a mesmerising pickled taste which will linger on your finger tips and mind even when you go home. I would definitely order this again the next time. #HighlyRecommended. 5/5
Cheesy garlic bread- You have to, just have to order this. 4 humongous garlic baguette circles topped with mozzarella. The bread seemed to be their own product- but not sure. The oregano with these just made my evening brighter. 5/5
True Chocolate Shake- A nice shake which was quite sweet and was optimal on the amount of chocolate. Nothing very outstanding but good. 3.5/5
Kitkat Shake- Loved this. To be honest it had no taste of KitKat but it was yummy. It had a nice brownie like taste. Do try this. Will cover up your chocolaty pangs. 4/5
Coleslaw Multigrain Sandwich- This was also fine but costly for the price. I found it very small and the coleslaw was less in quantity. Okayish to be honest. 3/5
Veg Burger- Very well grilled bun which is very different than the run of the mill ones. The taste is exactly similar to Mc Veggie from MC Donald's. Just one difference here- this one has some spicy sauce in between. Really good. 4.5/5
Lemon iced tea- It's the usual you can make at home, served in a fancy way with mint leaves. Nothing different. 2.5/5
Cold coffee- The daughter among the mother daughter duo recommended this one which made me try it. In a nutshell, it was nothing exceptional or different. I would skip it. I have had much better. 2.5/5
Will I come back here again? A big Yes. I loved the pizza, cheesy garlic bread and found the sandwich and omelette decent enough to pull me back. This place seemed as a home away from home.",4,"2018-09-24 00:42:47",316,1157,4
"576043","Amazing cafe, brilliant hospitality, great place to hang out with friends (they also have some board games).

"55991818","Been ordering regularly from this place through Zomato/Swiggy. The latest order was garlic omelette, blueberry yoghurt and banana muffins. The omelette was simple and classy as always. The yoghurt and muffins were a surprise delight! Granny's are probably the best in the town for comfort food. I wonder why did they stop serving Indian classics (the likes of poha, rajma chawal) online. Also, It will be great if they can add the quintessential Indian comfort food, our beloved - 'khichdi' üòá
All in all, it's a great place and a giant in making.
PS - would be even better if they slash prices for some of the dishes(say by about 20% or so)
Cheers!

"12671941","This is how a house is converted into a restaurant. The hospitality is brilliant and the place truly feels like home.

"32116882","Awful white sauce Pasta. It was not at all creamy, veggies were just for the name and the whole thing was runny.

"42444","I have recently become fairly regular to this quaint little cafe run by a nice family. The cafe is small but has nice rustic interiors. 
You will feel like you are visiting someone‚Äôs house for food. It has a big menu of veg and egg based dishes. All the dishes have a distinct home cooked feel and they are less on oil and has good healthy options. 
The service will take a while but dont worry you will have board games and carrom to keep you entertained. 
Do try the sandwiches and omlettes here. ",4,"2018-08-18 14:41:49",59,265,0
"207480","I used to be regular at their Kondapur branch, but then I moved to Bangalore and they moved to Gachibowli. But when I was visiting Hyd, I made sure to visit Granny's and I loved it just as much as I loved it then.
Good food, good vibes!
I was a little surprised with relatively low rating, but you see all the 3 star reviews - yeh delivery wale log hain.
You should really visit this place for a Sunday brunch or for a rainy day hangout to get a feel of the place.
Don't get me wrong, the food is great! It's just much better when had here.
