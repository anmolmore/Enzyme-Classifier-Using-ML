"58967463","I can't describe how worse the food is .. I ordered Dosa and Mysore bonda both were stale and chutney was literally smelling bad. I usually order food but never had this kind of experience. Wish there's an zero rating to give. Please don't order from this. Forget about the taste; I can't eat at all. Wasted my time and money.

"416245","The Latest Update:
Last night i ordered food (after a long time)....  this time the food quality had deteriorated a lot. The idily's were stale, it looked like it was re-heated. The Idili floor has become stale and was tasting very bad. How could someone who's whole business runs on idilies serve such Bad idilies. I was worried for my Kids health and had to discard the whole batch of food i got.  
Older version:
This place serves a lot of chicken combos which you otherwise don't get it. I have not been there but have ordered from there a lot of time. And I have only ordered there different tiffin combos. This place is VFM and the quality of food you get for the money you pay is excellent.",2,"2019-02-16 09:46:40",46,67,0
"36523232","I haven’t visited this place yet. Ordered online from here. The delivery 🚚 was on time. They have very good pocket friendly combos in my opinion. They are bit too spicy 🌶 🌶 🌶 🌶 
Try 1. Masala dosa. It was really nice and had good amount of masala dosa inside. It went well with the sambar. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Try 2. 2 dosa + chicken 🍗 curry 🍛 combo. Good amount of pieces were there. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Try 3. 2 dosa + chicken gravy combo. This is a very good option. They are giving the same gravy of what they serve for chicken curry but without pieces. Nice cheap alternative. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
My rating : 
1. Food : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.5
2. Ambience:  yet to visit 
3. Service: yet to visit 
Must try 😋 :
1. Dosa+ chicken 🍗 combos ",4,"2019-02-02 10:51:31",176,3777,0

"50303592","Worst food I ever had. It was stale and tasteless. Poori was missed from the order. Zomato is not concerned for missing items and this restaurant is not picking calls. Worst service and food. Bandiwaaala is 100 times better than this restaurant. I throwed the food as the chutney given to me was sour like prepared a day back. And they packing in news papers which is health hazard... sense less.",1,"2019-01-21 02:25:56",2,1,0
