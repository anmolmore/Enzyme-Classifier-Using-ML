"76416995","Extremely disappointing. It took more than one hour to prepare the food. When inquired to the restaurant, I was told that the delivery boy had gone to deliver but got opposite response from delivery boy, that the food is still in preparation. No proper salt, don't know how they cook it. Totally devastating. ",1,"2018-11-10 17:43:38",1,0,0
