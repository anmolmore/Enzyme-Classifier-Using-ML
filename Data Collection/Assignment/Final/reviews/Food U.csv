"33939853","Food U has always been a place I'd like to go after a tough day. The Nutella milkshake was just the thing I needed. It was with a perfect proportion of Nutella and vanilla. As a person I like my milkshake extra sweet hence I did not mind the sweetness of the shake. However, I did not mention it seperately and others might not want so much sugar.

"48740558","I ordered a 3 idiots milkshake. The packaging was impressive. The milkshake tasted very well. The best part, the uniformity in composition. I could feel a multitude of flavours. Only suggestion is to cut down a little on the amount of sweetness in the shake. Cheers :)",5,"2018-04-19 17:45:22",1,2,1

Ordered banana chocolate, surprised with the quick delivery. shake was too thick which I like the most, Although it was hot outside, food u delivered a very chilled shake. Packaging was really cool.
