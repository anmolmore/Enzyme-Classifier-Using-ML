"31699452","Situated at the heart of the town, this is by far the best place to lay your hands on Arabian and Yemeni dishes in the City of Nawabs. With stiff competition from more than a dozen other restaurants in the area, the prices are average but the Quality is exceptional. The ambience of the place is exceptional and with adequate lights which are extremely soothing to the eyes. Food apart, the whole setup of the restaurant creates a Unique Aura for all food lovers.
Note :- Plz do try the BBQ Chicken Mandi and the Juicy Chicken Mandi. They are the best items from the whole menu.

"50985881","I had been here with my office colleagues for lunch. We order malai chicken and mix chicken mandi. I earlier had mandi at different places in Hyderabad but this place was awesome. They had nice interiors with seating arrangements. If you are not comfortable seating on the rug then you can sit on table and chair. For food I would rate it 5+ for amazing taste, quantity and for that Arabian food feel. We order 2 mandi and we all 8 of us were so full and started feeling sleepy. As it was lunch time we had to build some courage and go to office:-)...will be visiting again to try some Mutton mandi.",5,"2019-05-05 13:04:36",5,23,1

"35164008","Have always been a fan of the Shawarma of this place. Therefore wanted to try the mandi as well. But was utterly disappointed with the quality of rice being served. By no means it seemed to be mandi rice. It was more like Pulao rice. Considering the price that I paid the quality was no match for it. Mandi rice is never sticky but in this case it was. Kindly look into the image and you will understand.",1,"2019-04-28 17:06:02",22,62,1
"33519259","I like this place for shawarma but mandi was pathetic. It contained pulao rice. Full sticky no cashews. Really not the kind of mandi i was expecting from this place. Really pathetic Mandi",1,"2019-04-28 16:59:10",2,39,0
"6416581","I came to know this place through my colleague. We went here for a team lunch.
And this place is one of the best ideas to have team lunches. As Mandi is specially a platter for 2 and more people can eat together.
Ambience- normal and okay
Service - fast and good
Food taste - quite good and worthy
Ordered chicken wings mandi and barbeque chicken mandi, chicken is tender and tasty, rice is flavourful and quantity is great.
Veg mandi is okay but not so tasty
Bas bousa -3/5 . I am trying for the 1st time. Taste is great but its quite dry
Overall xperience is great for huge teams ",4,"2019-04-26 22:18:38",59,117,0
"54028481","We went for my birthday dinner here. There ambience is beautiful to say the least, the stuff is quite courteous. We had chicken Mandi, kebabs, and kaddu ka kheer. Although kaddu ka kheer was a bit too liquid for us, we loved our food. This place isn't really pocket friendly, but totally worth the money.",5,"2019-04-20 16:35:46",6,1,0

"1226217","We were 2 friends wanted to eat some mandi.. I know some is not the right word when it comes to mandi.. With that huge plate and all.. So yum yum tree is a great place to eat mandi. It was around 2o clock in noon when we visited..the place is very calm and not on main road but its easy to find.
Ambience is spot on arabic, songs played are romantic. The guy who served us had a smile on his face all the time he's serving us. Nothing to complain about the place at the same time nothing to praise too.
We ordered bbq chiken mandi and grill fish..
Grill fish was oki dint like it much but my friend loved it.. She likes fish may be thats why!
BBQ chiken mandi was amazing i can place them in top 5 mandis in hyderabad..! Trust me with a lot of mandi places its a tough to be on top 5...Bbq chiken pieces wer juicy and very flavour full...they give you mayonise and chutney to go along! Prices are very pocket friendly...you can visit with family, friends or girlfriend. Its a perfect place for mandi.. Definitely going again! ",4,"2019-04-06 12:58:41",29,66,2

"39524626","I just wonder how people praise the food and service.
Maybe the day was different for me but I was really very dissapointed with the service they had given. We asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi. I hate such late servings.
Mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. Instead I find it better at other places.
Ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. However the choice of music could have been better.
Overall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate. ",3,"2019-03-10 03:08:45",17,8,1

We were about 10 of us and got a chance to try a lot of starters and they were all good. The flag bearer at this place is the Mandi. You need atleast 5 folks mop it.

"34023006","This branch is in one of the interior areas in the hitech city.
Ambiance: The ambiance is rich and has good feel and better ambiance compared to the other branches
Food: We had the mixed mandi platter which is like 1k+ but really huge with good variety of chicken grill, tandoori, mutton, french fries, etc.
The rice is also fine and is accompanied by good amount of fried onion and cashew nuts and other sides like mayo and tomato chutney.
We also had the teriyaki burger which was not upto the mark of the long lost taste of the original yum yum tree.

Yum yum tree is one of the best restaurants in Hyderabad specialised in Arabic Mandi. Yum yum tree has one of it's outlet at Gowlidoddy, exactly above Art Botique hotel. Yum yum tree has one of the finest ambiance in Gachibowli area. Indoor as well as outdoor sitting is available. Live sports screening is available at the terrace.
Food-
Yum yum tree is famous for it's Arabic Mandi, they also serve various kinds of starters and shawarmas. We placed an order for Chicken Stick Mandi and Chicken Barbeque Mandi. Chicken stick Mandi has 6-7 boneless chicken pieces, which were tasted perfectly with Mandi rice. Half Chicken barbeque Mandi included 2 large barbeque chicken pieces served with 2 types of gravies.
Service -

"34072147","Once, we have ordered chicken special cheese shawarma from this restaurant and it was very yummy. So, today out of the blue me and my husband thought of trying their mandi also. We have already heard a lot about mandi in their restaurant.. We went for lunch and there was waiting. We waited for 15mins to get Arabian seat. After having mandi I can only say one thing, try at once. But keep in mind its a good place for non-vegeterians..",5,"2018-12-30 16:10:00",44,867,5

"8267981","As the name says: If you want to checkout the yummy Arabian food in Hyderabad, then this your place.
The ambience is very spacious and resembles the Arabic style of interior decor and seating. This also has camel prototype placed in the entrance.
If you're a hater of sea food, you will start loving it after eating the Grill Fish Tikka from here.
Food we tried here:
Chicken BBQ Tikka
Grill Fish Tikka
Chicken Arabian Mix Mandi
All the 3 items that we tried here are the best of it's kind. Chicken BBQ Tikka is the best of the grilled chicken that I have tried before. Grill Fish Tikka comes with a single complete grilled fish without any bones. It just melts in your mouth and if you try it with white mayonnaise it tastes the best.
Chicken Arabian Mix Mandi comes with Arabian Mix Grill Platter. It's comes with a combination of Chicken Tikka, chicken wings, Grill Fish Tikka, Chicken BBQ Tikka and Mutton.
This was the best Mandi I ever had. It has rice cooked in Arabian style with Kaju, kishmish and fried onions sprinkled all over the rice. This combination of rice with grilled non-veg Tikka gives you a foodgasm. And also it easily serves for 4 to 5 people if you're on a very high appetite.
Service here is really good and cost is reasonable for all the items. So if you're planning to try Arabian food in this city of Nizam, then do try this place.",4,"2018-12-03 00:09:25",64,540,14

The restaurant is located close to Q-City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. The décor is simple yet beautiful. Generous staff.

"35168781","Awesome Arabian food joint ... your search for Mandi should end here for good. Calm and serene place on the 6th floor, has ample parking space as it is within gated community. Went out for family dinner menu is not huge but has something to satisfy everyone’s taste buds provided you are a non vegetarian. For starters tried the fish grill and Lebanese juicy chicken. It was one of the best fish dishes I’ve tasted in town, I’m particular about my fish, not much bones or fins, should not
Smell bad and should be cooked well, all 3 criteria was a tick with a wonderful flavour and the accompanying mayo sauce was just perfect. High standards set with first dish, expectations were only growing as we waited for Lebanese chicken , it was just juicy , cooked well and was fresh and tasted great. So a 5 on 5 for starters. Now moving to the the attraction of the day, the Mandi it was authentic Middle East preparation, with tangy spicy gravy accompaniments, ordered juicy mutton Mandi, mutton quality was above par, Mandi was great , if you are a spice lover, Mandi is not for you. Ended the day with baklawa which was usual.

We have to sit on sofas with legs crossed and food is served on short movable table placed on sofa.
People go here to have mandi, the dish that they are meant for. We too have ordered chicken stick mandi along with two other chicken starters, chicken tikka and chicken wings, of which the former was palatable.
We had mandi for the first time and were flabbergasted by the enormous size of plate and quantity of food. Five of us were unable to finish it off, rice was soft and chicken pieces were tender and rightly marinated.
The feeling of multiple people having food from same plate is amusing.
Their service deserves a special mention, they just appear when we need them and give us privacy otherwise.

They have different varieties of Mandi and the restro is designed very well with eye catching Ambience.🐪🐫🐪🐫
Taste is quite different from other places of Hyderabad where we enjoy Biryani. But yes, The Biryani tasted equally good.😊😊😊
For my surprise Veg Biryani is served with French Fries and some patties which tasted good as well.

Lebanese grill was good.",4,"2018-07-25 22:00:23",9,6,0

Place was full by the time we reached but the staff managed to give us the seating at nxt floor.Ordered half portion of mutton juicy mandi with extra piece, bbq chicken mandi and full veg mandi (😑). Loved the mutton mandi which is served with marag soup and other two gravies, mutton was soft, tender and juicy and bbq chicken was perfectly marinated and grilled.Staff needs an improvement on their service.Manager was kind enough to give us corporate discount when asked.Overall good taste of food and good place with nice relaxed ambience of arabian restaurant within that area.",4,"2018-07-07 11:33:47",14,77,3
