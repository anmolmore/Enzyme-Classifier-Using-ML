"1635511","Waste of money! Please do not order from here. The Haleem was full of bones and I had to throw it away after eating less than half. Taste-wise it wasn't anything great either. There are much better places to order haleem from. Delivery by zomato was good and it was before time. Otherwise, stay away from this place.",1,"2019-05-02 18:55:07",86,645,0
