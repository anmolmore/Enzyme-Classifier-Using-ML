"15390331","We had ordered from Amul and we will order again. We were looking for a late night binge and found Amul on Zomato. We ordered some Choco Chips (5/5) and Alphonso Mango (5/5) ice cream and loved them. Only thing is, the ice creams (although provided with dry ice) had started melting which wasn't desirable. I wish Amul can improve their packaging so that ice cream reaches intact. ",4,"2019-05-17 12:29:39",207,400,0

I am very much impressed with there style of packing the food .
The service was also good . The items were delivered on time .

"51608780","Ordered Nutty Fruity Ice Cream¬†which is mango and strawberry crazy combination and the roasted almonds which is awesome in this hot summer and the delivery boy done a great job but the packing was in plastic cover which usually delivered in Amul branding cover just saying but still i don't mind until the ice cream was good and Great Job Amul !!! Excited to have more ice creams in this hot summer.",5,"2019-04-13 21:32:39",3,6,0
"59548988","I am a regular customer when it comes to ordering from amul. I ordered ""all chocolate ice cream"" from amul. According to the description there was supposed to be perk and kitkat and hot chocolate fudge in it but there was nothing of it. It was a normal choco chips ice-cream which I could have got for 80Rs instead I paid 180Rs for it. My suggestion just order basic ice-creams from amul don't go for anything else which is costly. And when the delivery boy delivered the ice-cream it was melting. Disappointed by the service of the outlet.",1,"2019-03-31 13:15:31",2,0,1
"16616911","Have ordered from here so many times but when i got the wrong order the restaurant doesnt trust me and expects me to go through a hassle so that they ll get convinced and send me the correct item...(asked for Anjeer and got something else,sent a photo to zomato and the restaurant wants me to talk to someone else and take their number and send then photos and wait for their reply,no one has so much time and customer service shud be easier",1,"2019-03-30 23:37:47",3,18,1

"29639498","Ordered Tropical Sunrise Sundae with chocolate syrup base, choco chips and Fruit poison ice cream. Both were mind blowing. Fruit poison had exotic fruits like kiwi and strawberry and tasted really well. The tropical sundae had a cocoan and dark chocolaty after-taste. They know their stuff well and I will prefer their items over Cream stone for sure.",4,"2019-03-16 15:23:52",158,228,3

"33078084","Ordered Afghani nuts ice-cream; gotta say the quantity was more than what I expected and the amount of nuts/dry-fruits was generous. Ice cream was smooth and tasty. Would definitely order again!
Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.
Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.
Will keep ordering from Amul ! :)",5,"2018-12-08 23:29:41",7,2,0

"36670448","I had this ice cream tooty-fruity. It was so horrible. There were pieces of something that were tasteless and they put so much nuts and other bullshit that the only thing that was okay the actual ice cream I couldn't have the taste of that too. I literally puked the entire thing after having a severe stomach ache. DO NOT HAVE TOOTY-FRUITY unless it's just a scoop with no add-ons.",1,"2018-10-15 09:56:47",2,14,0

I have tried the chocolate sundae, brownie with ice cream and many basic flavours like mango,belgium chocolate,choco chip chocolate,butterscotch and strawberry.
Taste is good , I am only disappointed with the brownie its more like chocolate sponge cake . The portion size is appreciable for the price. Looking for budget ice cream , this place is great for it.",4,"2018-09-07 18:49:13",95,299,2

Pros: Pocket friendly yet high quality ice creams, Delivered with dry-ice so delivery experience was good and it did not melt, Can visit for ice cream late night, value proportion for money
Cons: Having there is not that great as place is small",5,"2018-08-26 13:13:08",22,19,0

"55623999","The staff was very ill mannered and have no respect towards customers. 6 of us went there to dine in and ordered plenty. One of our friends brought butter milk from the next store and sat along with us. He could have told politely that outside food was not allowed. But he asked him to get out in a mannerless way. We cancelled the order and walked away.
Management has to take this seriously and take action over such behaviour. Or train their staff properly.
Profits should be inversely proportional to manners and hospitality. Not the other way around.
I wouldn't suggest a visit to this place if you are not ok with this kind of treatment. ",1,"2018-08-07 01:53:49",4,1,0

"2698588","Friday Night must desserts-
Amul has an outlet near DLF CyberCity Gate 2, Gachibowli which is fully crowded on the weekends. This place is small and has less number of tables available. It is decorated with the lights and the loud music plays in the background. People love to enjoy desserts here after having the street food at DLF.
They serve a large variety of ice creams, brownies, sundae etc. We ordered Belgian Chocolate, Rajbhog and Kesar Pista ice creams cost near INR 75. All of them were delicious and mouth watering. Service was quite slow, as they had many online orders in a queue.
Overall -
A casual place to on every weekend for the desserts along with the friends.",4,"2018-07-31 15:02:36",101,332,0
