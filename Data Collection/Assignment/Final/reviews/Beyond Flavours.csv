I met two persons here named Papiya and Shuvro who are the best at their services. Food items i liked here were Basket biryani and Kodi drum sticks. Finally just loved.",5,"2019-05-18 21:54:23",2,39,0

"113364811","Well we‚Äôre new to Hyderabad . And I can for a fact say that it‚Äôs probably the best place I‚Äôve eaten a buffet at in Hyderabad period .

"4532951","My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits
Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.
I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.
The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart! ",4,"2019-05-18 14:53:36",150,2105,9

"33962016","The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.

"1662729","We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.
The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.
The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.
Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ
Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.
For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.
Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.
Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.",3,"2019-05-16 07:13:25",25,24,0

"40020422","Discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office. Walked in, and ordered some food thinking it'd be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet.
But. But, the food turned out to be a saviour. And the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. The lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food.",5,"2019-05-15 00:17:46",3,2,2

Strters : Veg : paneer tikka, veg spring roll and veg cutlet.They were lil cold but the taste wad good
Non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.Chicken was fair enuf.
Singapore Noodles,Egg salad and pasta : They were good but it was cold.
Main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer All were equally good
Biriyani: Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
Desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake 
The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow.We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full.
They could improve the above points to stand better!

"35514955","I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.
The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.
We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!",2,"2019-05-12 08:37:28",1,2,0
"39471814","I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.
1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.
Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both.

"1624523","I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more.

"36758121","This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it.

"3150106","Beyond Flavors is true to its name. This place needs no marketing or advertising whatsoever, its customers and food will soon have the city going ga-ga over their food. With decent ambience, great location, private dining option they surpassed my expectations. Liked the presentation of every single dish served. The quantity was also HUGE. One of the few restaurants which serves vegetarian food just as good (or even better) than the non vegetarian dishes.¬†
We started with some refreshing cocktails - the Kiwi green apple was without a doubt my favorite. Next up was the soup, the vegetable soup was thick and creamy with nice pieces of veggies, I preferred this over the chicken hot & sour soup. We had a bunch of appetizers & mains, however I am listing my favorites below¬†
Non vegetarian:
Fish and chips were one of the best in the city. It wasn't too oily and were crisp fillets fried to perfection. This was a favorite amongst everybody.¬†
Kodi Drumstick is a modern twist to drumsticks with rich South Indian flavors. Definitely a must try for spicy food lovers.¬†
Vegetarian:¬†
Chilli Honey Lotus Stem - You just cannot miss this dish when you visit this restaurant. it could clearly be their signature dish. Crispy tangy sweet and spicy. A mouth full of flavors.¬†
Tandoori Melt Mushroom - cheese stuffed mushroom¬†
Main Course:¬†
The Bharwan Pistawala murgh was a thick, rich, nutty gravy which went really well with tandoori breads.¬†
I loved the presentation of their basket Biryani and the fact that the serve ware is completely edible (baked in-house) is very thoughtful for the planet.¬†
The Biryani was good but definitely not the best.¬†
Their desserts need improvement and service can be quicker. The lunch buffet is definitely value for money and a hit amongst the corporates as I hear there's a waiting line during lunch hour. Kudos!",4,"2019-05-01 14:58:49",66,435,14

"43495179","Great Dine-in place
So was here for a Sunday Lunch. It is located in gachibowli. Beyond Flavours is spread with a beautiful entrance with a bar area on the right side, leading to the huge dinning area inside.
Now they have come up with lunch Buffet also.
I happend to try the regular items from the menu which was basically √† la carte menu.
Started with some soups, Tomato Tulsi ka Shorba, Thick Mushroom Soup, Tom Yum Soup.
Among these the Mushroom Soup was too good.
Tried out various mocktails from their menu, in which the Fruit Punch, pomegranate mojito and most amazing Beyond Delight are the best try outs.
Coming to starters, had an amazing variety... Kung pao chicken, telengana kodi chicken, salt and pepper mushroom, Murg Reshmi kebab, Spinach and cheese Rolls.
Main Course had all the delicious delicacies like Bharwan Pista Wala Murg, Fish Curry, Mutton tikka Masala, and Paneer Tikka Masala. Two types of Rice were also there, one was the new creation Baked Biryani which was very flavorful and the other Mutton Zafrani Pulao which was just lip smacking. For the dessert had coffee caramel pudding, which was average and sizzling Brownie.
Overall a great experience. Definitely a go to place with friends and family and enjoy the food with economical prices.

"53855566","One of the worst places ive ever visited.. They dont even serve starters for the ones who opted for buffet. They don't maintain cutlery. Food quality is also not satisfactory. One has to wait for the food so long. No proper management.",1,"2019-04-30 14:56:09",2,4,0
"31993462","Two words... Awesome Food. I specially loved their Tai Pai Chicken. It was perfectly cooked and succulent. They have a good spread compared to the price they charge for it.Everything on the spread was yummy.
Less choices in desserts though. It would have been perfect if they had kept some add on for ice creams like chocolate sauce , chocolate chips. ",4,"2019-04-30 14:02:29",28,13,1
"2807672","""Beyond Flavours"" was Beyond expectations !! The place is near the Biodiversity area, Gachibowli with a really nice ambience. They have both private dining area as well as normal seating area. As we started with the evening some really refreshing mocktails were served, my favorite has to be the guava and cilantro with a dash of chilli. The starters here are so good that I don't shy away from saying that I loved the veg starters more(I am a hard core non vegetarian, mind it) the chilli honey lotus stem is to die for üòç, then the makhmali paneer tikka...yumm !! Tandoori mushrooms. The fish and chips here are the best I have had till now !! Main course, which is not really my favorite course since all the gravy usually tastes the same...but again, here even the 2 veg gravies served were totally different and tasted delicious !! The bharwan pista Wala murgh was the best gravy among all... although I can have the subz nizami handi again !! The desserts can be improved a little but it is not that big a concern. All together it was really a great experience and I am definitely going back to this place soon, till then happy eating !!",5,"2019-04-30 11:45:11",121,883,10

"33075170","Went there this evening based on their high Zomato rating. But was utterly disappointed with the pathetic service. There were approx 20 tables and they had at max 6 persons to take order and serve them. We had to call them multiple times just to fill our water glasses. Ambience was not extraordinary, pretty basic.
And THE MUSIC!! It was soo loud and the bass was so high that we had to shout to talk to each other.
Food was good. Tom-Yum Soup, Tawa Fish Fry was really good in taste. 2 stars for food only.
But service was the spoilsport for the evening. Definitely not worth 4+ star in Zomato.",2,"2019-04-27 23:17:21",1,1,0
"99009526","Firstly no one bothered to take the order for half n hour, worst service, we had to continuously ask for water again and again.
Food was fine but the overall service experience was very bad and then with waiting for hours long for food and water they made us wait for another half n hour to get our bill.
Seriously can't believe this place has got such a good rating on Zomato.
Wont recommend to anyone",1,"2019-04-27 22:23:42",1,0,0

"34691479","The name of the place exactly defines it. There is nothing in that can be said to be rightly flavoured. Went for the buffet after Zomato ratings and it made me miss my home cooked food. The ambience is too basic, nothing wow. And food is beyond basic flavors. The paneer items were pathetic and breads were way too crispy and were served even without asking us . Variety of items is less as compared to the amount they charge. A special No for vegetarians.
And desserts too were pathetic. Gulab jamun was hard from inside. Moong dal halwa had more oil than anything else.
And the mocktail they served had too much taste of syrup. It tasted like a medicine.
A bad experience. ",2,"2019-04-25 21:12:41",88,187,0

"29180789","Awesome ambiance and courteous staffs.
We ordered a Murgh Reshmi Kebab, the best I have ever had. Juicy chicken tikka with coated fried egg white foam. It was a very engimatic combo and was too tasty. This was side dished with a flower shaped pampad.
Then we ordered Mediterranean grilled chicken spaghetti. This was served with two awesome garlic bread with a slice of grilled chicken, again with a wonderful taste.
Overall a wonderful experience.",5,"2019-04-23 23:12:17",30,112,2

"2036154","Gachibowli, Madhapur, Hitech city, Kondapur, Kothaguda locations give a competitive market for restaurants with majority IT crowd around and prime focus around quality, quantity & VFM pricing. Such a situation yet Beyond Flavours sailed the wave with its affordable pricing and decent taste. Especially on their Lunch buffets priced at 500INR serving close to 50/60 items on the spread and you can expect a decent crowd waiting even on the weekdays. While I head a lot of mixed reviews around it, I only say to compare the pricing with the decent food on the buffet. (An ala carte dish from a decent dining eatery around Gachibowli costs you a min of 200‚Çπ )
Ambience best experienced in the evenings with the incandescent lamps & minimalistic interior d√©cor accommodating 120pax including PDR‚Äôs. Except for 20% of the menu which falls at 340‚Çπ, rest all are below 300‚Çπ making it a price for two at 1000INR. Flash your corporate Id Cards and get a Flat 15% off on Dinning until 31st August.
From the food served on the house, I find the fish and chips, makhmali paneer tikka, chilli honey lotus stem, grilled veg lasagna, sabji nizami handi, basket biryani, good. Except for #OrangeLover rest, all mocktails were run-of-the-mill as their pro bartender is on leave. From desserts sizzling brownie (eggless) was good, gazar ka halwa and gulab jamun were okayish.
Overall I find this place okay in all aspects and can be recommended for corporate team lunches.
Location ‚Äì Opp Biodiversity Park, Gachibowli.

"31920790","One of the best food experiences i have had in recent times specially in main course. My recommendation from what I tried is:
Makhamali paneer - slices of paneer sandwiched with masala, skewered and finished in tandoor
Tandoori melt mushrooms - delicious stuffed mushrooms
Kodi drumsticks - drumsticks in local masalas
Fish and chips - well drained, panko crumbed fish fillets, fried to a golden goodness. This was a clear favorite on our table.
Sabji nizami handi - this was one of the rare occasions when I truly enjoyed this popular dish
Bharwan pistewala murg - rich, nutty gravy with a generous amount of sliced toasted nuts thrown in for good measure. This was great with the bread basket.
Although I haven't tried the lunch buffet, I hear it is very popular with the corporate crowd and often has a waiting. I hope to try it soon. ",4,"2019-04-22 22:46:11",160,1374,10
"38164763","Tried Chinese as well as Indian over here. The soup of this place is one of the best I have had in Hyderabad. Loved the Indian gravies as well. The noodles were a bit dry but still tasty.

"31612514","The ambience was great! And the food was beyond worst. They just have one flavour to all the dishes. Starters to desserts... Everything sucks. ",1,"2019-04-22 14:30:18",31,99,0
"2027944","Sometimes you crave amazing looking places while the other times you just want a quaint place where you can Devour your food with a few mocktails. One such place is beyond flavours in Gachibowli. It‚Äôs a pretty looking restaurant which serves super delicious food and amazing mocktails. 
Let‚Äôs first talk about the mocktails: We tried out a number if mocktails and almost all of them were delicious.We had the guava on fire, blue lagoon, fruit punch, Pomegranate mojito, orange lover  and beyond delight.  Except the blue Lagoon on the mocktails are highly recommended. The blue Lagoon was a bit to Sour for my liking. 
The pomegranate Mojito and the guava on fire were extremely refreshing.Beyond delight and the fruit punch were slightly heavy but on point in terms of flavour. Highly recommended. 
Soups:Tamatar aur Tulsi ka shorba: This was one delicious combination loved  the variation  in the regular tomato soup. The hint of Tulsi in the suit was just perfect. 
Mushroom rich cream soup: This soup is flavourful however it could have been a little thicker inconsistency.
Chicken hot and sour soup: I loved The Tangye sweet and hint of spice in this group. They were generous with the veggies and chicken pieces in the soup. 
Appetizers: 
Paneer tikka: The marination was really tasty and so was the Paneer used. The dish looked extremely colourful however I would have preferred the regular check me instead of the mail and other dipping sauces. 
Salt-and-pepper mushrooms: I was in love with this dish highly recommended simple and delicate flavours. However the dish was slightly overpowered with salt. 
Cheese spinach roll: The presentation of this  dish Was lovely but did not match with the flavours of the dish I expected a Bit more from the station it was a bit bland.
Kung Pao chicken: This dish was overall Packed with flavour. The Kung pao sauce was delicious and the chicken was cooked very well. 
Murgh Reshmi kebab: This dish looked unique and I enjoyed the flavour is it was quoted in a cloud of egg which was super fluffy and it cut like butter. The chicken was well cooked and the marination was good however the balance of salt was a little off in this dish.
Telangana Kodi roast: Frankly I expected More out of this dish. This is basically marinated and fried. I didn‚Äôt like the balance of flavours in this. There was something off in this dish. 
Tawa fish fry: This was super delicious fish the marination was amazing and the fish was not very oily. I really enjoyed the flavours.
Overall a good place and I would rate it 4.25/5 
The ambience is lovely here. A special mention of all the lights which are really fancy and look pretty. The staff is courteous and the service is good. I'll definitely visit again. ",4,"2019-04-22 01:08:45",250,1443,9
"35796269","The quantity of the food was not satisfying at all. The taste was ok ok. The taste was ok. So I would recommend this restaurant okayish. The wait time was for long time. ",3,"2019-04-21 19:19:47",12,3,0
"42306499","Well ticked off another one from the list of must visit, after so much of buzz visited here to try their food,but first let me appreciate the interiors of this place, greenery and perfect lighting. Service was good and they offer both buffet and ala carte. We opted for ala carte.
So as it was a sunny day we started with some mocktails,we ordered blue lagoon, guava on fire, orange lover, fruit punch, beyond delight, pomogranate mojito of all these I loved the beyond delight and fruit punch, beyond delight is something like chocolate milkshake which tasted heaven.
So to start with food we ordered, Tom yum soup, tomatar &Tulasi shorba, creamy mushroom soup, the consistency of the soup can be a little better but taste was good.
Moving to the starters we ordered, Telangana Kodi roast, Tawa fish fry, Paneer Tikka, Murgh reshmi kebab,cheese spinach roll,kung pao chicken,salt and pepper Mushroom.
Loved every thing about these starters, special mention to the tawa fish fry which was really soft and the white cloudy omlette of murgh reshmi kebab, the Flavours of salt and pepper Mushroom. Everything was perfect and we are already full with the starters.
Moving to the main course ordered for some butter naans, kulcha, rotis with some curries and the really have a decent menu for main course, the curries were really good and complimented the kulchas and naans.
Also ordered the kheema pulav and baked basket biryani and loved the perfect spices of kheema pulav, baked basket pulav is something like dum Biryani well a little more spices can add a flavor to this.
Moving to the desserts order their caramel pudding and sizzling brownie, the brownie was served on leaves to prevent the burning of brownie but the leaves are burning and little pieces of leaves are coming in between which spoiled the original taste of brownie. A little improvement in this is required.
Overall a perfect place to hangout with your gang. Well need to try the buffet maybe on my next visit.",4,"2019-04-21 12:09:11",34,107,40
