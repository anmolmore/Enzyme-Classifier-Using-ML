"33902052","I ordered one full chicken tawa biryani for 2 people. But the quantity I recieved was not even enough for 1 person. There was no raita or curry in the package. Just few onion rings were all I found as add-ons.
There was a small chicken leg which was not at all cooked. Stale taste was coming. When we order a full biryani, we expect 2 chicken pieces. But here the both the quantity and quality of chicken were compromised.
The rice had a different smell, not of biryani.
Very bad experience. Wouldn't order from this place again. It was a waste of money.",1,"2019-04-26 14:14:34",20,10,0

Biryani was okayish to order once, its not the Hyderabadi dum biryani what you think which is less spicy and north style.",3,"2019-03-04 15:27:09",26,22,0

Food was good.
We tried paneer chilly,punjabi paneer and tawa roti.
Chilly planner was a bit disappointed as the gravy was very much spicy and dark in colour.
The paneer quality was awesome . It was soft,tender and fresh.",4,"2018-12-02 20:10:18",12,1,2
