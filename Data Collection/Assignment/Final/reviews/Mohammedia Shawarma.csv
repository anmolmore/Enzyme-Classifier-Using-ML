"32734235","Worst shawarma i have ever tasted

"62140228","(Strong recommendation- never ever order from here) - It was the worst experience I had attempted by ordering from here. I order special chicken shwarma. The chicken was spoiled and smelling badly, and by having one bite I thrown to garbage bin. ",1,"2019-04-19 02:05:00",1,1,0
"63252789","Plz dont buy this shawarma very cheap quality of food items they used and not fresh. If ther is negative maarking i will give them -10000. And very cheap paking",1,"2019-04-06 23:53:54",1,0,0
"47677585","These guys used to be really good at making delicious falafel and regular shawarma. Over the time, the quality seems to have dropped to an extent that the food smells bad and makes you feel sick.
The wrapping paper which they use to wrap these things in, sometimes sticks to your food. If I were you, I wouldn't eat here. Save your money and skip this place!",1,"2019-03-05 12:51:52",11,5,0
"54150066","horrible, I ordered 1 special and 2 regular shawarma. we got 3 regular shawarma. Pathetic experience. I'm satisfied with the person who delivered, please let him have the credit for the delivery",1,"2019-02-15 01:03:53",5,2,0
"72629930","I ordered 2 shawarmas. But the Food was spoiled. They gave old stock. It was very hard. The Rumali rotti was sticky. My Stomach felt uncomfortable. I Vomitted. I don't trust this shop anymore. They are cheating the customers. Why do we pay money? Is this how they gibe offers and all? Online buyers are not dumbyards.",1,"2019-02-09 20:44:37",1,0,0

"57346746","Please don't order from this outlet. They are delivering late and the taste is not at all good.i just ordered one chicken shawarma. They delivered it late and the food is spoiled. Less chicken more creames and salad. not even worth of rs10",1,"2019-01-24 03:12:30",1,3,0
"154778","Unprofessional and unhygienic. Shawarma fast food shops have sprang up in every nook and corner of the city but they typically have their setup on roads. Hygiene is never considered.
Ordered rumali roti shawarma... The bread was half cooked. I will avoid this place in future. ",2,"2019-01-14 07:51:02",48,61,0
"740106","I ordered a cheese falafel wrap. The wrap had no cheese. The falafel was deep fried in oil that was quite old and I could taste it in every bite which made it quite bad. Apart from that quantity wise it was quite good, but tbh quality matters too.
Would I order again? Not really",2,"2019-01-13 23:27:30",50,99,2
"33902052","I like this place for the mayonnaise they provide. It's really tasty and thick. The chicken with salad shawarma is good here. Though they can try making the rumali roti little more softer.",3,"2019-01-10 20:35:26",20,10,0
"71217034","I have ordered shawarmas from this outlet more than a couple of times but today the shawarma which was delivered was very bad , the rumali wrap was hard and the filling had next to no chicken. never ever going to order from here again.",2,"2018-12-30 18:40:21",7,2,0

"36318477","Very poor quality food. Avoid this restaurant to save your money. Ordered Special Chicken Shawarma and something arrived like a wrap/sandwitch which was even sour in taste i.e. it was stored/rotten. ",1,"2018-11-11 03:32:51",2,9,0
"53670082","The place is more a storage room than a shawarma outlet.
Doesn't uphold the mohammedia standard.
The vegetables in the salad aren't fresh and the shawarma is packed sparingly with way too much mayo.
Supervise your shawarma if visiting",1,"2018-11-07 23:08:11",6,1,0
"52223496","Please be advised of the tasteless crap load sold as shawarma. Filled with vegetable and nothing but tons of vegetables to make sure you won't complain. Perfect for one on diet or a vegetarian as they don't use much chicken. Its just roti filled with cucumber and tomato. kudos to the chef.",1,"2018-11-05 00:03:18",3,3,0

"51862134","They cancelled my order after 30 mins of payment. What kind of bullshit is this. I am leaving Zomato for sure, I am shifting to other apps.
Very bad service by Zomato they don't even have courtesy.
