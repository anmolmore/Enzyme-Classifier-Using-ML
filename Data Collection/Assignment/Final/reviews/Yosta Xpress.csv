Located 2 stores before rolldarbar , this is a hidden gem. We ordered kitkat ice cream shake and choco banana milk shake. Kit Kat shake was amazing and thickness was just about right. Loved it! Banana milk shake though it was good, wasn't able to enjoy it as much as the former. Kit Kat shake price 140/- and milkshake 90/-.

I ordered an Oreo Vanilla Milkshake whose price did at first shocked me a little as it appeared to be a little costly for a glass of milkshake. However as my order arrived and I finally got to taste the shake, the charges were quite justified. The quality and quantity of the milkshake were incredible having a thick and creamy consistency. I could taste the Vanilla ice cream with the Oreos and the combination was truly heavenly. It was indeed one of the best milkshakes I had in Hyderabad.Â

"502158","Yosta express does give the real fruit experience. A small kiosk located along with the other food joints in front of More super market, Gachibowli. The place serves milk shakes, yogurt shakes and health boosters. 
My experiences so far have been only on the milk shakes, mainly the Sapota and Avacado (not available all the time). The shakes are quite thick but again not over done. The most fascinating aspect is no ice is added and because the fruits are stored in the freezer you get the cold nature. They do add ice cream in most of the shakes apart from sugar. 
Hygienic and well maintained place considering how small space Yosta is running in. No seating space as such so preferably orders should be take away. Pricing is very affordable a juice would not cost more than 80 rupees. 
Need to try out the other shakes especially the Custard apple and the health boosters.",4,"2015-09-14 19:41:22",30,184,0

So if you are near by Gachibowli flyover and your gluco meter is down you can have a quick break at yosta to bring back the level.
It's a small counter serving varieties of juices and shakes.
I love there banner pasted inside the counter which explain the  benefits of different fruits.
Me n my colleague ordered Black grapes juice which was very tasty and have very good health benefits, which act as antioxidant.

"141681","Yosta was my saviour for the daily dose of fresh juices and shakes when I relocated from Mumbai to Hyderabad and I have been a regular since then. The team, the owner brothers, and Bitto and Raju have been meticulous in serving me, even remembering my choice of sugarless juices. Not only me, but also my wife, who is very picky about the service, can't stop raving about Yosta.
Yosta's juices and shakes contain real fresh fruits, no added flavours. And mind it, these are very much unlike the runny, watery juices that you usually get. 
Apart from drinks, they serve sandwiches too.
My take, if you are hungry and happen to be in Gachibowli, and want to eat without hurting your tummy as well as the wallet, Yosta would be the best bet. One sandwich and a shake, and you will be more than full.
Cheers and best wishes to the team!
P.S. Yosta is accessible via FoodPanda too. So, you need not necessarily be in the vicinity you see.ðŸ˜Š",5,"2015-06-14 22:42:48",1,0,0
"280138","What could be a better way to quench your summer thirst than having chilled fruit juices. This small outlet sits in the blazing sun and churns out chilled fruit juice blended right in front of your eyes. No adulteration is their plus point, you can ask them to not add sugar and you get a glassfull of nice summer cooler.
The quantity is nice which makes it good VFM and the availability is rarely an issue here. I've tried a couple of yogurt shakes as well and they were good too.
They have standardized measured proportions so consistency is also not an issue here the only variations you might get is due to the fruit itself (though most of the times I found the fruits fresh and tasty)
I would definitely recommend this as a great hangout spot for the summers!",4,"2015-06-01 13:28:06",81,317,0

Located in front of More super market, right after Police commissioner office in Gachibowli. If it helps, this place is just beside the Rice Bowl.
This place actually serves some seriously thick shakes. The shakes are available in 2 types, yogurt based and milk based. All the shakes are not overdone to get the thickness, the fruit flavor is intact. Each gulp soothes the way in. I have tasted almost all the shakes, but favorites being Banana shake and Sapota shake.
Recently, I tasted the  Avacado shake which is also good. This is not part of their menu, available only for that day/select days.Â 
The owner of this place is very friendly person. Got to know from him, some of the fruits they use like Banana (Chakkara Keli variety) and Sapotas are imported from Guntur. All the fruits are freezed which brings in the coldness to the shake. No ice is used.

"2768132","Just came back from this outlet at gachibowli.
Those men serving there were from my state orissa. Felt homely seeing that.
Coming to food, ordered for paneer sandwich, chicken Sandwich and pineapple juice.
Paneer and chicken Sandwich were,  the stuffing ( paneer and chicken respectively) with sliced onions and capsicum along with a mayonnaise addition. It was obviously , bit cheesy, plain though not completely and good to have. Liked it. 
Chicken in chicken Sandwich could've been a boiled for some more time to avoid the thread like texture which reduces the interest to chew and eat.
When added with tomato ketchup, plainness can be reduced and we can get ourselves a tastier sandwich :-) 
Again a common problem with sandwich is that when we take a bite , the stuffings come out from the sides, which is sometimes irritating. So, they could've given a thick sandwich so that when we hold the sides firmly the bread doesn't get torn off. Or if you have a better way to serve, a better solution, it'll be most welcomed. :-) please consider .
Next, pineapple juice- I felt it was pure and desi kind of. 
Pure because it was a bit thick and they didn't filter out the skin completely. No its not a criticism but that's the way it's served in villages, which is the mark of originality or tradition , as it was before and Ofcorse which isn't unhealthy.
In truest terms , I mean, the solid residues after crushing the pineapple in mixer, were there in my drink. But wasn't bad. I liked it. Liked the thickness, which wasn't too thick to pass through food pipe nor was it like water or having zero thickness.
For Pineapple juice- 3.5
Paneer sandwich- 3.4
Chicken Sandwich- 3.2
Overally I would give 3.3
Not to be preferred if ambience is very important as it's a small outlet with some chairs in front as the only arrangement.",3,"2015-04-25 23:17:59",102,877,4
