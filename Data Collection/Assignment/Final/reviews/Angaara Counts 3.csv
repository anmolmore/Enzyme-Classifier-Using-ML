"2698588","Kebabs on Charcoal-
Ambiance-
Angaara is one of most famous restaurant having many outlets in the city specialised in Kebabs on Charcoal. Angaara has one of its outlet near Wipro Nanakramguda. Angaara is spread over a large hall area including indoor sitting with causal dining.
Food-
As Angaara is famous for its Kebabs, we placed an order for chicken kebab which was served with green pudina chutney and had 6 medium sized Kebab pieces. Chicken kebab was tasty but lesser in quantity. We also placed an order for Broasted chicken which was served with ketchup. Broasted chicken included 4 large chicken pieces which were very tasty and crunchy. Finally, we placed an order for Chicken Biryani which was very spicy and medium in quantity.
Service-
Service was average.",3,"2019-03-20 02:35:01",101,332,5

The Angara's my all-time favorite Broasted Chicken was Superb, Veg Corn Soup, Butter Chicken and Schezwan Fried Rice were good. Paneer Chilli, Baby Corn Chilli, and Chicken Drumstick were average.I would advise you to try the Broasted Chicken, Service okay and Ambiance is not up to the mark.

The seating and the ambience is average, this being a go-to place for a dinner at anytime. 
The service is rather appalling, make sure to order all the stuff together else you’ll have to wait. 
Being a vegetarian I tried the Paneer Butter Masala and Dal Fry which were quite good. Tandoori Roti and Garlic Naan were big disappointments. The starter Paneer Tikka was really yum and spicy.
