It offers a wide variety of dishes ranging from Indian, Continental, Oriental and even Caribbean. The food is prepared in a way that it is healthy, but doesn‚Äôt compromise on taste. Also, the dishes are reasonably priced. My only issue is that many dishes go out of stock very quickly.",4,"2019-05-18 15:42:01",12,82,0
"86025980","I had ordered the weight watch veg and it was awesome.. Healthy and tasty as well. Food quality was really very good. I had ordered for the second time and this weight watch forced me to write a review.. I couldn't help myself.. Fantastic.. Keep it upp.. U have raised a bar.. Do the good work always :) ",5,"2019-05-17 20:48:55",1,0,1

I feel so good ordering and eating from eat.fit bc I can see the nutritional value and no where else I have found this yet! I love that they give a mini free desert too - perfect sweet treat after a meal.",5,"2019-05-10 13:49:48",3,1,0
"55473088","Till now ordered chef's special veg thali, oat meal, parantha in super breakfast
Pros
# Calories and macro nutrients info is clear and loud
# ingredients and making is published and the order is as promissed
# taste, quality are great
Now i felt few things can be improved
# Delivery, i felt it is slow and more than half an hour. Also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well.
# Plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives
# Price and quantity ratio : I felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providing.
Eg: Oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds, oats, honey, fruits it is charged 90 rs at centers and online it is 140.¬†I strongly feel they can reduce the price of every product at least 20% so that they can get more orders and new customers to",4,"2019-05-06 12:38:39",17,2,0
"52332732","Great food. No oil, soft rotis, tasty gravy and juicy chicken. It's a little on the expensive side but absolutely the best when they have deals.",5,"2019-05-05 14:05:22",2,1,0

"27725380","Ordered chef's veg special thali from this place and it was just awesome, 3 rotis, paneer curry( which had so many paneer) , salad, dal makhani, sweet, everything was equally good and tasty. Ordered for the first time from this place and with all the discounts I paid just 61 for the food and got 50 as cashback.
I totally loved it and would definitely order again
Quality-6/5 I did feel I am eating homemade, healthy food
Quantity-5/5
Value for money-6/5
Packaging- 5/5
Delivery- 6/5
It was a good experience ordering food from this place
PS this experience is when i ordered from cult app, later on when I order using Zomato things were quite different like delivery was late, no sweet",5,"2019-05-03 16:19:04",59,40,3
"43436234","Ordered lunch from this place. The taste was good. Food wasn‚Äôt spicy or oily. packing was good and quantity was sufficient. I would prefer to order again.",4,"2019-04-30 15:52:54",12,1,0
"31287074","The food from this restaurant was lipsmacking and packed with real flavours.
Literally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering.. u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asap...!
Have u hv had this kind of feeling ? üòÉ
Service was real quick comprising both Order Acceptence and Delivery.
Suggestions:
Plz add cocktail onion with the meal
Portion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 3/4 of the brim.
Tu sum up this review I would say... Kuddos and you deserve ur brand name !!",4,"2019-04-30 10:09:42",78,416,1
"46972119","they don't deliver your food. They charge for food but may deliver only half of the order. and when contacte Zomato tell you that Restaurant no. is switched off. Strange, are they in food delivery busines or this is something else? beware",1,"2019-04-25 21:08:44",1,2,0
"302382","I ordered lunch from here and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to prepare the food and then another 15 minutes for Zomato to deliver.  Zomato was apologetic and gave some credits but I am never going to order from this restaurant. Also the food was below average. I ordered Tofu Keema roll. ",1,"2019-04-25 18:35:34",6,1,0
"1226687","Ordered a Wok tossed millets a few months back and had a major stomach upset. The quality of food seemed really bad that time. Although I tried reaching out to Zomato customer care quite a few times they ended conversations saying someone from eat.fit team will get back. Till date I haven't received any response from either Zomato or Eat.fit ",1,"2019-04-22 16:07:07",166,251,0
"77073520","Hey Guys!! I ordered Chicken biryani from eat fit and i must say this wasn't a good experience at all...The only plus point can be given for good packaging. But packaging doesn't count as we pay for good food. The biryani didn't even taste like a biryani. It was more like fried rice with chicken dumped. üò£ Had a very bad experience...",1,"2019-04-21 12:31:34",5,0,0

"13291","For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat.fit which has 450Kcal (as mentioned).
Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box. Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil. Chapatis were homely, soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad. A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier. Not sure if I would order this again, but could maybe try their salads.",3,"2019-04-18 11:28:13",117,560,0
"27595447","Why on earth would someone charge 185 rs for 3 regular sized thin chapathis and a bowl of chicken curry. Unless the buyers are fools.
Terrible pricing and quantity for the money.
2 stars just for decent taste of curry.
All those mentions of calories and stylish packaging are unnecessary if you can‚Äôt have sufficient food inside.
Oh boy, will never try üôèüèªüôèüèª

"33902052","We ordered 1 Luckhnowi chicken biryani for 130 rupees. The taste was okay. Strong smell and taste of rose water spoiled the overall experience of having biryani. But I haven't had Lucknow biryani before, so can't really judge how it exactly supposed to taste.",3,"2019-04-11 12:44:28",20,10,0
"51385400","Ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me. By bread omelette I was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate. Omelette tasted good. Bread was plain and hard. There were only two normal/medium sized roasted potato wedges. It tasted ok. Along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato. English style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. Neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. This was a major let down. There was rajma type curry which tasted ok. This whole dish was out of the way.",2,"2019-04-08 21:58:20",60,16,7

"37401226","Ordered the breakfast combo from zomato. The taste was good and simple. Feels just like home made food and healthy too. The breakfast combo had a bread/bun, omelette, grilled tomato and side(curry kinda ) for the bun. ",3,"2019-04-07 01:36:02",144,246,0
"32820208","I ordered from this place from Zomato. The amount of food was almost negligible but the price was extorbitant. I ordered anti oxidant kick and potato flakes. The juice was ordinary and hardly 150ml. The potato flakes nothing more than normal Haldiram mixture. I am definitely not ordering next time.",1,"2019-04-06 19:05:35",23,26,1

Well the packaging is surely good along with those nice quality tiny miny boxes and their concept is kinda interesting regarding the calories and stuff for the complete diet freaks.
So i was not sure if i would like their items so just went ahead and ordered one of their Chicken Keem Paratha Wrap. Its was oily and tasted ok, not bad at all. It tasted just¬† like a regular keema wrap bus.
Yes it came with sugar/ honey coated peanuts and some green chutney, am not sure how it makes up the diet fit. But yes, a nice concept though!",3,"2019-04-02 03:23:04",139,662,2
"103008692","Great, hygienic and health food. Good packing.
All the ingredients look and taste fresh. More importantly, you get what you see.
I hope they maintain the veg non veg segregation.
A little expensive.",5,"2019-04-01 13:34:07",1,0,0
"58291375","Food quality and quantity is not up to mark. A family pack of chicken biriyani comes with 430 RS and it contains only 2 pretty small pieces and rice relatively very less. No raita or salan given. Not at all worth for money.
Quality is also not very good, didn't feel anything great about , worst place to order food. Sorry however that's the reality.. Thanks.",1,"2019-03-31 21:50:30",3,0,0

"51385400","Ordered fruit pop oatmeal bowl before as well and again it's very delicious. I see that this time different type of oats(wheat based) are used and that the amount of oats is lesser compared to amount of fruits or otherwise the fruit content is higher. Like the combination of oats, sabza seeds and milk & the usage of uncommonly used fruits like pear, cranberries besides apple, dates, pomegranate.",5,"2019-03-29 18:37:16",60,16,3
"55240109","Have ordered from here multiple times but today the food wasn't up to standards. Ordered 'Chef's Special Combo for 2'. The salad and raita smelled bad. Weren't fresh. Had to throw them away. You folks have made a name, stick to its standards.",2,"2019-03-28 14:12:14",3,4,0

"51385400","Super delicious nutty dates pudding. Simple dish made with wheat, milk, natural sweetener jaggery(gud). It was topped with almonds, dates, kishmish. There was no cashew nuts as specified in menu. Else would've rated 5.
Pomegranate protect was simply amazing. One can feel raw pomegranate, coconut juice. Satisfied with quantity for both items(bought on zomato offer)",4,"2019-03-26 19:08:06",60,16,2
"51385400","Fruit pop oatmeal bowl was amazing. Surprisingly it's not what typical oatmeal bowls are. Oats, soaked sabza seeds and milk in equal proportions filled the bowl topped with pear, apple, pomegranate, dates and mint leaves. Superb taste enough for a person.
All eatfit drinks/juices are amazing and so was Guava glow. Could actually feel raw taste of pineapple and guava with little tangy lemon. The pepper was unidentifiable in juice.",5,"2019-03-25 10:48:07",60,16,2

"36295431","Really healthy and tasty food. Quantity is a bit at the lower end for the given price, hence expensive.

A wholesome meal for two, it came in a box full of 3 chapatis each, daal, chicken gravy, raita, salad, pickled carrots and besan ladoos which were obviously low on oil and sugar.
A healthy alternative to oustide food if you're working out . Enjoyed the complimentary date tea cake as well. ",4,"2019-03-23 19:53:08",140,362,2

"64900377","I strongly recommend this place for the folks who are conscious about calories. I would suggest eat.fit to look after the quantity,because I think it's very little with this price tag.

"972999","I have ordered kachori & chana chaat for home delivery from zomato. I was expecting a quality food as this was not my first order from eat.fit ( previously ordered food quality being good). As soon as I opened the box bad smell was coming, then realised it was from the chana chaat and not kachori's. The chana chaat has gone bad and was not fresh due to which kachori's were also smelling bad. I had to throw away everything. I don't think I can order again with trust on their food quality.",1,"2019-03-20 19:24:24",1,0,0
"51385400","Dates tea cake was good. I was expecting it to be gooey considering the nature of dates or some layer in between concentrating on dates. It was plain regular cake with flax seed topping making it healthier. 
Topped with chia seeds,  the Lemon tea cake was surprising as I could feel cinnamon. It was slightly oily. At first it was tasteless but then it turned out to be tastier than dates tea cake. 
These cakes are Wheat based just as described which is a good thing.Though the quantity seemed decent for the price for both cakes, I wish it could've been more just as shown in cult fit website.",3,"2019-03-20 18:59:17",60,16,8
