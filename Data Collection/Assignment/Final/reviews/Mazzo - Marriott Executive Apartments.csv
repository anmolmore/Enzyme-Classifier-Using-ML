"1738317","This intimate and cozy restaurant is located in the Gachibowli area . ¬†The service is quite good, with all servers being polite and efficient . ¬†Ambience of the place is breathtaking and perfect for having group , corporate events or a romantic evening.
This place is so good, that I've been there three times in under a month. ¬†
Pasta arabiatta is one of my favourites with the right amount of sauce and seasoning which makes it a perfect dish for all occasions. ¬†The homestyle chicken is also very delectable and mouthwatering. ¬†All the flavor is kept in while cooking and goes well with a good cocktail .
The prices are extremely reasonable compared to similar places.
A must go place to chill and relax with friends or family. ",5,"2019-05-17 16:03:04",91,493,10

"44677130","Went there for my husband's birthday.
We ordered fish and chips and Basa fillet.
In both the dishes the fish were not served fresh.
Service was not that great either as it was the busy hour and only one server was seen trying to serve everyone.
Ambience is excellent as one side of the hotel is the botanical garden and the other part is the hi-tech city. A beautiful contrast.
Food: 2
Service: 3
Ambience: 5
Will I visit the place next time ?!?! Yeah, may be for the ambience and no ""fish"" dish. :)",3,"2019-05-12 19:25:31",12,5,0
"849991","Wanted to checkout this new place and this visit we visited Mazzo and opted for A‚Äôla Carte. Overall only the Drinks, Soup and Fish and Chips were good, service was good. The value of food experience was not satisfactory and I wouldn‚Äôt visit next time.
Asian Clear Soup Chicken - Just Warm
Sweet Corn Soup Chicken - This is better than Clear Soup
Lamb Pepper Fry - Cold, Rubbery, No Sign of Pepper, Tasted like South Indian Dry Chicken Curry
Roasted Spring Chicken - Tasted Bland due to thickness of Chicken Breast
Fish and Chips - This was decent enough

"3132302","Went for my birthday dinner on Friday night here with my wife
Ambience is good. But food is very ordinary.
We ordered only 2 items, fish and chips, and sea bass fillet with vegetables. Both of them were not fresh.

"35486","This review has been long overdue and i have finally managed to get some time out to do so.
So 4 of us visited Mazzo on the 14th of Feb and chose the Veg & Non-Veg options accordingly from their menu, pre-decided. At 2500 INR plus taxes per head we expected the basics, quality service & excellent food.
Imagine our shock when we received exactly the opposite.¬†
1. The linen on the table we were seated at had cigarette holes in it.¬†
2. The livery was stained.
3. The restaurant hadn't set up yet even though it was 2130 hrs by the time we arrived.
4. Instead of being given comfortable seating, we were given plastic chairs with white wraps on them.
5. The Cream of Asparagus soup was like toilet water. So was the Avocado Chicken Corn Chowder Soup. They refused to give us extra croutons because we've already eaten too many. What else is one supposed to do when you are served such bad tasting soup?
6. The Bharwab Subz Kebab was dry like dried meat, the Grilled Buffalo Chicken was terrible smelling only - How to eat?, the Lamb Galouti was decent and the Vegetable Lumpia was oily and tiny. - All in All the appetizers were equally useless.
7. Moving onto the Main course now - For the Vegetarian Me, i was given a choice between the Anjeer Kesar Kofte and Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli. I obviously chose the latter D-uh. Big Mistake. When i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry, i was told that the halogen lamp made it so. Then why keep it under the lamp for so long? And the former you ask, it was so sweet, it was like drinking Chaasni - the sugar water from the Rasgulla or Gulab Jamun dabba.
8. Not like the Non-Vegetarians had it any better. 6 Hours Braised Lamb Shank OR Nalli Nihari OR Murgh Methi.¬†
Lamb - It was more bones than lamb and also, baby lamb Such a tiny piece that my husband had to eat another dinner after we got home.
Nalli Nihari - More like Nal ka Paani. No taste no Nihari.
Murgh Methi - WhyWhyWhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel. Roti you ask? - Please DO NOT.
9. And last but not the least, Dessert.
Vanilla Bean Pannacotta - I make better Pannacotta and i just wanted to cry. The coulis was just sugar water with some red colouring.
Kesar Malai Kulfi - This was bought from Scoops. The server told us also. The only thing on the menu that tasted fantastic. Ate 4 and went home.",1,"2019-05-10 16:28:40",32,309,0

"50985881","We wanted to have small reunion of our old colleagues and being friday it was difficult to get any quite place so we talk and send some quality time. Friend recommended Mazzo but the time we came the pool side area was full but we requested after sometime the staff arranged a place near the pool area. The ambience is very beautiful and romantic. On the 13tb floor next to pool having drinks and food with your close friends was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to all. Food was very tasty and filling. After ages I must have had so tasty and upto the mark Rogan Ghosh. I would be visiting again with my wife to this place and would like to spend some quality time. The only 1 part I would suggest as improvement will be the wait area for giving the order and receiving the food on the table...rest it was a beautiful experience.",5,"2019-05-06 18:06:43",5,23,3

It is ultimate place if you want to have romantic date with your loved one at poolside.. Basically this is rooftop place with outdoor seating arrangement on poolside with live IPL and indoor seating arrangement with some light music.loved their ambiance..
My review is based on session invite..
Soup - coconut Thai soup which was amazing..It has creamy consistency and that coconut flavor and Thai spices were enhancing it's taste to the next level..
In starter, We tried beetroot paneer Tikka which was damn good..Paneer was marinated in beetroot gravy and they barbeque it and served it with green chutney .Taste wise it was good..
Sikampuri kebab - This was show stealer dish of the day..It was stuffed with many ingredients like casher,potato, capsicum,green peas, onion, khoya, kismis and the list goes on..It was luscious..MUST TRY
Mocktails,
Mango mint - It was one of the show stealer Mocktail..The hint of mint and mango flavor was refreshing...
Apple cooler - it was sundowner Mocktail..Very refreshing..Apple chunks and mint leaves were giving fresh punch to the drink.
In main course,
Stuffed capsicum - This is one of my favorite dish from childhood but trust me nobody can beat this taste.. .. Capsicum was cooked and soft enough from outside and the consistency of stuffing was adequate.. Loved it and I would like to day plating was damn attractive..
Malai kofta - lt was presented in a big pate with small modak shape kofta with creamy and luscious gravy..Kofta was stuffed with paneer, khoya and some spices and to balance the taste gravy was little son sweet side..It lip smacking good..
In Desserts we tried hot brownie with vanilla ice cream. brownie was soft enough and sweetness was balanced..It was heavenly good .
My overall experience was amazing..chef Bhuvnesh was helpful us through out our dinning time.Mr.Nitin made our dinning experiences comfortable and memorable... I would like to mention that every staff member was so friendly and helpful too... Loved their hospitality..
I would definitely recommend this place to have a one of the best experience with food and Ambiance..",5,"2019-05-01 15:44:13",148,2104,7

Looking for a romantic dinner? I would say this is one of the best place in Hyderabad. Amazing ambience along the poolside. My review is based on the session invite.
We started our dinner with Thai coconut soup. Perfectly cooked veggies like carrot, broccoli, zucchini dipped into the coconut milk. It was very tasty.
In starters, we were served Beetroot paneer Tikka and Sikampuri kebab. Plating was very tempting. Paneer Tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it. And the kebab, it was the best Sikampuri kebab I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and moist inside.
In mocktails, they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango. Apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side. I just loved the latter one. It was very refreshing.
Then comes the main course. We had Malai kofta - modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry. Sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste. Must try with their herb paratha. We also had Stuffed capsicum - one of the famous and ultimate dish in India. If you have only curry, you may find it salty, but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven.
In dessert, I had brownie with vanilla ice cream. Brownie was nice, soft, crispy outside and moist inside.
Overall, my experience was amazing with Mazzo. Bhuvnesh - the main chef is very humble person and his suggestions were really helpful while having a dinner. I also enjoyed the service from their courteous staff.",5,"2019-04-27 14:50:16",100,1209,10

The staff was really friendly and available all time over all it was a great experience for us.
Coming to food ist was good and worth the price
As I was on a birthday occasion we got a complimentary browine from the team.

this is the best place for that.
Ambience is on point.
The view is amazing. i think its the 13th floor.
there is a pool on the outdoor section.
which has an access to the people on sundays.
My experience was really good.
the staff was very polite .
when dining in a 5 star one cannot expect much from the food on taste basis.
but i think.
by far the best i have had.
buffet spread is good. they can add more drinks though.
just one drink wont be sufficient.
but overall its worthy for a good lavish dinner.",4,"2019-04-21 11:36:38",37,142,0

They have this bad attitude as though you're blessed to be dining there, now that certainly isn't accomodating, is it ? In fact, it ruined the entire experience despite the place being amazing and food being great. I guess it really is important to keep tabs on whom you're hiring. ",2,"2019-04-19 23:07:21",3,7,0

"2620398","As the name suggests, its supposed to be a Marriott and that's what you expect. The reality is very different.
Let's start with my experience even before reaching. I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. And so I did.
I was denied reservation saying that it's really ""full"" but they finally said they can get me one table. I was happy.
It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it's own parking and valet which is real comfortable.
Now let's talk real business.
Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty. Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. I didn't understand why they had to do play so hard to get. Even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.
Ambience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. It's very mediocre.
Staff: THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them. I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. There is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.
I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me ""Andar koi nahi baithta"" (No one sits inside)
If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?
There was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.
Being a Marriott, you'd expect some decent service they said if I'm paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there. Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.
Food: There was hair in the food. Starters were okay but main course was very bad. And let me make special note of the dessert.
If I'm coming for a buffet in such a place, I'd expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. They bought kaaju kathli, Rasgulla, Some barfi among some cake etc. And no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.
Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. I've attached pictures
After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. When we tried to Express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. I'm not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.
It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad. Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here. ",1,"2019-04-10 12:31:16",144,910,2
"1514423","The ambience was really nice, rooftop view makes it for a quiet romantic outing, the staff were nice. But the food was served cold and wasn't up to to the Marriott standards.

But trust me, they have to change their attitude towards the customers. We were 6 people went there by making a prior reservation for brunch and to continue till late evening after brunch. The reservation was confirmed, and it was all good until the brunch was over. We wanted to continue after brunch to dinner and we agreed to pay whatever we consume after the brunch hours. An hour later a guy comes and tells us to leave because they‚Äôve reservations. I informed him that we made a reservation too but they denied to let us continue. However, we all agreed to leave and asked for bill. Here is the twist, the bill comes 30 mins later and there was no one to collect cash/card from us. They made us wait for more than 1.5 hours and all this while, no table was occupied. It was all EMPTY! I went to the manager and asked him if he can help us checkout, and confronted about the reservations. The manager now tells me to continue till dinner.

Brownie tasted perfect. For a moment didn't know if it was really tasty or I was just hungry, my date voted the former idea. It was delectable anyway. üòÄ
Chicken Tikka Kebab was good enough for me as a first timer. Probably the second time, I may not stop appreciating the taste of kebabs at Bawarchis-Green, Red, Gold or VIBGYOR at each of those street corners.
I was optimistic enough to ignore consequences of only I among two of us decided to have buffet. Hope against hope perhaps, the guy said that we can't share from one buffet order.

Visited this place for a rather late lunch, say somewhere around 3/4.
Ambience - Simply classic and sufficiently spacious (at least,we felt so because we were the only customers in the restaurant.) This place reeks of class & elegance from the moment you step inside the elevator. The place is brightly lit and relaxing. Though the rooftop view is breathtaking coupled with sitting by the poolside, we preferred sitting indoors.
Service - Gopal was our server for the day. Courteous and meticulous, he helped us with suggestions for dishes more suitable for our tastes. The staff overall seemed to be attentive and polite.
Food - We ordered two drinks(I can't recollect the names, sorry for that) and they arrived promptly at our table within no time. Ordered Caprese Bruschetta and Creamy Pesto Penne Pasta.
I've tried Bruschetta at other places but never savoured it the way I did here. The freshness of toppings was evident. The pasta was sufficient for two and that again, was a delight to eat. Had to rush,hence couldn't try the desserts.
Overall, dining at Mazzo is an indulgence. The prices might seem steep for some, but for the experience it provides, it is definitely worth a visit. ",5,"2019-03-13 14:46:57",33,119,3

"32509115","Mazzo, located on top of SLN Terminus, is the dining wing, for Marriott‚Äôs modern extended-stay apartment hotel.
Marriott is known for it‚Äôs hospitality, and you will experience that, here at Mazzo.
I went to Mazzo, for lunch on a sultry afternoon. The view by the pool was spectacular, and breathtaking. 
I could totally see, how this can be the most perfect date place.
I had a continental meal, and boy was it amazing! I had a few dishes out of the menu, and complements to the chef, Amit, for getting everything so right.
I had Indian Shorba and Fish n Chips for starters; Pork Chops and Spaghetti Carbonara for my main course; and a Brownie with icecream for desert.
Every dish was fantastic. But the Fish n Chips and Pork Chops blew my mind.
The fish was delicious, and the batter was perfect.
The Pork Chops were extremely juicy, and cooked to perfection. The mashed potato was oh so buttery and dreamy. And, how can I forget that demi-glace sauce. Beautiful!
The spaghetti carbonara with bacon was love.
Plating was just so Marriot! Elegant yet simple.
And, all of this, while sitting in one of the most beautiful places in the city.
A heartfelt thank you to the team at Mazzo, for putting together such a beautiful meal.",5,"2019-02-27 23:31:45",117,980,8
"31535308","Such a special night to remember when we decided to dine in for a midnight dinner at the beautiful poolside restaurant at Marriott Hotels. We had made the night special and Marriott in turn surprised us with their lip smacking dishes too. We had our hands on few cocktails namely Eye of the tiger and Bull frog which kept the mood flowing for the night.
The Chicken and Thyme pasta that night was absolutely delicious as the cheese has melted really well as could really enjoy the real taste. Hands on this was the best compared to any pasta I tried in restaurants at Hyderabad. Absolutely wonderful.
Wok tossed Hakka noodles too surprised as it lived upto the name of why it‚Äôs called a Hakka. It purely means an explosion of different flavours in a noodles and it really was. At above ‚Çπ400 both dishes really is worth the money further considering the hospitality and the ambience of the hotel.

"1294468","This is one place where one can spend a Lowsy Sunday. Mr. Nitin was courteous enough to welcome us when we reached Mazzo. The first view which attracts everyone is the pool side arrangement. As i am a hard core non vegetarian the live counters attracted me the most. The Macrail and pork were the best starters of the lot. Chef Aritra was courteous enough to come and check for the taste of food. He also ensured that my son gets to taste the non spicy foods such as Japanese noodles and Murtabak. The cocktails served were also as per expectation.
The buffet lunch was good but we all were full to taste them. Desert section attracted my son, so we had few chocolate crossant and pastries.

Service (5/5)
I worked with Nitin to host a wedding shower for my sister and brother in law, with a guest list of 30 people. Nitin was so easy to talk to and tried his best to accommodate all my requests. His staff was very courteous and even helped me when the decor team came to setup. At the party, they were attentive to all my guests and followed instructions well. Nitin even provided me with a speaker so I could play songs during the party. There are a lot of things that could stress someone out when hosting a party, but the location and the staff were not on that list. It is a genuine relief that I had Nitin and his team to help me.
Ambience (5/5)
The location is PERFECT if you want to host a party, take someone out on a date or just relax with your friends on a Friday evening after work. Good aesthetics along with attention to detail makes this place what it is - the rooftop, the pool, the bar, the lounge chairs by the pool, the lighting at night, the city views.¬†
Food (4/5)
I created the food and drinks menu for my guests with help from Nitin. Mazzo has a HUGE menu you can choose from if you're hosting a party. I for one was confused with all the choices but Nitin's suggestions were well received. Appetizers were amazing and main course was pretty good.

"29942924","Revised Review:
It was an absolute delight to be at Mazzo. The view is something worth looking forward to. It‚Äôs probably among the best views at a restaurant that you can get in Hyderabad. After a not so pleasant first encounter, I decided to give it another attempt. And boy, this time, it was definitely worth.
We were welcomed warmly and the chef greeted us and carefully noted our preferences in food and taste. Soon after we were served with Fried Papad to nibble on and Cranberry Base Mocktail to give some company. The poolside table with that view is sure to make your evening.
A little later, the Hot and sour soup arrived. It was a tad bit spicy but it sure opened up all the taste senses to enjoy the dishes coming in later.  For starters, we had Veg Manchurian and Paneer 65 served with the green chutney dip. The Veg Manchurian was a little more spicy, but tasted good anyway. And the Paneer 65 was absolute perfection, with the soft Paneer cooked in real balanced masala.
We, then got in Veg Lasagne and Veg Biryani for main course. The lasagne was cooked very differently from the ones that I had earlier. This had a very different taste, I‚Äôm not comparing in terms of better or worse, just a very different taste. And it was a delight not just to the taste buds but also to the eyes *winks*. The Biryani, as usual, was good. Accompanied with this was the Apple mint mojito which left a tingling sweet taste every time I had a sip.
The best was saved for the last. Although, we were full to the brim, I couldn‚Äôt leave the beautiful Rasmalai untouched. And of course, there‚Äôs always a separate stomach for desserts, so.¬†
Overall, I had a lovely evening with my sister, that day. And I recommend it for dates or business dinners, maybe even hangout with a friend or two, you‚Äôd have a sublime time, regardless of who you‚Äôre with.

Old Review:
Overall Rating - 3/5
Such a serene ambience, if only it was accompanied by some good food. Me and my sister dropped by this place one evening. I was struck with the beautiful view this place has at nights. We asked for the menu, a couple times, after which we finally got it. The menu has limited options and if you are looking for vegetarian items (like me), you hardly have a choice. We ordered in a Subz Shammi Kebab to start with. The staff took their own sweet time to serve it, but it was toothsome, which compensated for the delayed service (I guess). Due to lack of options for drinks, we settled for a Salted Lassi and a Hot Chocolate. I don't want to go into much depth, but well, they weren't great. Both the drinks had thin consistency. We then went ahead with the Vegetable Biryani, it was definitely appetizing along with the salan and the raita, but the quantity was less.¬†
I'm not sure if the poor service was because it was late when we arrived or some other reason. But, to be perfectly candid, I don't think I would spend the amount just to have a good view with standard food. Definitely, not worthy enough.",5,"2019-01-14 15:17:51",137,805,8

Food : 3.5/5 The starters were just OK, main course was a little better. For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case.

Ambiance : 5/5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants.
Service : 2/5 This is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.
Price :¬† 3/5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.
