"1759243","Terrific experience! Amazing place for breakfast/brunch! Loved the sour dough bread, hazelnut latte, french toast, pan cakes etc. One tiny suggestion is for you guys to serve more chocolate and blueberry sauce with the pancakes! loved the time spent here.",5,"2019-05-10 12:00:43",32,197,0

"34587495","I didn't like the food at all !! We ordered thin crust pizza quatro formagio and it was not thin crust at all with very bland taste on top of that . Then we had the tuna salad which was too bitter to eat . Couldn't even finish it ! Then we went for a very cheese pannini . Another dish we couldn't finish . The bread was too thick to eat ! overall huge disappointment for me ! ",2,"2019-05-04 21:51:36",32,10,1
"29165102","Food is amazing , had their English Lamb Panini , Butter Croissant and Elderflower Lemonade.
Ambience could be better ..
Service/staff is/are courteous..
Slightly expensive ..But definitely worth a visit for breakfast.
Their Sour Dough Breads are good too",4,"2019-05-03 13:36:01",4,5,1
"13739971","Happened to try the breakfast option here.It is a good place to have english breakfast.All the ingredients are cooked ,baked fresh..The breads are really soft.We ordered swiss Muesli..it was delicious.However,the portion served was too less for 300 bucks..It was not sufficient for even a single person.We ordered baked spinach omelette,which was fluffy and melted in mouth.I have to say ,the taste was something I would wanna return here again for..French toast served with maple syrup was also nicely made..
Taste is spot on and so is the ambience with comfy sofas.
A bit expensive due to their natural flavours and self made products.",4,"2019-04-28 17:27:30",70,169,0

"31164944","This is one of my regular hangout place. It’s a small and cosy place. The ambience is decent and it has a see through kitchen. The food served here is very hygienic. You get to choose from a variety of options. The vegetarian options are limited though. I have tried their Pasta , pizza , hummus , coffee , hot chocolate , cup cakes , gelatos and soup. The taste of every item is good. The food looks very appetizing and tastes delicious. If you are searching for some cafe in Gachibowli then do visit this place. ",4,"2019-04-20 20:56:07",5,6,2

"29007071","Bakery items in the bread section are tasty. Croissants, bagels etc. Muffins are dense in texture and the icing is overly sweet. Definitely can improve on those. Not recommended for strong coffee seekers. If you want coffee coloured sweet milk beverages, then you can give it a try. ",3,"2019-04-15 12:03:06",6,53,0
"186620","Food is really bad. I ordered aglio olio pasta, pesto veg sandwich, quesadilla, peach iced tea and broccoli sweet corn turnover starter. The taste was really bad, not even average.

"1903288","What a great find. Went for a late night snacking/coffee and the food, service, ambiance were amazing.
We ordered Basque Chicken Sandwich and Very Cheesy Panini accompanies with an Iced Latte. 
The chicken sandwich was delicious with crispy sourdough bread and juicy chicken inside. The bread tasted fresh and the sourness was accentuating the flavors. Served with crispy potato wedges and a coleslaw, the whole meal is quite filling.
The very cheesy panini was prepared with wholewheat bread and had a distinct cheese flavor to it. It could have worked with a little more spice but that doesnt meant the flavors were any less. 
Both the sandwiches were gulped down with the iced latte served in a tall glass.
Service was quick and the ambiance was pleasant with good music on play. 
Althought a bit on the pricier side, the menu offers a lot of variety and the place is recommended for their signature sandwiches prepared with their home baked bread.

"61718852","I was so glad when we shifted to our new house because it was so close to this place! This is our favourite breakfast place on a lazy day especially when we are hungover. The Eggs Benedict with salmon is my favourite. Our visit to cafe Eclat is never complete without eating the amazing french toast! Do try it and you would cherish every single bite! I hardly have pictures because as soon as the food arrives we just attack! The one I have attached was taken to make my sister jealous :)",5,"2019-04-11 15:30:24",14,5,1
"101943596","I ordered from this establishment many times in the past - and all the food was quite good - perhaps unlike anything in Hyderabad.  But today I wished to have the traditional Fish & Chips served in English and Irish pubs in the UK and America.  Theirs is Batter Dipped unlike other (sometimes more expensive) places - and when one adds vinegar and salt to the fish in lieu of the tartar sauce provided (this is really hard  to get right in India in any case)- the result was a delicious facsimile.",5,"2019-04-07 18:15:04",9,0,0

Plus great Hygiene condition maintained by the kitchen staff.I have been here for breakfast and had English paneer tikka sandwich and iced latte. The quality of bread used is really one of the best.

"7836941","I had a real craving for a chocolate and ordered Death by Chocolate cake and Quadruple Swiss Chocolate Cookie. 
Cookie was pretty awesome and would definitely recommend trying(though it's pretty small) . Death by Chocolate cake was not fresh, and had that sugary texture to it. It was really disappointing. ",2,"2019-03-24 23:53:28",4,110,0
"37846177","So I’ve been to this place with a couple of friends for breakfast, so I’d say that their bakery items are out of the world. Freshly baked and you can see the chefs preparing them through a transparent glass. 
Breakfast wasn’t great, would give it a 2/5 
They use their own recipes and sauces. 
Also, most importantly it’s a big hole to your pocket. Very expensive. So watch out ",3,"2019-03-17 23:27:45",3,8,0
"237948","Boy do I love their bakery products, especially their fresh bread. That whole wheat bread is to die for. 170 bucks, 3 times as expensive as one from old Madras baking company, but 3 times better in taste as well.
They have a nice quiet small seating area which serves fresh continental, and desserts. I loved the quattro fromaggi, as it was made from fresh sourdough bread.
The only reason they lost a star is their high pricing on pastries (400 bucks for a cheesecake for example) and average cafe latte. But am a frequent customer here nonetheless, some guilty pleasures of life. ",4,"2019-03-07 08:39:30",112,450,0

During my cousin's visit to india, we used to visit this place for a coffee after dropping their kid at play school. I would like to review about the cake which we ordered during my cousins birthday.

"518980","Went there on a Sunday evening with the intention of having just a coffee and relax - as you do in a cafe. This review is not going to be about the food taste and quality and ambiance (which is good as reviewed by numerous others) but a different thing which bothered me once I started going through the menu - how expensive the place is! I have been to swanky places in 5 star hotels, but they are expensive because they are IN 5 star hotels. This place is at an ordinary location with very ordinary ambiance. Could never figure why my coffee was 300 bucks and the cheese cake slice 400.

"343717","We ordered eggs benedict and American pancakes. Liked a lot, both of them but they should also serve hash browns with the pancakes as the pancakes are small and the portion size was less. The seats were uncomfortable. They should have provided cushions in each chair, as the seats are quite deep and it doesn't provides good back support. But, food was very nice. Highly recommended!",4,"2019-01-13 11:39:27",36,153,1
"1786203","Cafe eclat is a warm and cozy place which has quite a lot to offer for those who love dessert. The raspberry jam donut was good but the chocolate ganache tart wasn't really upto the expectation when one tart costs RS 150. Overall a good place to spend good time with friends for coffee but could be little over priced if the right item is not ordered",4,"2019-01-07 21:35:56",2,37,1
"32509115","This place is located on the Gachibowli Highway.
I loved the ambience, food and service.
Everything we ordered was delicious. It makes for an amazing breakfast/ brunch place.
We ordered a Chicken Sausage Roll, English Lamb Panini and Spanish Omelette with Hash Browns.
We also had a Roasted Pineapple Yogurt Smoothie.
The Sausage was lovely, and I loved the dressing on the salad. The meat in the panini was extremely well cooked. 
The Smoothie had a zing, and was very refreshing.
I loved Cafe Eclat, and I look forward to visit again, to try the rest of the bakery items.",5,"2019-01-06 16:24:49",117,980,0

"1049064","This place has been a favourite since it started. I remember the early days when it was building its repute. One evening, they were asking folks to try out their macaroons to get feedback. Over time, they have established themselves as an authentic place for baked items.
Their croissant is quite good. They are actually one of the few places I would trust ordering a croissant from. They also make tarts and quiches. Their pasta is quite good. Even their cinnamon roll is lovely. If you want good breads, they have a good variety, from sourdough to German rye.",5,"2018-12-24 03:02:20",31,36,0

"673455","As a compulsive dessert and bread hogger, I was logically drawn towards the menu of this place. And it didn't disappoint.
If you are looking for a doughnut, please move away from those factory line produced, dense, overtly sweet and miserly filled ones. (It's about time they dunk themselves in a pot of acid.) Eclat's doughnuts are exactly what the deep fried yet fluffy bites of joy should be. The Berliners are generously filled and are light enough not to stick to your teeth.
The New York Cheesecake is one of the best I've had in terms of texture. It's rich and flaky when the fork hits it and absolutely melts as soon as it touches your tongue. I do recommend cutting back on the cinnamon a tad bit to ensure it allows the flavours of the cheese to shine through.
The chocolate cake is decadent and comfortably ranks one among the best in the city. The key lime tart is full of flavour with the right balance of tang and sweet.
The taste of the dishes confirms the use of good quality ingredients and an understanding of the technic needed to churn out great products. Keep it up. ",4,"2018-10-10 16:32:14",10,8,0

"33905377","Update: Just wanted to make sure the cafe would know... I am reverting my rating to a 1 coz your staff's issue with the payment caused me a ton of pain now. To make a long story short.. you guys charged me twice on the same day and then charged me the same amount after almost 3days of visiting your cafe. Now thanks to that my bank decided my card has been compromised and blocked my card. My account went into negative balance you guys decided to charge me thrice overall and refund me once, my card is blocked and i am pissed. Truly a nightmare experience, all because i choose your establisment by mistake.
Old review:This place was on my bookmark list for a while and I was excited to visit it on Saturday. We ordered a mushroom quiche, a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable panini.The mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price. It was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that. The pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright. But its a whopping 500 rupees. The grilled panini is pretty much the same.I know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well. I had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price. Dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright. But it does feel bitter after you pay the bill lol",1,"2018-08-27 13:17:48",97,97,3

Chicken Broccoli Melt is basically garlic bread with a mixture of chicken, broccoli and cheese on top. The plate served to us is cold, we were told it is in fact properly cooked but broccoli tasted raw. Luckily the chicken is not raw! Bread is very hard and difficult to eat. Overall not worth ordering. 
Stuffed Bell Peppers - Tasted just ok. But loads of spinach used as stuffing and it kind of brought down the taste as a whole. 
Aglio E Olio - No complaints about this one. Tasted fine. 
Cabonara Chicken Pasta - So bland and tasteless we were not able to complete this. 
Quattro Formaggi Pizza - It is very difficult to spoil a pizza these days and even small road side establishments are churning out pizzas that taste good. So much for the authentic 4 types of european cheese used for this one but the taste is very weird and the after taste is really bad. 
Overall, very bad experience which is forcing me to give a rating below 3.",2,"2018-07-21 22:29:06",38,128,0

"222281","A simple ,comfortable yet westernized setup which I highly recommend for morning brunch or evening snacking. Its a cool place to hangout with friends or partner. It definately deserves 4.5 for the items they serve during these times of the day. 
Recommendation : 
1. Sour dough bread (if you are a real bread lover, and other different variety of breads) 
2. Eggs/Omlette meals, Pancakes are amazing if one is planning to go for breakfast/brunch. 
3. Shakes / Coffee also gives a goodie goodie feeling. 
4. Sandwiches(both veg/non-veg) be it all kinds comes under safe options and they result to a good takeaway.
5. Peruvian Grilled Chicken ( highly recommend) 
Quiche & other small bites are also nice trials.",5,"2018-07-14 14:19:25",11,51,3
"11600271","I ordered the BBQ Chicken Panini from another delivery service and they gave me a normal sandwich with soggy bread and stale chewy chicken cooked in bad oil. If this is what they call a Panini they should probably shut down and take elementary cooking classes.",1,"2018-07-08 11:46:34",54,489,2

"29075870","Had ordered in for the night. Was really excited to see chilli con carne on the menu. It's one of my fav dishes from when I had travelled. Had also ordered 2 croissant. Was disappointed with the look and tatse of the items for the price being charged. The food had no flavour at all. The croissant looked like some Patty from a local store.

"52169296","A posh cafe, not recommended for students.Visit only if its a treat. But food served it great just a little costly. The death by chocolate cake was an wonderful experience for me and also the carrot cake. I loved it. I had a white sauce based pasta too. But I am sorry I don't remember the exact name.

"2216256","This has been a good find! Almond and au chocolate croissants were buttery light and delicious. Mushroom quiche though small, was filled with umami, served with caramelised onion. Their sandwiches use their own artisanal bread which gives great taste and texture. I love that their bread, pasta, pizza base, etc is all made in-house with quality ingredients and no preservatives and artificial flavouring. This is rare, and so nice! There's also some great looking fresh breads for sale— we picked one up, wrapped in paper.
There may be room for improvement with the coffee—maybe stock some artisanal coffees from brands popping up in the country?
Overall, I'd recommend Eclat over a lot of the generic so-called cafes. People complaining about the price are better off visiting a Cafe Coffee Day. ",4,"2018-06-01 11:12:42",4,9,0
"30730348","We went for breakfast to cafe eclat on a Sunday morning. We ordered spinach omelette, belgian waffles, coffee and gelato. Everything was delicious but over priced for the quantity, especially the waffles. Overall, it's a good place with happy vibes. Just a little overpriced and the portions are small.",4,"2018-05-28 19:54:43",44,33,0

"2717132","I loved the feel of the place as soon as I entered it. Though small but it's well maintained and gives you a cosy environment. Give the bakery items it specialises in, the spread of their menu was quite elaborate and gives you good options to choose from.
The preparation is rich, fresh and gives a good after feeling once you've eaten it. I'd specifically mention the croissants that just melt in your mouth. The Almond Croissant, Pain Au Chocolat are must try. Tomato and Cheddar Cheese Croissant too is something that was different and relishing. The hot chocolate beverage too was consistent and wasn't too sweet or bitter, it was just apt.
I'd certainly go to this place repeatedly and try the other items too. But I'd recommend going to this place and having it then and there as the delivery orders don't usually come on time and thus spoil the taste of the preparation. It's best to indulge yourself in the sins at the cafe than inviting the guilt home ;)",4,"2018-05-16 22:33:04",266,1558,7
"32917034","Came here on a hectic Monday.
Service was quick. The croissants were neatly baked and the cake pretty great as well.
I liked the part where they hand make and bake all their products. One can see the kitchen area through the windows.
The cake was neat as well and the coffee great,
This place opens at 7 AM hence making it a quick stop for breakfast and closes at 10 PM so makes it a great spot at all time. 
Prices are little on the higher side but it will all be worth it.
Will come here again for the great food.",4,"2018-05-15 19:13:15",63,334,10

"49732738","Modified the rating after the second visit since there were no salads and there apple walnut Danish had more raisins than apples :( I was told that everything on their menu is out of season.
The salads here are some of the best I have eaten in Hyderabad. Unassuming place with great food, especially bakery products. Their apple walnut Danish pastry is entirely out of the world!!",3,"2018-05-11 20:53:54",11,3,0

"35151224","I really liked the ambience. The blue cushions complimented the tables with wooden finish. The glass doors added to the elegance. The place was very calm. I had the cheesecake here, it literally melted in my mouth, absolutely loved it. One downside is that the place is a bit expensive. ",4,"2018-05-10 18:59:50",14,31,2
"5552251","The first time I had something from Cafe Eclat was when we ordered Snack-boxes for a work event. Though a tad pricey, everything in that box was fresh and delicious - especially the complimentary brownie they had added.
We then went to to try out breakfast at this place. They have all the items that make a good continental breakfast, and also a variety of Omelettes. We ordered the Omelette meal, and the spinach and broccoli Omelette. We also ordered one of the pancakes for my daughter. Everything arrived fresh and hot, and tasted great. In fact, I am wondering how I let go of the Belgian waffles on their menu. The portion sizes were perfect and made for an indulgent start to the day.
The next I visited was for a midnight dessert run, and tried the Rocher Caramel - which is basically chocolate mousse encrusted in a nutty rocher, much like your Ferrero Rocher, only larger. Man, that was huge and filled me up completely, but was worth every penny. 
So yes, the place is definitely pricey, but I have to say that they serve you the price's worth in taste and quality. Great place with many options, so must try!",4,"2018-05-10 18:16:53",13,50,0
"853111","Went to this place couple of weeks back. Wasnt too hungry so thought of having some light snacks. But seeing the price of pastry at 250 + GST, i decided against it. When you add Art to your tagline, everything seem to be a bit more expensive. I am sure the pastries must be out of the world but for that nice. Not my cup of tea!
Had butter and chocolate croissant which were good and had a chocolate drink with mint which was average. 700 bucks for all this",1.5,"2018-05-03 11:44:50",89,299,0
"1311385","The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!! 
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of ""FRESH"" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing.",3,"2018-04-28 19:55:37",23,42,0
"2388974","The place is near the Gachibowli flyover. 
The ambience and decor is brilliant
I had Tiramisu here.. it was good. Though I expected espresso flavour but the taste of mocha was strong in tiramisu ..
You can make your own gelato in a jar here. Sitting arrangement is good and staff courtesy is fine.
I went there on a Wednesday evening and cafe was empty. Crowd must come on weekends I believe.
Prices are on the higher side but then again it’s one of the best dessert shop in the area. ",4,"2018-04-27 00:34:38",144,673,2

"27007960","Visited this cafe for breakfast. We got the Basque chicken sandwich and french toast with cappuccino. I must admit that the Bashe chicken sandwich was delicious. Didn't quite like to French toast as it was too sweet for my taste but it was prepared pretty well. So people with sweet tooth can go gorge on it happily. The cappuccino was good too. It wasn't one of the best coffees I had but it's definitely on that list.
The cafe is pretty looking and the staff and polite and humble as well. You can look over the kitchen as the prepare your meal. They have made the kitchen walls using glass so you can look as your food is being prepped. Very neat and tidy so hygiene isn't a problem. Definitely worth a visit.
So go check then out :)",3,"2018-04-11 11:02:38",31,190,3
