"33093114","A new drive inn located in Gachibowli, opposite to pista house.
Nice location with ample car parking and good service.
Ordered 
Missi roti ,Pudina naan ,Nizami handi from the menu.
Tried missi roti for the first time and I liked it.
Pudina naan is ok.
Nizami handi, 
a veg curry with cabbage, beans, carrot, aloo..., tastes good.
Overall worth a visit",4,"2018-08-24 10:30:38",439,1012,3
