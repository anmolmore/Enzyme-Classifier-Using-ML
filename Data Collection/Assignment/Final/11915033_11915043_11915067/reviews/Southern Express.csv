"15790472","Ordered food from Zomato. The restaurant had a high rate per dish, but they had a 50% discount active for today. We ordered a Chicken Kadai and Phulkas. The chicken Kadai had lots of small bone pieces. Although the taste was fine, but I would request the restaurant to provide boneless options. Phulkas were packed in the packet properly but the last Phulka was fully wet due to steam inside the packet. Advise the restaurant to address this issue. ",4,"2019-03-02 21:11:43",46,84,0
"58967463","I ordered chicken noodles combo. The quantity is good. But the taste is very bland. There's no salt and no good amount of spices. Even the chicken Manchuria is not good with taste except the red attractive color ðŸ¤¦",2,"2019-02-22 17:38:44",5,0,0
"36263035","Ordered food via zomato. Had ordered paneer curry combo. Not really happy with the food delivered. First of all , as per the zomato menu salad was to be served .... NO Salad came. Then came the biggest Howler. There was a CHICKEN PIECE in the paneer curry. Me being a vegetarian, it hurt my sentiments. Then tried contacting them... no one received the call. Complained on Zomato and all they could do was warn them and revert the charges. More than money was that my sentiments were hurt and the food got wasted. SO.... my advice to .... please check your food before digging into it.
Really NOT HAPPY!
Sorry to say that.",1,"2019-01-03 18:18:50",59,182,0

"52146739","Most stupid response from the restaurant southern express, firstly they dont accept orders on time and then made Zomato delivery person wait for more than 1hr in their restaurent but didnt deliver the order and they also give incorrect response if you call and they dont even answer the call if you start questioning them.
Absolutely pathetic to order.",1,"2018-03-23 14:26:47",1,13,0

"35443342","This is really WTF(What the F....)!!!. Went for lunch and ordered Fried Rice & Noodles, they didn't give the order for 25minutes. Went and asked about the order, he told: ""I didn't know that you've ordered show me the bill"". The bill was with him only the whole time. That too he didn't talk politely also, he told to take the money back if I can't wait more 15 minutes. The way of responding to the customer is worst. WTF.",1,"2017-06-06 18:12:03",4,2,0
