"2852822","Hey guys , it is me again. This time we have Hop In restraturant to review. I have ordered Hot dog and Burger and some bities food. Coming to rating, Quality of food is good in terms of hygiene and taste but I think they should try something extra to make it little more tasteful. Burger was so ordinary so I think it could be much better if cook spice it up little bit. Hot dog which I ordered was really good n I mean it. It tastes delicious and bread is so good n fluppy that you guys would love it. So, quality of good is 4 üåü from me and considering quantity so I think they deserve 4 üåü too. It is ample enough but try to make burger bigger considering price but it is ok. Hygiene n packing wise wise as I told you it is 4 üåü for me. So, overall is 4 üåü from. This is my review. See you guys again. Eat hard and party harder.",4,"2018-05-22 16:44:01",58,356,2

"197133","I ordered veg cheese burger and veg momos from this place sometime back. The size of the patty in the burger was very small as compared to the bun. The proportion of the burger was wrong and as a result, all I could taste was sweet bun. Tasted bad. The rating 3 is for the veg momos which were good.",3,"2018-05-04 10:14:28",7,3,0
"39600142","One of the worst food ordering experiences from this place. I had ordered their Special Cheese Chicken Burger. The chicken pattie was not properly cooked it seemed. It even contained a couple of small bones inside which hurt my mouth badly. Giving it 2 stars only because my flatmate likes the burgers and sandwiches from this place (he is a vegetarian). I haven't tried their vegetarian items but am unlikely to try after my awful experience.",2,"2018-04-29 17:10:49",130,148,0

"1456869","This place is indeed one of those places to order or have quick bites. We ordered Mutton Keema Burger, Grilled Chicken Burger, Sausage Salami Grilled Sandwich, Mayo Chili Chicken Hot Dog and Strawberry milkshake through swiggy. Each and every item tasted really good. I like the way they add different toppings to every item which indeed makes a difference in the taste. They were juicy, tasty and last but not the least it gives satisfaction to your tummy. The only con I think is that the items are a bit over-priced. Other then that, everything is good.",5,"2018-04-10 20:39:29",107,1132,1

"49625","One of the worst french toast ever tasted, they call it as Vanilla cinnamon french toast but it will take you another birth to figure out vanilla or cinnamon or even toast in it. Avoid this mediocre and worst outlet at all cost. Probably the worst presentation and even non-trained staff.",1,"2018-03-31 16:22:59",56,155,1
"33901255","Ordered a Spicy Chicken Grilled Sandwich with extra cheese and mayo as addons for Saturday dinner. Needless to say the loaded sandwich was too filling and rich. Taste was just awesome as it was grilled with generous amount of butter.
Total bill was of Rs 152, which was a bit on higher side. But anyways, that's not going to stop me from re-ordering from this place as it was finger-licking good. üòä",4,"2018-01-27 16:21:53",155,1799,1
"574426","The food is ok in this restaurant. It is a very affordable option for snacks and burgers when you dont want to spend so much. The burgers are a bit pricy compared to the more affordable ones in terms of quality. Burgers are good but not the best out there in this price. But the quantity is really good. It is filling.

"2733080","This place serves amazing pancakes and waffle. Me and my friends had a choco chip pancake and requested the server to add banana fruit from d top which acted as a cherry on the cake.

"3235595","Ordered for 'baked apple waffle with vanilla ice cream'
The waffles tasted good, except it had strong flavour of baking powder, or else would have rated 4.0 for the taste.
I simply love waffles and try out across all restaurants. For this restaurant, the portion and value for money is worth, with a generous amount of maple syrup and vanilla ice cream neatly packed and  diced apples were packed separately with a mild flavored sauce. 
Sharing some pics, any waffle lovers could for sure give it a shot!!!",3.5,"2017-07-20 17:17:24",50,286,2

"1296747","Got a veg burger, veg hot dog and a golden waffle. The packaging was pretty good. Burger and waffle  was okay, nothing fancy.

"2524648","I frequently order from this place and have tried many items on their menu. The burgers and waffles are amazing. I really like the white chocolate waffle and the blueberry waffle. The chicken momos are also good. The sandwiches are good but sometimes over-grilled. The shakes are nothing fancy and definitely not worth the price you pay for them. Overall, it is a good option for weekend munching and it is also not very heavy on the pocket.",4,"2017-03-09 23:55:11",39,246,0

"29826029","Ordered grilled chicken burger amd dark choco waffle from this place through food panda. The quantity was filling and packing was also nice . Sides were also packed nicely.

"164387","I would have given them a 4 but they just increased their pricing overnight (literally) after I ordered mayo chilli hot dog and choco chip pancakes yesterday. It is now around 140 bucks a hot dog. Their initial prices were very reasonable and affordable but after the hike it is not worth it anymore.
As for the food, good quality and quantity. The hot dog was not stuffed with salad but was made in the traditional mayo-mustard way which was a welcome change from the usual hot dogs we get in Hyderabad. The pancakes were soft and tasted decent enough.",3.5,"2016-10-05 21:00:54",23,178,0

"15416001","Had a nice banana pancake here. It wasn't mind blowing but considering the price I paid for it (which was very reasonable), it was well made. While the caramel was slightly of the stickier kind, the service was quite good and I didn't have to wait too long. This is obviously not a delicacy cuisine but it's a great option for when you have to pick up a quick snack on the go.",4,"2016-09-04 19:32:59",27,18,0
"912764","Seldom do you come across such affordable places with good food. I'm writing this review right after I finished having my brunch for the day with chicken sandwich and banana caramel pancake added with chocolate syrup. I chose this place just because the menu looked good and had no such hope with the flavor but was blown away with the softness and tenderness of the sandwich. Not too overwhelmed with mayonnaise, the bread was toasted to perfection and the amount just about right to leave space for the pancakes. Now I had ordered for home delivery through Swiggy and the way the pancakes were packed showed this restaurant cares about food. The caramel and bananas mixed with the perfectly cooked pancakes are the perfect rendition of continental brunch. Loved it! So if you've got a couple hundred bucks to spare for flavorsome breakfast, I'd highly recommend this place.",3.5,"2016-08-30 13:53:23",20,64,0
"132958","Caught unawares by a sudden downpour, I had to 'Hop In' here (pun intended). Tried the Veg Cheese Burger & Veg Momos - and regretted it thereafter.
Burger was laden with carrot julienne & lettuce slathered in mayonnaise & the cheese and onions were conspicuous by their absence. The veg patty seemed to be the frozen kind. Total fail on all counts.
The momos were average, not too doughy and filling was adequate. The dish as a whole was too garlic-y since the filling had garlic in it & were served with chilly garlic sauce! 
Next time around I'll remember to 'duck' into the DD outlet & not Hop In here",2,"2016-07-29 23:25:18",166,459,0

"13524","I did not expect much from this small food joint but boy how wrong I was. So thrilled to have ordered my lunch from here via Swiggy (they do not have links with Zomato delivery yet):
Sausage grilled sandwich and classic pancakes with extra blueberry toppings.
The sandwich was simply awesome, finely shredded salami infused with a lot of flavours and the filling was more than sufficient (the more the better :)) I have had pancakes at many places and this was nothing less than any of those. Fluffy, soft, perfectly cooked topped with whipped cream, maple syrup and that yummylicious blueberry sauce. Now this is a perfect lunch I guess.
P.S. the packaging was very decent, no spilling and spreading at all. Everything perfectly taken care of. ",5,"2016-07-18 16:33:14",177,1208,2

"16338076","This is a hidden gem for quick bite foodies. If you have been to Spar near by Radisson Blu in Gachibowli then only you will see it. The pancakes.. the waffles... momos.. all are good. Personal recommendation is dark chocolate waffle and lemon iced tea. Also do not forget to try the banana pancakes. The price is also pocket friendly; but as the seating arrangement is the catch here. I wish they add up and ad also, it will definitely grab crowd for the taste it serves. Loved it.. will be back often.",4.5,"2016-06-15 00:37:29",53,507,4
"31961196","This is a small joint with 4 seats in front of the Spar in SLN Terminus. They have a simple and straight menu.
This can act like a huge saviour for those who went on a shopping spree and want to get some finger food and something to quench their thirst at nominal prices.
I had a panini and a peach iced tea. The panini was good, nothing to boast about and nothing to complain. The peach iced tea was already made and kept in their refrigerator. When I asked they took it out and served it along with some ice. I would have not accepted this if it weren't for it's decent price or the urge to quench my thirst I had.
Both were good and it's a good option for quick food in the mall.",3.5,"2016-06-14 08:07:08",207,853,1

The 5 pieces chicken momos costed Rs 80 , I ordered 2 plates for take away. The parcel was nicely done. When I reached home everyone was shocked to see momos in lunch . We had couple of them after started to feel the outer coating was too oily and moment it cools the momo coating of maida was oily like dalda.
Didn't like the taste much of the filling as well.
Overall disappointment , threw away rest of them.
