We ordered a veg hakka noodle which was pathetic and one special pizza which was very average.
While ordering the pizza, the staff didn't know the toppings on the pizza.
Above all the DJ was playing all wierd songs and was very loud",2,"2019-05-18 16:35:09",19,99,1

Its big place spread across 3floors. Ambience is too good. Each floor has different ambiance. We choose to sit rooftop. DJ was keeping the atmosphere good.. But can be more good!
We had chicken n fish starters n drinks. Fish was not so good (had some odd smell), when we informed them, our dish was replaced with chickentikka which was tasty!!

Had chicken lasagna pasta which was very heavy, we couldn't finish it, it tasted good as well.
Over all, a budget free and a nice place.

"1738375","Usually don't get a chance to go out for lunch on weekdays, but finally got a chance with colleagues to do so after a client meeting. Since the meeting was in Gachibowli, we decided to try out a place not too far from IKEA.
So we landed at PourHouse7 which is located above the maruti showroom.
For appetizers we started by ordering Kung Pao chicken, spicy black pin chicken, stir fried vegetables and also order a veg spring salad. Both the chicken appetizers were excellent, the Kung Pao chicken was hot and spicy and the spicy black pin was a little sweet and sour and full of flavor. The stir fried vegetables was made of a plethora of vegetables which included mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini, baby corn and carrots.
Along with appetizers we ordered mocktails, blue sea, virgin mojito, pinacolada and PH7's special in house mocktail. Among the mocktails the one which stood out was the special in house drink.
Coming to main course, we ordered paneer butter masala, butter chicken and rotis. The butter chicken was delicious, chicken was tender, buttery and cooked perfectly. Paneer was soft and fresh.
The best dish of our lunch was the 7H special biryani. Wrapped in an omelette, the biryani was visually appealing. The rice was flavorful, chicken full of spices and this biryani was amazing.
Overall we had a fantastic time. If anyone is around gachibowli and looking for a drink and good food, this is the place to visit. ",5,"2019-04-11 15:13:12",157,492,6
"57935083","Pour House 7 is very easy to locate as it is around half a kilometre away from IKEA. It is on the fourth floor if the building.
AMBIENCE -
It gives you best of both worlds. It has rooftop seatings and an air conditioned seating. The ambience is very sassy. It is surely a party place.
FOOD -
‚Ä¢MOCKTAILS-
I tried flavoured Mojito, Virgin Mojito, PH7 special Mojito, Pina Colada and Sweet Sunrise. All the mocktails were flavourful, beautiful and refreshing. My personal favourite was Sweet Sunrise.
‚Ä¢STARTERS AND SALAD
I tried Kung Pao Chicken, Crispy Corn, Stir Fried Vegetables, Veg Spring Salad and Spicy Black Pin.
Kung Pao Chicken: The chicken was well cooked and most importantly, it wasn't bland. The spices were just right for a person like me who prefers spicy food. The dish also included honey so it tasted slightly sweet which took the dish on another level. üÜô Definitely a must try!
Spicy Black Pin: It was kinda similar to Kung pao chicken but was grilled and wasn't sweet. It tasted nice.
Crispy Corn: It was sweet and crispy. Presentation was on point. üëå
Stir Fried Vegetables: The vegetables were cooked properly and the spices were complimenting the vegetables.
Veg Spring Salad: It was very tasty and healthy. The coating of the salad was bringing the best taste of the veggies.
‚Ä¢MAIN COURSE-
I tried Chicken Alfredo Pasta, Sicilian Pizza, Paneer Tikka Masala, Naan, Butter Chicken and 7H Biryani.
Chicken Alfredo Pasta: It was creamy and absolutely delicious. The chicken was very well cooked. Loved it!
Sicilian Pizza: It was loaded with veggies and the amount of cheese was okay. I'm not a "" too much Cheese"" person so it tasted good. Also, you can ask the staff to put more cheese.
Paneer tikka masala: It was spicy and flavourful. The paneer was soft and tender. Very well made üëå
Butter Chicken: The chicken was tender and juicy. The gravy was very rich. Loved it‚ú®
Naan: Perfectly madeüëå
7H Biryani: It had lip smacking flavours. The presentation was on a whole new level.üëå It was enclosed in omelette. The chicken was flavourful and the basmati rice and tender and tasty. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
All in all: 5/5
Pour House 7 is definitely my go to place now. üôå‚ú®",5,"2019-04-11 14:51:06",37,89,8
"42169854","So this place is located near ikea above the maruti showroom, gachibowli Been to pour house 7 two days ago& was really good it's an excellent place for party lovers & foodies I had the best time the ambience where it has both indoor and roof top seating and loved the rooftop seating started off with it's delicious mocktails like mojito,pina colada,sunrise

"35541565","Good place. Didn't really like the dj music but it is better than a few other places in and around gachibowli. Ladies night a big plus to check out. Food was good. Open area so the environment isn't that great during summers",4,"2019-04-11 11:15:09",10,31,0

"9781821","Here is my Review!
LOCATION:-
Very easy to locate, it is very near to IKEA, a prominent landmark in Hyderabad. Its on the 4th floor, also rooftop option is available in the evening time.¬†
AMBIENCE :-
Once you enter the Pub, the interior will blow you away. The unique point about PH7 is the view it provides through big windows of the hustle of Gachibowli and high-rise buildings around.
FOOD :-
I tried lot many things here ! Here is the detailed review of every item:
MOCKTAILS:
-
PH7 SPECIAL MOCKTAIL- It literally holds the name! The most colorful mojito I ever came across, the flavors will tickle your taste buds!
BLUE SEA- Its so beautiful to look at! The blue shade darkens down the bottom which contains lichi cream and makes this mojito special for sweet lovers.
PINA COLADA- You might wanna skip this one, I found the flavors not complementing each other.
FLAVORED VIRGIN MOJITO - Most recommended drink for hot summers. Refreshing, minty and relaxing !
SALADS:-
STIR FRIED VEGETABLES- The main thing about the salads is its seasoning, the taste of the cooked veggies was so good. They could go a bit less on the oil though.
VEG SPRING SALAD- It gives you the authentic taste of the vegetables, the dressing of the salad and spices used makes it tasty!
MAIN:-
BUTTER PANEER & ROTI- I prefer Paneer curries to be spicy and buttery, and no doubt they nail it! Its pretty heavy, I was almost done with 2 Rotis.
SICILIAN PIZZA - The pizza was stuffed a lot with toppings, cheese was a bit less. You can mention to add more cheese to make it better. It was okay overall.
CRISPY CORN - The presentation of the dish was unique and catchy. The taste was anyway a bit different from my liking, as i prefer it salty n spicy, and not sweet. Could be my own preference. You can still try it out.
OVERALL:-
Pour House 7 is the go-to spot if you're around Gachibowli and are hunger-stuck! I would surely recommend this place. Do try out in the night-time and enjoy the rooftop :)",5,"2019-04-10 21:15:13",10,139,11

"2056986","A decent place for party and a cozy climate too. Veg manchurian was great and chicken kebabs were fine. First thing that disappoints me is there is no drought beer and the most annoying thing was the behaviour of the manager ‚ÄòAKTHAR‚Äô.

"37981430","We visited this place today. A decent rooftop place with good ambience, ipl screening, okayish food and dj. The service is a tad bit slow, giving a resemblance of a place not visited often. Though it was a weekend and strat of ipl season, the place bore a deserted look!
Dj was good and adapted according to the crowd.
We started off with Butter garlic prawns and chicken popcorn. Both of them turned out to be very oily. We further ordered Fish tikka which was okayish. Masala papad was in good quantity and tastier for a change. They wer unable to manage a bunch of hooligan crowd who were throwing beer around unable to differentiate it with champagne.

"35346089","Average ambience , average food and average experience. Not worth the 500 bucks they charged for entry as cover which was not even adjusted with the bill.

PourHouse7 is a spacious rooftop bar that offers amazing ambiance, like a bird-eye point of view, with live music and screening. They have comfortable seating arrangement according to our convenience. And the service was prompt and the staff was polite & friendly.
Coming to Mocktails:
We tried Virgin Mojito, Virgin Colada and Sweet Sunrise. The Virgin Mojito and Sweet sunrise were  really refreshing and the Virgin Colada was okay.
Appetizers:
Murgh lasooni Kali mirch tikka:
Tandoori Chicken with black pepper, cardamom & garam masala. Chicken skewers soaked in marinade, cooked in a tandoor with spices, giving it the rustic feels which were super delicious. Highly recommend.
Crispy chilli fish:
The flavour and the texture of this crispy chilli fish was really amazing.
Classic chicken spring rolls:
The rolls filled with chicken and full of veggies were deeply fried. The taste was amazing and the crispness was on point. And served with a sweet & spicy sauce dip. Must try out.
Great Nawabi pizza: 
The pizza was loaded with cheese, chicken and veggies. And the taste was great but the presentation could have been better.
Tangadi kabab:
Chicken drumsticks marinated in aromatic Indian spices and grilled to perfection which were really amazing in terms of taste.
Onion rings:
These easy onion rings are double dipped in a batter that is seasoned to perfection. The crust was crisp and the onions were tender and sweet served with hot & spicy sauce.
Main course
7H biryani: 
The biryani was enclose in egg omelette, the chicken was tender and the basmati rice was fluffy which was amazing in taste.
Pesto-rice with chicken stroganoff:
Pesto green rice is flavoured with jarred pesto and topped with fresh herbs and chicken stroganoff made with chicken breast smothered in a sour cream stroganoff sauce which was really delicious.
Dessert:
We tried Brownie with vanilla ice-cream topped with Hershey‚Äôs syrup which was a treat to our taste buds.
Overall my experience @PourHouse7 was really amazing. Thanks to the staff for offering great hospitality.",5,"2019-03-17 03:49:11",81,1138,20
"32600048","I chose this place because a friend of mine recommended and I was pretty disappointed with the sluggish service as it was not even standard.
There was just one bartender on a Friday night, which really escalated the waiting time. Service on the food section was even slower. As the fries ordered at 9pm were served at 10pm. I was extremely displeased.

It took three people from their staff one after the other to confirm what we had ordered and it was only one dish. We had to wait for 25-30 minutes for the order only to realise they had served it to somebody else. This was when there were only 5 tables occupied. The staff seemed inexperienced.
The toilet's location is just bad. Whenever somebody opens the toilet door the whole place stinks up like piss.
We just gave up on the place and left paying for the drinks that they had managed to serve.
The owners and managers really need to look into the problems. ",2,"2019-03-13 13:20:20",4,59,0

Roof-Top, Pleasant atmosphere and ‚ÄúOK‚Äù crowd. 
Preferred drinking a full bottle than sipping on shots along side ordered for Corn kernels, Chic Lollipop, Malai Broccoli as accompaniment to the alcohol and all were indeed severed on time, tasted good too. 
This place is a newbie in town (or maybe I am wrong) However, I got to meet an Old Pal who was playing on sets as the guest Dj for that night there. 
Music played was Electronic & Bollywood.

"33489176","Pour House 7 is located just above Maruthi showroom, that's pretty close to Ikea at Gachibowli.
Ambience- So, the place is really spacious with both indoor seating( club ) and a rooftop bar! Their indoor section has a simple bar set up with vibrant paintings on the wall at the entrance, cozy leather sofas in black and dim lighting. Their rooftop area is well done with brick walls, high chairs/ tables and trees planted in pots. They've a DJ set up and a big screen as well! So guys, how about beating the heat with their cocktails while enjoying the fabulous view of the city from the rooftop?
Food- I was here with my friends the other day for lunch and we tried the following,
APPETIZERS
* Tandoori malai broccoli- Broccoli are marinated in cheese & cashew paste and cooked in a tandoor! It was scrumptious. ( 4/5 )
* Crispy chapa- Fish fillets are marinated in Indian masala and deep fried to perfection! It was topped with fried curry leaves and chillies. Must try! ( 5/5 )
* Chicken nachos- Tortilla chips topped with pieces of chicken, red beans, corn and other veggies were delish you guys! Another favourite. ( 4/5 )
* Fish fingers- Fish fillets cut into strips are coated with bread crumbs and deep fried. They were so crispy from the outside and tender from the inside. It came along with french fries and mayonnaise. ( 5/5 )
* Moroccan chicken sticks- Grilled chicken skewers marinated in olive oil and other spices! They were smoky and appetizing. ( 4/5 )
* Jhinga nasheela- Prawns marinated in Indian masala and grilled! It was crispy and medium spiced. ( 3/5 )
* Bruschetta- Slices of sandwich bread are topped with veggies & cheese and baked! They were seasoned with red chilli flakes. Honestly, It wasn't even bruschetta in the first place! Give it a miss. ( 2/5 )
MAIN COURSE-
* 7H special chicken biryani- Basmati rice cooked along with pieces of chicken marinated in Indian masala! The entire dish was covered with an omelette that was topped with fried onions. It was truly unique in terms of both taste and presentation. Highly recommend the biryani! ( 5/5 )
* Spaghetti aglio e olio( veg )- Spaghetti tossed in olive oil along with black olives, garlic and chilli flakes! It was appetizing. ( 4/5 )
* Great nawabi pizza- Pizza topped with chicken tikka, veggies and mayo! Although the toppings were generous and spicy, the base of the pizza was a serious let down! It was hard. ( 3/5 )
* Alishaan chicken s/w- Pieces of chicken, lettuce and other veggies along with mayo are sandwiched between two grilled breads! Served along with fries and salad. It was just okay-ish. ( 3/5 )
DRINKS
So we tried a few mocktails( about 5 ) and honestly they were bad! The only saviour was Virgin Mojito.
The staff are polite and friendly!

We started off with Haryali paneer tikka whixh was extremely tender and juicy
The other vegetarian delicacies we had were Chilly paneer and Bhutte de kebab . Loved the kebab unexpectedly. Recommending that kebab.
Butter Garlic fish was something differently exquisite. It was topped with gravy and when you eat a piece it was crunchy. Its very tough to do that,Kudos to the chef.
Nazakhat kebab and Mutton mazedaar were kind of favourites because of their awesome taste.
For maincourse we had the 7 H Biryani. It was delicious biryani full of chicken and masala covered totally by an omelet topping.
The crispy onion rings and its special sauce were the showstoppers of the day. Totally loved it.
For desserts we had the caramelized brownie with ice cream.

Been here last weekend and tasted some of the Sig ature delicacies.
Roof-top had a beautiful ambiance and a beautiful skyline view of High Rise buildings in the surrounding.
Started off with Some exotic colourful mocktails. Mocktails tasted good but they lacked that Fizz! Informed the same to the manager who was polite to take it as a feedback. Chocotina shake was superbbbb!
Starters which I really liked were, 7 house Crispy Fish, Chicken Majestic and Paneer ke Sholay.
Fish was juicy and crispy on the outside, and tasted so good with the spices that were coated.
There was this Burj Khalifa Onion Rings appetizer, which was innovative and was best with the sauce that it came with.
They have Special Biryani in their maincourse which was worth Having.
Great Nawabi Pizza was with trying. Also,NonVeg Pasta in White sauce.
Choco Brownie with Vanilla ice Cream and Gulab Jamun with Vanilla Icecream were in the desserts.

"92998708","Today I visited this place called Pour House 7 in Gachibowli.The place has indoors as well as rooftop seating.The rooftop seating gives you a panoramic view of the area and is breezy and well lit.The indoor seating is more of like a party space which will be ideal for small to medium sized groups.Coming to the food it was really mind blowing.We tried a bunch of items and majority of them tasted great.Lets have a look at the items we tried starting from Mocktails to appetizers and main course and ending it with desserts.
Firstly we had Tandoori Malai Broccoli which literally surprised me.Who had thought Broccoli could be that tasty....It tasted amazing with a creamy taste to it.Next we had Crispy chapa which is basically crispy crump coated fried fish with curry leaves seasoning which gave it a unique flavour.This was an outstanding dish and all of us loved it.Morrocan Chicken sticks was our next item and this one was also pretty good.The chicken was slightly smoky with a good amount of spicy seasonings on top.The chicken was nice tender and juicy too.I love seafood and so I ended up ordering a Jhinga Nasheela...This tasted good but nothing extraordinary about it.It was just good that's it.We also had Chicken Nachos which was served in a big bowl with lots of cheese and salsa and the right seasoning.Loved it.We also had a Bruschetta which was average.Along with these we also ordered Aalishaan Chicken sandwich which I would say was not at all aalishaan.This was not good.It lacked the right amount of chicken in it and was overall not tasty.Next we had a Nawabi Chicken pizza and it was really good.The topping was great with lots of chicken and cheese and was true to its name but the down side of the pizza was its base.The pizza base was really hard and dry which overall brings down the dish but I still had it because of the amazing topping.We had a platter of Fish Fingers and fries and it was excellent.Both the fish fingers and the fries were good.
After devouring all these starters we could only go for two main course dishes and so we decided to go for the Special 7H Biriyani and Spaghetti Aglio-e-olio.I am in love with their biriyani.It was not like any other biriyani that I have ever tasted before.It was unique and it was excellent too.It has a completely different flavour from all the other biriyanis in Hyderabad and I could not guess what's the secret ingredient was.The spaghetti I would say was decent but was definitely not among my favourites.
Now coming to the desserts we had vanilla ice cream and Gulab Jamuns.I would say the dessert section does not provide for much choices.The Jamuna were decent.
We also had some moctails in between which were not up to the mark.They need to improve their moctails.The only one I felt was perfect was the Virgin Mojito.Other Mocktails we had were not good.We had some litchi based ones and orange based ones and also a pinacolada flavoured one.But we did not like these much.
Overall I would say that the place offers really good food and the ambience is also great.The drinks need immense improvement.Thats it folks.This was my review of the place.Hope you like it.",5,"2019-02-22 21:30:20",27,34,15

The staff doesn't know a thing about service. Tables are unclean and stick! As usual the stupid DJ is Soo loud but it got better later. Poor maintainince of the place adds to everything. I literally had to go and shout to have someone take my order. Waiter is so absent minded. Imagine not even getting a glass of water for 40mins.
The poor manager had to wait tables and supply cutlery to the required people. Some waiters were just standing there and enjoying music as if they own the place. There was this one particular guy who was soo arrogant that he started back talking and arguing. It was a really pathetic experience and I would definitely choose a different place next time.
Special mention to Dharmender, who was very attentive.
I haven't tasted much of their menu, but the white sauce penne pasta was average, I expected it to be more flavorful and have consistent creamy texture but it wasnt. The chicken wings were a little sweet and not that great if you want to have some spicy good to go with your drinks. The only thing I liked about the place was that it stocked Kalhua which was out of stock at almost all other places. The seating could be arranged better, seats weren't that comfortable and I keep hurting my knees Everytime I make a move. The music/DJ was exceptionally loud and not pleasant at all !

Hyderabadi tawa fish which was so much flavourful.Lahsuni paneer tikka was so smooth and melting in mouth.

It was drop dead gorgeous view from there and the weather was cold with chill winds so we had to put our jackets back on. But on a regular evening, the place would be warm. They have been serving us some nice cocktails and some punchy mocktails like chatpata masala. 
.
The starters were not that great and needs much improvement. They had chicken manchow soup, and coriander soup which were really bleak and the place won‚Äôt be expecting much orders on them as it‚Äôs a bar. The Hyderabadi Tawa Fish was exceptionally great and turned out to be my favourite of the night. In the vegetarian department I‚Äôll recommend Tandoori Broccoli ü•¶.

Further to the main course the Tangadi kebab was perfectly cooked juicy chicken legs. The masalas of Cashew nut chicken and chicken tikka were soo tasty. They were an amazing combination with the rotis. The place has improve a lot on a handful of starters and rest will be taken care of.
