"30991553","We went there early evening. It was calm and peaceful. Music was soft. Food was good but the main course quantity was less. Beer tasted well. Service was fast and professional . Recommend for quick dinners.",4,"2019-05-15 23:10:26",9,0,4
"39721400","Was here for a club party.
So, This place has an amazing ambience with dim Lighting, well equipped furniture & a large LCD screen & the light music just makes it perfect during a cricket match.
Well, Coming to food, I opted for a Veg buffet. The starters tasted really good specially the cheese garlic bread & ghee idly.
We had enough dishes in the main course & there were mocktails being served whenever asked, Raspberry tasted the best.
Deserts weren't that great. Vanilla scoops were just fine.
Overall, It seemed like a great place to hang out with a large crowd & also alone (Yes, for those cricket maniacs, you can just get yourself a beer & relax).
Either ways, it seemed at its best with proper space, lights, music & yaa, privacy.
I would rate:
Taste: 3.2/5 (veg buffet)
Ambience: 4/5
Value for money: 3/5",4,"2019-05-09 12:17:33",24,54,4

"15553670","Just make sure why you are going there. If food it would be a 3 rating(yes comparatively cheaper buffet in near by restaurants though) and if it drinks it would hang near 4. Their varieties in drinks get that for them. 
Place is good in ambiance but total inside so not a roof top or garden. You can enjoy the game days well than other days 
And yes a good value for your money",3,"2019-04-30 01:00:43",99,106,0
"42555879","I‚Äôm a musician and I perform at this place because the place has a positive vibe! Peaceful atmosphere. 
The most important thing, the staff is way more humble and down to earth. They greet you with a smile which is more than enough for people who are stepping in. 
Bohot hi khoobsurat jagah. Esi Jagah, jahan aap sukoon se beth sakte hain apne dosto aur family ke sath! 
FOOD : 1) Must try! Chicken white sauce pasta. Isse behtar pasta maine kahin nahi Khaaya! :) 
2) Must try all the brews! Very different and unique in taste. Beers which are imported from various countries . 
3) For a starter with your drinks, do order fried idli and crispy corn! 
Thank you . ",5,"2019-04-30 00:48:09",6,12,9

"11880351","Ordered for a Red Sauce Pasta which came sweet. Then ordered for a veg assorted pizza expecting of a better experience but failed there too. It was too bland and nowhere near to a decent pizza too.

"1044771","Today we went to this place for office party. The place seems to be strategically located near bio-diversity signal in order to cater crowd from near-by tech parks.
The place is little small and can accommodate maximum of 50-60 people during full house.

"37299866","Amazing atmosphere and beautifully designed bar! Enjoyed the IPL match while sipping on their different styled mocktail. Their mocktail called Salty Dog is worth trying if you're a fan of salted and spicy drinks! Even better if you can try peach mocktail, infused with tangy flavour and buzz of soda. Overall a great experience! ",5,"2019-04-04 00:26:12",3,17,0
"510460","The ambience was good. The service was way too slow and the staff was busy watching the cricket match on TV I guess. The food was below average. One of the server didn't inform what we have ordered for pepper chicken and later the person who took the order in the starting came and he was telling that we did not order after 15 minutes of telling the other server. Such a poor coordination and very slow service. Not at all worth the price.",1,"2019-04-02 02:13:57",90,148,0

"42927781","Food-(3.5/5) There are very limited items to order, especially in main course, there was only butter chicken. The mocktails were also just okay.
Service-(4/5) They were good, they knew their job well.
Ambience-(3.5/5) It was good, could have been more eye catchy, but it was okay. The singer sang very good songs, had the mood up ",3,"2019-03-26 01:19:09",84,182,5

"1429303","Straight to the point, the food is really good. I‚Äôve been there around 10 o‚Äô clock in the night, maybe because of that the food which was served was cold and that pretty much disappointed me! :|

The food was decent though. Not much to complain about. Service was satisfactory, while waiters were prompt, it wasn't a refined experience.
Overall, I would like to give 3.5/5,but unfortunately can't on the slider scale.

"132137","Tilt is one of the most popular places around Gachibowli for team lunches and chill out evenings. The ambiance is quirky and funky that would appeal to youngsters. Theres live music, sports screening. The window gives a n amazing view of the hitec city traffic.
We started with a mango mocktail called Mango Festival which was the best mango drink I've tasted.
Cajun spiceed Chicken was heavy on cajun spice and did not taste anything else.
Cheese Broccoli was an amazing dish. Both cheese a d Broccoli were fresh and were perfectly cooked.
The Cilantro Fish was another great starter where in meaty Basa chunks were marinated with coriander leaves a d cooked to perfection. No fish smell....that's it. It's a hit!
They have some interesting items on the menu that one wouldn't expect at a place like this.
Ghee fried idli was a surprise and was amazing! Highly aromatic d spicy idli pieces that just fill your mouth with flavours.
Peanut salad. Similar to roadside peanut chat that we get, in a fine dine form. The quantity is great and you just cant stop eating it.
In the main course, I ordered Lamb Chops. The chops were big and meaty but they could have been cooked better.
The grilled fish with rice was again an amazing dish with fresh grilled fish a d flavourful rice.
In the desserts, Cheesecake didn't impress me. They should start baking it.
However the choco lava was a stunner. Probably the best choco lava in the city.
Overall a place with great food but ambiance could have been better.",4,"2019-02-28 20:20:37",222,3012,12
"51671476","The food and ambience are average . In starters egg fish and chicken are sort of better . Corn and all other veg ingredients are not up to what you expect it to be and moreover the main coarse is the worst to have . The desserts are decent and the fruits are the best .
I would not recommend a buffet here because the money you spent here goes down the drain think before you go. The moctails they serves was the worst .",2,"2019-02-26 13:34:29",5,26,0

TILT European Bar is a unique bar in Hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers. While the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, TILT fills in the vacuum. It was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the Trappist monks. Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !
We tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper. Of these we liked the Dubbel, La Trappe Witte and the Erdinger Dunkel. They also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were Mint Mango and After Glow.
Their food menu compliments the beers very well. In appetizers we liked the Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken, Zesty Chicken Wings, Cilantro Grilled Fish, Cheese Broccoli and guess what, Spicy Fried Idly ! We were not expecting Spicy Fried Idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. We loved the Chicken Wings, they were at their juiciest best.
In the main course, we were served Grilled Fish with veggies and Lamb Chops with Rice & French fries, both the mains were great. In desserts, we had the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Choco Lava cake. While the Cheese Cake failed to impress us, the Choco Lava cake was finger licking good !
We ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of Smeets Waffle Jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of Belgian waffles, a must try !
Overall TILT European Bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food.",5,"2019-02-26 00:04:53",169,1259,10

"2717132","I went there last night with a friend and had a pretty good experience. The place is on the second floor and you can view the traffic near the Biodiversity Park junction. It's not very crowded either and thus you're able to get a good amount of attention from the staff. They are courteous and efficient and if not sure they do check and come back with the right response.
They have a good variety of Tap Beers. We initially tasted the Chambourlette, La Trappe Witte, Schuimzuiper and Erdinger Weisbier. Chambourlette is very mild, slightly fruity too, La Trappe Witte was smooth, hada flavour of some good fresh spices and no bitter after taste, Schuimzuiper was a little bitter and Erdinger Weisbier was very mild. The obvious choice for us was La Trappe Witte.
For food, we ordered Nachos, Chicken Wings and Schezwan Paneer. Nachos was okay, basically it lacked topping. It looked as if the cheese was applied using a brush and the toppings were more like a garnish. Schezwan Paneer was amazing, the Paneer too had actually soaked the taste of the spices and was wonderful. For main course we ordered Veg Hakka Noodles, which was again prepared well and the noodles too were quite light.
The ambiance of this place is okay, the music is at the right volume and doesn't make you yell to talk. The place however is very dimly lit that your eyes strain while reading the menu as well. But overall a fairly good place to hangout with friends and quench your thirst.",4,"2019-01-13 13:18:53",266,1558,2

Went here on a Saturday evening for a couple of drinks and this place didn‚Äôt disappoint.
The place is a dimly lit bar scene overlooking the Biodiversity park signal, not crowded when we went there. We got ourselves into a table with good view of the city.
We tried Weissbeer and Mango Tango mocktail. The beer was a wheat beer, which has similar taste of a draught beer you usually get but it was different in a good way.Mocktail  was pulpy and sweet. Overall Drinks were üëç
To go along with the drinks we ordered charcoal spiced chicken and a folded cheese omelette. The chicken starter was good with perfect amount of spice perfectly burnt to get that charcoal feel. The cheese omelette was just good with little cheese as my expectations were high. Overall Food was good.
The service was quick and prompt(maybe due to less crowd when we went) and no issues there.

Main course:
Mixed veg curry & butter nan are simply awesome

"35733175","They claim to be a European bar who serves continental cuisine. 
Went here with my pals.
We ordered Peri- Peri Chicken pizza and Assorted Pizza.
Service: The waiters were courteous and gave a good suggestion on what to order and helped while splitting the bill as well.
The service wasn‚Äôt the quickest with around 6-8 people in the house.
Good parking available here.
Food: The pizzas were pretty mediocre. I liked the cheese quality and the toppings were in generous amount. We asked for a medium crust and the crust was a bit stiff. 
Peri peri chicken was pretty good as the flavor was indulging.
The pizzas were missing the wow factor and wasn‚Äôt really specially.
My friends ordered pastas and wings.
Wings were pretty good and the pastas were less in quantity and wasn‚Äôt too good.
Ambience: It has dim low light and calm ambience with a street view and a music üéµ. Really liked the ambience and the decor as well. The tables were typically made out of moulded tin and gave a different feel and look.
Worth a shot with Zomato Gold

Perfect place for Belgian Beer!!
I visited this place for Sunday Drunch(as they say it.. Breakfast+lunch+drinks).
It costs for Rs1000 per person inclusive of taxes which includes welcome drink, soup, starters, main course, dessert and 2 tap beer of your choice.
I loved their hospitality.. For welcome drink they asked our choice and prepared it fresh.
In soup they had Hot and sour which was yummy.
In starters they provided 6-7 differnt varieties which included crispy corn, paneer tikka, garlic bread etc.
Coming to the main course they had limited menu with Dal Fry, Dal Makhani, Mix veg, Paneer korma, Naan, chapati, curd, fryums and 3 kinds of salad.
They also cooked white sause paste just for us!!
In Desserts, they had walnut cake, cutfruits, gulab jamun, shahi tukda, icecream and chocolava cake.
Drinks we asked for was Belgian Kriek, Erdinger dunkel and Schzuimzuiper.
Desserts were kind of okay.. so my suggestion is to make them better.. Because it is the last part of the meal so everyone wants it perfect.",4,"2018-11-24 14:14:44",49,48,1
"36167527","TILT BAR or EUROPEAN BAR?¬†
I was surprised to hear of Belgian beers being served in here. They are served nowhere else across India.
From Bitter to Spicy Sweet, the options in imported beers are available in heaps. La Trappe Trappist is one of the most recommended beers in here endured through 600 years old history of Monks brewing it.
For those who like it sweet, you should try Belgian Kriek. Taste is perfectly balanced with rich sweetness giving it a fresh finish without the bitter aftertaste.
No beer belly!
Beer hunters, this is the right place to rejoice if you are after some exotic beer.
Must try bottle beers!

I'll let you in a little secret - ASK FOR THE DESSERT OF DRINKS (Smeets Waffle Jenever Shot) AND DON'T YOU MISS!
Mocktail:
After glow - An amalgamation of fresh fruits mixed with mint and topped with litchi grape juices.
Starters I'd recommend:
Chicken Wings, Stuffed mushrooms and Cheese broccoli
Mains:
Honey glazed lamb chops served with fries and rice. The rice flavour should be enhanced with an increase in quantity.¬†
Desserts:
Blueberry cheesecake. It stands out from the rest I have had at other places.
The staff is amicable and polite. Swift service provided.
Live music available as well. Music system needs to be improved as the audio quality of vocalist sounds completely distorted.instagram.com",5,"2018-11-20 04:10:08",104,2653,8
"35404442","Hats Off to Tilt Republic Bar- The only Europeon Bar in Hyderabad for having such huge array of Beers from different parts of the World.
The Food, ambiance, service is exceptionally good but what really stands out is their beers.
When I say Food is good- in elaboration I mean from starters to main course to desserts everything is oh - so Delicious!
The liquor section Of Tilt is hands down the most rare one, I say this cause of the beers they offer. I am not a beer person but here the beers are like nothing I've had before.
The beers are imported from different parts of the world and specially from those areas cause you wouldn't get the taste elsewhere.

"15784675","Man I unabashedly love Tilt. It's a unique spot amongst all the bars in Hyderabad. What sets it apart is both the beer and the service. Order the egg Manchuria without fail. The cooks are so good at making it now that you won't find a better version anywhere else in town.
The food tends to be on the spicier side, so if you don't want that do remember to tell you waiter during your order if you prefer it otherwise. This even applies to the pastas and pizzas. ",5,"2018-11-17 20:54:10",3,2,0
"46383732","Lovely European Bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer (No exaggeration)
Most of the drinks they have are imported from Europe and are supposedly not found any where else across India.
They also serve Trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
And they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and won't give you a beer belly
Everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and I can vouch for that!!!! They're pricey but worth it!!!

Miss spicy - They mean it when they say spicy
Barbar blond (bottled)
Jenever shots (Pronounced yenever) (20% alcohol)
A type of Dutch Gin produced only in Europe with juniper flavour
These were absolutely amazing
The smoothest shots I've ever had
Smeets bessen Jenever - fruity gin with a sweet base
Citroen Jenever- Citrus flavoured shots with a tangy, zesty taste
Wafel Jenever- Hands down the best shot I've had. Ever.
Tastes like waffle syrup. Notes of caramel and pop corn. Sweet, smooth and simply sublime
Project 51- Brandy cocktail with notes of cinnamon and spicy jalapenos
Mango mint mocktail- Super sweet mango flavoured drink with a mildly minty taste
Food
Food was pretty good. We tried
Lasooni Murgh
Lamb chops - Tender and well cooked
Fries
Cheese broccoli- creamy cheesy broccoli
Florentine saute mushrooms
Chickpea corn masala - Good stuff to munch on while having drinks. Had alot of Peanuts.
Cilantro grilled fish- Tasted pretty Indian
Grilled fish with rice - Recommended
Saucy chest nuts
Chilli garlic prawns - Not very garlicky or spicy
Veg assorted pizza- Pretty good for a bar
Choco lava cake

Excellent choice in Beers, probably amongst the best in Hyderabad.
Sober ambiance and good music
Wonderful mix of crowd and some okay dishes  served up.
We tried the Egg Manchuria was pretty unique and then it was the Spicy Fried Idli was off beat
The Chicken tikka was standard
A little spicy on your pocket, but what the heck a few beers don‚Äôt harm..
Although the service could have been a little more prompt.

Even if you are with friends and don't want to miss out an important match this is a very nice place for good food, good company and the Indian team on a large screen :P. The staff is very very good (one of the best) .For the two of us they found a cosy corner where we would get some quietness yet not miss the match.When we were undecided about what to order, one of them politely suggested a Fish dish and that turned out to be oh so tasty! Cilantro fish is a must try here. I could have easily had another plate.The softness..the perfect marination..the taste of coriander...i loved it.Then i ordered the Non veg platter and I had wished i had just taken another suggestion :(. I didn't like prawn tempura at all.Pepper chicken,Soya chilli lamb and sesame fried fish were okayish.
For drinks again we turned to the waiter and he was again bang on with his choices.He got me a Belgian Kriek which is white beer based drink with the blend of cherry juice.I loved the tanginess followed by rich sweetness that lingers on in the mouth. My friend tried Erginder Dunkel - this is a wheat beer with delicate roasting aromas.I took a sip and liked it but i liked mine better.:P. Then came the best part of our dinner - the choco lava cake! The ice cream served in a seperate bowl and the brownie filled with chocolate syrup which oozes out when you cut it.Complete foodgasm!

Beers with fancy names and glasses was an attraction but that was the only point of attraction and the taste was a big let down. They don't¬†have an in-house brewery but beers are imported as they claim and very costly too. In comparison¬†to it, there are a lot of places to try in-house¬†brewed beers like OTM brewery etc.
Even their food menu is so limited and we tried their¬†chicken pizza and it was one of the worst tasting pizza I had in a long time, just chicken pieces and no other topping at all at 450 Bucks. Similar experience with fish and chips, the batter was running away from the fish and it was over fried and was more or less feels like eating chips then fish.
Really a disappointing experience and more disappointing as I went with high hopes. I don't recommend this to anyone because it's not even cheap to recommend to those who don't want to spend much.",3,"2018-09-13 11:46:42",29,45,2

They have a good range of beers in their liquor menu, but only 3-4 cocktails which was disappointing. We took a dinner package with selection of starters, main course and unlimited drinks. The food was ok, nothing great to write about.
One thing that was very good, was the service, though we had paid for a gselecwted menu, they served at least 2-3 additional items in the starters and main course.

They have different choices of house made beers which you might opt for..ummm ...!! So why not 5 stars..?
1) service was really slow and the server did not seem happy to serve me attal like the and his behavior attitude was not appropriate may be bcos i did not order Drinks.. but thn duh ... I wanted to eat tht day and not drink ...plus the preparation time was too long it took alot of time for just my 2 dishes to arrive.
2) when I saw pictures of the ambience i was expecting too much like a huge space lot of lightings then but when i reached there it seemed smaller and darker than the photos soo it could not reach upto my expectations and I felt disappointed thats when my mood started fumbling..
