"35360087","Hello everyone ! We visited this place a few days back and tried their buffet . We were not happy with the quality of food served. The variation was good enough. There were 2-3 veg as well as non veg starters. The main course also had 2 veg and non veg dishes each . But the taste was not at all satisfying. We expect this place will improve in future ! 😊

"6416581","Ordered dragon chicken - 3/5 .sweet in Taste. And chicken pieces are hard to chew
Paneer 65 and paneer majestic are good in taste but softness of paneer is underdone
Rotis and butternans are very good here
Mughlai chicken - not so spicy but tasted good
Chicken fry piece biryani - totally disappointed as the chicken was fried too much and biryani rice is okay in taste
Sides are good
Ambience is quiet bright and friendly
Staffa nd service are good
Price s of dishes is reasonable",3,"2019-03-19 17:06:35",59,117,0
"50071238","Went for a lunch buffet a little while ago and found the place to be moderate.
Food here was good, only hoping for better choices.
I understand that providing buffet becomes a tedious task when everything has to be covered up under one roof so not complaining much.
Ambience wise the place doesn't have much to offer. But the staff was the sweetest.
There was this lady whose name I can't recall but she when I asked if I can get some gulab jamuns even after it was over, she made them especially for me and delivered on table.
That gesture made me like the restaurant better.
PS. They don't really serve on banana leaves. 😜",4,"2019-03-11 03:22:30",19,53,0

I had carrot halwa from here.Really it's superb.Quantity also they have given more compared to other restaurants. Reasonable price they are charging for carrot halwa. I adicted to this recipe.

Have been to this place twice, still think it's a decent place to have buffet at this affordable price.
Ambience- (3.5/4) It has a typical buffet type ambience with ample space between the tables to have food.
Food- (4/5) All the items are very decent, and has quite a lot of varieties of food to choose from.
Service- It has offer both in little app and nearbuy, and the process is very smooth out here. Staff are very swift in changing your plates.

For Veggie people's, I would recommend not to go this restaurant as they don't have items in Paneer and Mushroom in Veg. Apart from this, they had dishes like Egg Burji, Egg Curry, rajma masala, plain rice(not even fried rice), Bhendi fry, etc. Such dishes gave me a feeling that I am dining in a roadside dhaba/tapri. Coconut Barfi, Ice cream was not at all special and seemed to be of low quality, The Pastries tasted as if they are preserved since many days.

My son had a wonderful time and liked that he could order special food and the chef would make it so he could eat it. If you wouldn’t mind telling me how you prepared the fish, I would like to try making some for him at home, since he enjoyed it so much.He said that he wanted to have his birthday party at here!
My son and my mom enjoyed their desserts as well. Thank you also for having the special Jamoon for my son. I tried the sea foods and prawns  was delicious! 
Sea foods & Soups was amazing. Buffet was mind blowing 
Once again THANK YOU SO MUCH for everything! We had a great time, and you and your staff helped to make it that way! We will be back for my son's birthday! I’ll be sure to let you know in advance before we come again.

"4743521","This outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the Kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd.
The ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space. It was well lit but could really deck up a few notches. It was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant.
Upon arrival, were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation. We were asked if we are here for buffet. The restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet. I had a look at the menu and it didn't interest me.
The manager at this place was a nice fellow. Who carefully took our order of dragon chicken, punjabi chicken curry, and garlic naan. After a fair bit of waiting time, we're served with dragon chicken.
I would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry, so that the flavours stick to the chicken. It was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation.
The servers need to be taught a little bit about serving. They were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers.
Then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan. Simply put, it was a disaster. The curry was as bland as it could be. Most restaurants in this part of India assume that all dishes of Punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief. We could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own. It was just sitting there doing nothing. Neither it was spicy, not it was tangy. It was going nowhere.
The problem here doesn't lie with the chefs. It lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do. They say they are multi cuisine, but multi cuisine doesn't mean, you can make disaster dishes and pass them off. I am not a fan of multi cuisine. When you have such a title, you should at least try to make it work for you. The restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant North Indian population or the traditional South Indian population.
One thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their Buffet menu. They tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion.
Had the restaurant, been a traditional southern one, I would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content.
The restaurant needs to find its footing. The owners need to decide which way they want to go. Maybe hire some traditional North Indian guys for North cuisine.

"44779283","Good ambience.good spread, buffet for dinner yesterday night.Highly dissapointed about the vegetarian curries which were rottened, 2 out of three were rottened. The triple pudding in the deserts with rottened fruits was pathetic. Overall vegetarian food for the buffet was ignored by the restaurant. Pls do takecare #bananaleaf, don't dissapoint your customers.",2,"2018-06-10 09:41:31",1,3,0

"38720807","Approach to the hotel could have been better (on the top floor of an old building with smelly ground floor), location could have been better (not very visible from the outside), lift could have been better (pretty old lift, not sure if it passes safety norms), ambience inside the restuarant could have been better (doesnot give you a good vibe)! Thats about the appearance and appeal. Spread was decent for a discounted price of 400 per person inclusive of all taxes, food was ok as well. I could see a lot of smiling faces (familes) and that sums it all. If food is good, then nothing else should matter I guess.",3,"2018-06-01 16:07:19",24,8,0
