"1462833","We have ordered chicken maximus but I suppose we have received chicken tikka & keema pizza. The pizza was delicious, really tasty but the oil content was high. I am not sure if the pizza was baked or fried. This is the first time I had pizza which was oily. Overall the pizza was really good in taste, but if the oil content is reduced it will be a hit!!",3,"2019-05-19 00:00:03",2,1,0
"38303309","I placed an order for Mac n cheese with chicken sausage and the order cost me 130 bucks. And in the pic, the order looked really nice and the quality also seemed good. Firstly, the order was delivered after an hour or so. Secondly, what was more disappointing was the fact that the quantity was not even enough to get the taste properly. I know it might sound like and exaggeration but trust me that is exactly how it was. I am really disappointed.",1,"2019-05-17 23:27:22",2,21,0

"51804252","This is the worst delivery system experienced personally. Previously, the pizzas were ordered by me from here. Ovenstory has mentioned that they would offer 50% discount on their pizza and when we don't receive the order in time, they add that amount as the credits, so that when again we try to order the same items, that coupon cannot be used so ultimately we don't get any offer as mentioned by Ovenstory and we need to pay the full amount. This is the worst service provided by any delivery service to me. Thanks a lot for letting me start the day in this manner.",1,"2019-05-05 14:02:48",1,2,0
"16100018","While reviewing a delivered Pizza there are multiple things to keep in mind. Firstly, the packaging was intelligent, the whole pizza was very carefully protected. It saddens me to find the toppings and cheese mixed with the cardboard. The toppings in my Maharaja Veg Pizza were a perfect blend of my favorite Paneer Tikka, bellpeppers, Olives and Onion. The toppings were generously spread across the whole Pizza with some spices, which might not to be advised for someone expecting an authentic experience. I on the other hand love the spiced toppings with some chilly-flakes and oregano. I was little underwhelmed with the base which was hanging at center (which is a sign of a good pizza) but lacked texture at the corner. Overall a really good Pizza for which I will give a 8.5 out of 10.",4,"2019-05-02 20:01:48",78,510,0

"60984746","Heard a Lot about Oven Story Pizzas, Finally realised why. 
Ordered Classic Margherita (11 Inch)WRBASE : El Classico Cheese (Regular Mozzarella) via Zomato App to just try out. Which wasn't delivered in promised time and was a little cold. However got a apology message from OvenStory with credits for delayed delivery as per their delivery policy.
The sauces were flavourful with well cooked bread. Base was little more than thin crust with use of butter below it. The amount of cheese was well taken care off much more than any other pizza brand.
Felt as if the price is higher for 11 Inch pizza with limited offers. Would look forward for any offer like 1+1 or related.
Still worth it to try at-least once.

"54372212","This Chicken delight pizza has chicken chunks and chicken tikka in a different way topped on the pizza added with chilly salt and pepper.This pizza can be eaten by 6people who are hungry and it's costing 400rs or else 5 but not more than that.The base can still be improved and it's good with tomato sausage I guess.The packaging of this box came too hot and delivered it on time and it's very hot and we can also add extra toppings according to our taste.One more I ate here is chicken lasagne which is a layer of cheese
and inside this layers chicken chunks are wrapped properly with equal amount of chicken pieces salt pepper and it is very cheesy and they also given garlic bread which is avg and little oily too and no other brand has given bread with lasagne and it cheese lovers will definitely love it so obviously you people will thank me after eating this food item and it's costing around

To top off their world class careless service, the food was lukewarm and the cheese was all crusted. The pizza slided towards one side of the box. Lets not get started about the chicken toppings on top of the pizza. If one is paying paying a premium amount 520 bucks for a 9'inch pizza, it is an obvious expectation that there should be generous usage of chicken on top of a 'Chicken Pizza', and not 6 pieces of half cooked chicken sausages. Most probably this is the last time i ordered from Ovenstory. The proof of horror that unfolded in the name of fresh chicken pizza when hungry, has been attached to this review, please have a look at it before you make your mind up to go through the tragedy they they'll serve you.

"66847813","I did not like the food much as it had an off taste to it. The pizza was crispy and sad and it was a pain to chew it. The cheese was minimum compared to the cheese put in other restaurants. However, there was an overflow of cheese in mac n cheese which made it taste even more weird. The topping on the pizza was okay but it was spoiled due to the burnt taste of the pizza hut.
I would not order it the second time because it did not really impress me as much as I thought it could. I am sure nobody loves a pizza that hard that it can be almost passed as a ""papad"". It was too thin and too unlike my choice of taste.",2,"2018-11-21 14:41:01",5,1,0
"60375328","The food served by this restaurant seems fine if you are extrmely hungry. However, if you are eating just for taste then you might need to know a few things beforehand: 1. The pizza base is crispy and hard. It is a bit too chewy and also lacks the proper tasteful condiments. 2. The pizza toppings, especially for the vegetarians, are no good either. They just lie on the pizza as pieces meant for decoration. I, also, got a little burnt taste in my mouth while eating the pizza.
The restaurant looks okay and nothing too fancy. It is nice if you want to hang out with your friends and family. No pets are allowed and you cannot find every variety of food here. Overall I would call it an average restaurant, you can't complain much about it but you, also, can't go gaga over it.",3,"2018-11-21 13:59:02",6,0,0

Ovenstory Pizza, the most marketed kitchen of the Faasos group, has always been all over my social media. A break away from the usual Domino's and Pizza Hut, it brings a different taste to the table. I ordered:
🍕 PICANTE PANEER PIZZA (590*) -
A 9"" pie with moderate veggie toppings, a huge paneer tikka cube on each slice, and stringy cheese. Tasted average. Billed as a 'Chipotle Cheese base' but there was not the slightest hint of the same.
Coming to the price*, they have Buy one Get one (BOGO) offers that I could never figure out while ordering. So effectively one 9"" pie would cost around 300, which is moderate to slightly expensive. The quality of base, toppings could be improved.
For now, I'm going to stick with Pizza Hut for my pizza cravings, with Domino's coming next. Don't see myself ordering from this outlet.

Got this option to order from Oven story. Ordered a Kheema and Chicken Sausage Pizza. The delivery was done on time and it was hot when it arrived. The pizza size and portion is good.
The sausage amount was also lavish. However, the pizza seemed a tad oily for whatever reason. The cheese content was generous as well. Would like to give this place a 3.5 and would want to try another pizza as well. A must try at least once. ",3,"2018-07-13 14:17:07",77,669,1

It has various chicken toppings - chicken cubes/tikka, sausages, chicken salami.
It tasted different than the regular pizzas. They could've been more generous with cheese.
The crust was nice and filling. Something to order for chicken lovers.",4,"2018-07-06 12:17:45",56,326,0

I ordered just a margarita, not a bloody Chicago deep dish pizza right!
Well, not gonna order from this place again that's for sure. 
If pepper jack delivers to your location, just go for that. Their pizzas are good, especially cheese burst.

"37111569","To start with I ordered a Chipotle pizza, which in retrospect was a stupid choice on my part because I can't start spicy food.
So I didn't like the pizza at first. But nothing against the pizza, more personal bias. It was like eating curry on pizza.
But the second time I had the normal cheese pizza , it just made my day. So good. And the packaging and customer service is amazing too.
