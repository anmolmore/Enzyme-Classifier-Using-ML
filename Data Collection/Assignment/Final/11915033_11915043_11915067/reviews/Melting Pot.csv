"80010518","I tried chicken lollipop, Nalla miriyala Natukodi kabeb, special chicken biryani and chicken dum biryani. Among them lollipops is avg and kabeb is awesome both the biryani items were very dry doesn't seem good to consume but okay. Starters were crazy",3,"2019-04-11 15:12:43",7,5,0
"27375118","It is like bawarchi for the employees who work in hitech city gachibowli, their much hyped biryani is average at best, but it is always crowded since they are the only known restaurant which is very near to IT companies",3,"2019-03-24 03:40:02",18,38,0

Joke ??",1,"2019-01-20 22:03:48",1,1,0
"31071044","I have been here couple of times with the team.It is usually crowded in the afternoon. The taste is good and worth the money.one cannot expect a great ambience here as this is very crowded.",3,"2018-12-14 15:22:56",37,36,0
"39118650","Wonder why this place has such low rating. This place is near IT hub and thus close to many offices. It is a good escape from the office food. The food is tasty and reasonable. It is a food court so is usually crowded in lunch time. The quality of the food is good. ",4,"2018-11-01 16:18:48",50,69,0
"30307683","Actually would like to rate it 3.5!!
It's there in the food court of Kapil towers in front of ICICI bank.
I have tried dal, paneer, chili paneer, naan and roti from here. Panner butter masala is very good. .Quantity served in one plate is also good enough.Chilli paneer is also good
A decent place for a Lunch!!",3,"2018-10-22 01:59:33",179,1874,3
"8169781","This is food court food. We normally visit in a group. It tends to get a little busy in the afternoon. Food has variety. I have taken rotis and paneer. I have taken veg biriyani once. It is hygienic but taste could be better.",3,"2018-10-09 20:24:53",61,1188,0
"52141336","Melting pot is a food court of sorts located near driven café. It has many eateries which offer drinks, ice creams, fast food etc. The ambience is okayish as it is just a food court. You can see the sports cars parked outside through the main door. The food was pretty good given the price point. Good for a quick bite with friends.

"3093673","This is quite a nice place if you're looking out for some good Chinese cuisine in the area. Seriously you may not find any better chicken fried rice any where nearby. Since this place is very close to my office, its a rescue to my Chinese food cravings. So I'll give it a thumbs up, and do try if you're nearby. :)
