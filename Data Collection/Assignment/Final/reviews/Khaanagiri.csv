Guys be careful with your telephone order. The guy who receives your order through mobile forces you to take the order which you haven't ordered. Guys if you cant serve proper food request you not to waste our money. If there would have been less rating than 1...that would be the proper rating for this ""bahanagiri"".

T03 SPECIAL came with 1 paneer curry which was so bland and other two veg curries were also not at all tasty. We found all curries too oily. Rotis were not fresh, curd too had some absurd taste & smell. Papad (fried rings) were not fried well, they had some raw taste. Sweet (Sevaiya) lacked milk in it. Rice seems to have some soda in it as we felt heavy after eating just little quantity of it.¬†

We ordered Dal Makhani, fried rice and jal jeera from this horrible dump!!First things first... The food here is not about quantity and certainly not about quality. The Dal Makhani is 200 rupees and the container it came in is shorter than my index finger. And to make it worse its covered in a thick layer of oil. It has no salt or flavor ..in all honesty it tasted like some baked beans in mud water!!! The Quantity was so small it automatically makes you wonder if its about quality.. You cant send us bad food in little amounts and charge us more!!And rice, I find it unfair to call it fried rice when i all tasted was elachi...it felt like they cooked a giant elachi in the pan and added some rice in it. once again..no salt...like at all!!The Jal Jeera tasted bad too!!! I mean how can you get such simple items..so wrong. You have to exceptionally bad to do that. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!!!",1,"2017-12-18 01:38:10",97,97,1

Moreover, sent an inexperienced staff for delivery who every 2 mins called me up after landing in some random society. When I called the restaurant to look into this, they were unsympathetic and forced me to wait 2 mins when the delivery person took 30 mins to reach. The food was cold and only after telling them that I will put a bad review they agreed to replace it. KASHMIRI LASSI WAS more like curd smelling of garlic.

"75898","Ordered food from this place online. Delivery time was average. I ordered food twice. First I ordered combo of jeera rice, daal fry & curry and next time I ordered ghar ki thali.
Jeera rice daal fry were as awesome as was thali. The packing was done nicely so that nothing spills. The taste was also good. I liked the nilons pickle pouch which they give along. The curry for jeera rice combo was choley. I would suggest them to boil the peas little more as 50% of the chana were hard. This suggestion goes to the choley in thali as well. Chana in choley should be like dairy milk chocolate..it should melt as soon as in mouth üòã

"15984045","I used to love the Pulao from here. Used to order it from Khaanagiri for almost every mid night meal. Order I got yesterday is the worst pulao I have ever tasted. Carrots aren't boiled properly, too much black pepper. Something definitely changed here.",1.5,"2016-06-20 02:54:43",25,83,0
"22614439","The best food we have had in this India trip! Their veg khazana and paneer punjabi are to die for! With great taste as well as service, highly recommended to vegetarians in Hyderabad.",5,"2016-05-30 20:01:48",1,9,0
"32068640","I have ordered veg biryani and chole. Veg biryani was different, i would say it was more kind of veg pulav with full of vegetables. And chole was good, and tasty.
I loved the biryani since i have never got so much of vegetables like this. I would love to order something else and try it out.",3.5,"2016-05-09 08:52:08",54,49,0
"1776353","I ordered their food and it was wrapped for protection. Though it was a little more than needed but they'd out in effort to avoid spoilers.
The Dal Makhani was good and so was the Paneer Butter Masala.
The Pudina Parantha was a major bummer as it was made out of Maida, something I didn't expect. The tawa rotis were also decent.
A decent option when you want to try something different. Order carefully and you'll be good.",3.5,"2016-05-09 01:12:16",140,810,5
"33711981","I ordered paneer chilli , veg thali and fried rice. Unfortunately I have to say I didn't enjoy the meal at all. Firstly the food was delivered 40 minutes late. Secondly the taste of the food was very horrible. No salt in dishes , seasonal vegetables lacked taste and Paneer chilli was looking something else which I never saw before. Complete failure.",1.5,"2016-04-19 22:07:41",1,1,0
"33120027","Ordered so called Vegetable Biryani:
1. Quantity was very less compared to price.
2. Very small cup of Raita.
3. Poor packaging: Raita was spilled inside.
4. In the name of vegetables it had only gobi in it.
5. No Mirch ka Salan.",2,"2016-03-17 00:41:13",1,2,0
"442473","Ordered Veg. Biryani and Gobi paratha from this place. What an absolute mess! Have given special instructions to make it less spicy. The biryani was spicy beyond belief, with masala thick and flaming. The paratha was bigger than the largest pizza you can get at any restaurant. (Don't we all know what an average paratha would look like?) The Atta/maida wasn't cooked at the edges, had stuffing that was, quite literally, filled with red chilli powder. No taste of any Gobi at all. Took two bites and discarded the rest. Sorry, but this place is a strict no no! What an utter disappointment! ",1.5,"2016-03-16 21:29:07",9,8,0
"3542151","I tried their delicious Vegetable Biryani, with very less oil, for health conscious people like me along with yummy Rayta. The vegetable paratha was huge and heavily stuffed, which is sufficient for a single person's full meal.¬† They have items such as sattu ka paratha which is a really healthy dish to have in your menu.
My overall rating :
Service : 5/5
Food : 5/5
Cost : 5/5¬† - A definite value for money!
Note** A must try for those looking for homely food made with compete hygiene.",5,"2016-02-22 19:35:41",106,751,0
"5492341","Special Thaali - almost special 
First of all, this was continous two days in a row I was ordering from here. The first day i had Paneer Kholapuri n Tawa Roti which were really good. Paneer was cooked to perfection and had its tendery texture intact, which is the way I like my paneer. 
Today (20.02.2016) I ordered the special thaali, which had aloo jeera, rajma curry, daal, chole curry, pulav, raita, ghee roti, sweet, pappad and achar. 
On price index, this is full on value for money. Now coming to each individual dish of the pack, I would start with aloo jeera which had the balanced jeera thadka and aloo was properly boiled. Rajma curry wasn't anything outstanding but was having a good taste and here again the key ingredient was cooked to the spot. Though I am personally not a big fan of  white chole curry, this was still something that I would prefer to have another time only if they cut down on salt a bit. Daal was really tasty and to the right way i like it.
Coming to pulav, it was tasty and flavor full. Roti was also evenly cooked but I would have preferred a little less ghee on it. But here again raita was a big let down. I don't understand that why people here call it raita when it is loose as butter milk and only thing added in it is diced onions. Maybe my pallet has been opened to a different version of raita which I am not found of. But this let down was covered in the sweet. It was brilliant and bought back the taste of proper north indian sweet. Finally the achar, well it was a re. 1 packet of achar that you get in market. It would have been better if they could have served some in-house prepared achar. 
Overall it was a satisfying experience for my tummy, expect the few glitches but I surely overlook it and am ready to order another time and another.
NB: Nice packaging and speedy delivery. Its hard but a bit more warm food would had made it better.",3.5,"2016-02-21 00:07:35",3,28,0
