Their menu is under progress but on the request of our host we got Drumsticks Dum Biryani parceled as we were full on our visit there for complimentary lunch (whose review is also posted). This aromatic biryani had 2 chicken pieces and was quite spicy. I mean pepper spicy not chilli spicy and little dry.

"37381843","During my tasting session at American Wild Wings I tasted the food from Fire Blast Biryanis as well. Both of the restaurants are in the same location but each one is serving different cuisine. The Fire Blast Biryanis is serving more South Indian Style dishes such as different types of curries, rice, biryani, etc.
The food part was up to the standards. I tried the chicken fried pieces biryani and Kaju chicken curry. 
The biryani rice was fluffy, soft and flavoured, exactly what is expected. Chicken pieces were nicely cooked and the mirchi ka salan and raitha made the dish better.
I had the Kaju chicken curry with some steamed rice and it was a delicious dish. The curry was balanced on taste and chicken was not to dry as sometimes it happens to be. So the food part was satisfactory!
But the first problem that come into my mind is that you basically don’t know that this restaurant exists (and it serves good food!). There is no board, no stickers, no signs, nothing that says “Fire Blast Biryanis is here”. They serve their food in the same restaurant as AWW but they should put some advertising for this restaurant as well.
And the maintenance is not at the best levels, room for improvement here. 
If you’re not visiting the actual restaurant definitely you can order at home because the food is good and well priced. But I encourage to check the location as well.",3,"2019-05-08 20:43:15",173,332,3
"51764163","Ordered an egg biryani from here via zomato. The biryani had multiple small chicken pieces in it!!!! Had to literally throw it as I am an eggiterian.
The gravy had more oil in it than actual gravy!!!
Not to mention that nobody picked up the phone after calling multiple times.
What followed was a struggle with Zomato ""support"" which is a story for some other day.
If you don't eat non-veg, I wouldn't advise you to try this place.",1,"2019-05-02 22:32:55",3,1,2
