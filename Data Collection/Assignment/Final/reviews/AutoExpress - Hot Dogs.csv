"2571704","Monster box: They should probably stick to the sausages and breads. The veggie fingers and cheese fingers are more batter and less of the actual stuff. The fries are great though
The sauces compliment there food really well.",4,"2018-09-22 22:08:44",124,370,6

"33665373","I had clearly mentioned in customer comments saying I need a mix of Insane and Rebel Sauce. Chatted with Ur customer associate as well and they too confirmed that the information has been sent to the restaurant even then I just got Insane sauce and no rebel at all..... very bad way to handle from Zomato and Auto Express ",1,"2018-05-26 16:25:23",33,33,0

"35151224","I had ordered cheesy dog with insane sause. The bun completely enclosed the sausage and the sauces, making it easy to eat on the go. I loved the sausage and sauce was fine but the aftertaste wasn't that good. Still it was much better than the most hotdogs I've had. ",4,"2018-05-14 19:10:50",14,31,2

"30123713","This is not what Indians prefer. Its just a normal bread with sausage and sauce (lots and lots of sauce). Sauce can be really spicy depending on what you choose. The sausage is fine but overall the hot dog didn't match up to my expectation. ",2,"2017-10-25 21:40:09",69,572,0
"454362","Very average food. Tried the insane hot dog. Sauce was good, but the food in itself is nothing special. Its just a sausage, a bread and sauce. Price wise it is ok. Won't try again though.",3,"2017-10-22 20:18:42",25,28,0

"31801118","After hearing some good reviews from colleagues I planned to try their hot dogs. They have four types of sauces to choose from . We ordered for mini-hot dog , it had ¬†three servings ( 4-inch each) ¬†drizzled with 3 varieties of sauce of your choice . ¬†For me insane was the best variant of sauce . Rebel was kind of mediocre , as description stated there was a twist to mustard-ketchup combo,I was expecting a surprise element .¬†
Price : Value for money
Technique : The sausages are heated evenly due to equipment used.As the don't slit the bread , it is a lot less messy .¬†

"1305159","Rant.
The best hot-dog I have had and it's pretty average. At the AutoExpress, I tried the mustard sauce version called the ""rebel"", which took them around 5 minutes to prepare; it was decent at best. The bun was filled with a load of sauce and the sausage was dipped in it. In the last couple of times I had tried hot-dogs (at different places), one looked and tasted like chicken-65 vada-pav, and another looked like an actual hot dog from the pictures, but it straight out made me nauseated. But then, for its price, I can't really say that it's not a VFM.
I think I should just stick to shawarma as my quick evening snack until I find better hot-dog joints in Hyderabad.",3,"2017-02-12 08:47:19",11,49,1

"892874","Well in Hyderabad not many place which are hot dog exclusive.. Was very excited when I heard about this place. But was quite dissatisfied when I ate here. Only two varieties which is ok if they were tasty... Am sure as a business module this place MAYBE a success. But from a foodie point of view it's not worth a try.

"1727590","Had these hot dogs mire than 10 times. They are good. They have two varieties rebel and insane. Rebel is mustard and insane is spicy sauce. I like insane. My suggestion would be to have more options.",3.5,"2016-07-26 12:25:06",155,363,0
"2593808","This is hot dog chain. It's a mobile auto restaurant. Located near to Paradise gachibowli. There are only two varieties of hot dogs. Earlier it was priced at 50 now it's 60 for 6 inches one . And at 99 you get 3 pieces of hot dogs of 4 inches length. 
Rebel and insane are two varieties. They differ by spice levels. Rebel was less in spice and insane was spicy sauce. They told that Rebel Australian style sauce has mustard some other mix If I heard it clearly and insane is Indian spicy version.
I ordered insane. Sausage was grilled for sometime and given with bun with insane sauce. Sauce was good but not as spicy as I expected. I even tasted the Rebel one, it also good to be honest I liked rebel more than Insane. only variant is sauce. Sausage was smooth and hot just loved it. Bun was fresh. So try it.

"1404741","Have tried both the varieties of hot dogs served here. The difference is only in the sauces - one is rebel which is not so spicy, more of a mustard sauce , and the other is insane which is really spicy and has the taste of mayo and chilli mixed! Insane is my favourite of the sauces- the bread is good and warmed before served. The sausage is good too. At ‚Çπ50 per hot dog, its a must try to satiate an evening snack craving.",3.5,"2016-03-12 16:59:05",61,134,2
"952747","The taste of the hotdog is average, but for 50 bucks it is awesome. Liked the rebel flavor as the sauce used in it is better than the other one.
Not too good, but for this price it is acceptable.",3.5,"2016-03-01 22:37:21",32,112,0

"30505946","At 50 bucks, this a bomb! Very good VFM. The service and hygiene is excellent. The sausage is good and the hot dog buns are fresh. The packaging makes it quite handy for eating or takeaway. The only thing this place lacks is the variety of sauces and no veggies. The hot dog looks sad with just a sausage and sauce. Nevertheless, a must try place. ",4,"2016-01-31 13:40:42",37,193,0
"2960418","These are small autos modified to have a small kitchen that can serve you a hotdog.
The hotdogs are good , although the choice of sauce is very limited - ranch (spicy and less spicy). No mustard, no veggies, only sausage bun and sauce.
Opens till late night, so if you want a quick decent snack for 50 bucks, you can add another place to your list.
Service is quick and the hygiene is well regulated and cleanliness sets this place apart from other street food joints.",3,"2016-01-18 00:13:06",124,921,4
"4430961","These old autos are modified to make a small kitchen in it to make hotdogs . they have two flavours of hotdogs ( spicy and non spicy ) I tried spicy one and it's not good at all . they have a paste of chillies and mayonnese mixed in it.",2.5,"2016-01-06 17:37:29",62,89,0
"4419301","( Food Category - Non-Veg, Status - Halal) 
A novel concept of using an Auto which has been modified to make and serve hotdogs. 
They started with 3 vehicles strategically placed across town and my first visit to their mobile unit was at their vinayak nagar in Gachibowli.
Their are only two flavors to chose from , one is rebel and another insane.
Rebel has a mustard sauce that is used giving it the original feel, where as the insane has a spicy mayo kind of sauce that is used. It is spicy and flavorful and my favorite.
The sausages are procured from halal certified vendors and the hot dog bun is always fresh , they warm it up nicely using a hot rod on which the bun is skewered so that it is warn from the inside. The sausages are placed on a rotating warm metal roller so it is warm evenly. 
Even the packing for eating or takeaway is of good quality.
At Rs.50 this is a steal and must must try if you love chicken hot dogs.palatejournals.com",4.5,"2015-12-25 15:01:35",265,2214,2
