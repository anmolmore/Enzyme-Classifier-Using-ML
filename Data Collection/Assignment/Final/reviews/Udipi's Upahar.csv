"29110107","This place serve best South Indian food with awesome taste . I had iddli there and it's very floppy and taste is nice . It's better to pack food and eat at home , if you are alone or with friends then you can eat here . It is always crowed ",4,"2019-04-28 12:13:34",13,37,0
"47676142","Very good place to breakfast! Yes, the sitting area a problematic. Even to stand also its bit cramp as this place is always crowded for its best food.
Sometimes my day starts with a lip licking breakfast from here.

"42404920","The food they prepare is very good than other udipi hotels. The way they do parcel and the care they take for taste is good. Good food at good price.",5,"2019-03-03 14:55:23",4,4,0
"503459","Ambience is okay but the food is good. Regular Idly, Sambar Idly, Poori, Mysore Bonda, Dosa are good. Sambar, chutney are good in taste. A definite place to try the food.",4,"2019-02-28 16:12:54",124,174,0
"39263659","If it hadn‚Äôt been for my friend this place would have simple gone unnoticed. Your typical road side eatery and must have breakfast destinations. The pipping hot vadas are the best I‚Äôve had. Restricted myself to just one vada so that I could try other items. Butter steamed dosa and karampudi idli were good too. Visited this place on both the days for breakfast during my 2-day visit to Hyderabad.",5,"2019-02-04 09:02:42",78,1159,2
"2607804","Not up to mark as per it‚Äôs brand name. 
Food is just like ordinary tiffin centre‚Äôs 
Need to improve and provide food really authentic of Udipi 
Ambiance is really awkward no cleanliness even in Ac family section also ",2,"2019-02-01 20:09:25",26,37,0
"2571704","A regular tiffin place in gachibowli. Their idlis, Mysore bondas and vadas are all wonderful.
The sambat idlis are great too.
+ Super fast delivery",5,"2019-01-28 17:44:34",124,370,1
"35961364","FoodFor Friends in regards with taste it's too good but if you want to order something you need to be aware of packing.
Packing is not good i ordered sambar idly and they didnt gave me spoon how can a person eat sambar idly with put spoon.
Need to maintain those things other than that food is too good.
I will prefer to visit",3,"2019-01-13 13:08:44",7,2,0
"2977466","One of the best places to have South Indian tiffin varieties in Gachibowli area.¬† Most cost effective and tasty, quick fast food on offer. I enjoyed the food here and have tried out many times and on almost daily too.¬† If anyone have any doubt, the crowd that is present here almost all of the time should indicate the popularity of the joint here.¬†
Situated in a busy area on the Gachibowli main road near to the ORR inter-junction. You cannot miss the place. I have tried out their meals, tiffin varieties, the bhajji & pakodas in the evening and also their tea. Have been satisfied with all of it and do not have any complaints.¬†
Absolutely zero ambiance and its self service too. Be prepared for the rush and once you get the token, be prepared to be squeezed in a corner to give out your token to the waiters inside. There is no queue system here and they just collect your tokens at random.¬† When your food item is ready, they spot you and give it to you. Be prepared for some hassles out here as you get jostled around. Finding a spot to eat your food during rush hour is also a problem. There are a couple of tables to sit but majority of the others stand at the tables and eat. Just eat your food quick and rush out.¬†
My fav of theirs is the Dosa. I just loved the Chutney and the sambar taste even though it was a bit sweeter to my taste. Also loved the Kerala Parotta which is a fav dish of mine back home here in Chennai.",4,"2018-12-31 01:50:49",119,469,5
"1979790","Great place for a quick breakfast in Indira Nagar area. Dosas, Poori are good and the restaurant serve food faster. Hot beverages are available too. ",5,"2018-12-29 16:48:10",13,118,0
"12240271","Whenever we‚Äôre in Gachibowli, we definitely have our breakfast here. The quality of food is really good. And all the tiffins tastes amazing. My favourite is Vada. ",4,"2018-12-25 20:00:35",65,241,6
"48353445","When I first reached Hyderabad, I wanted to eat dosa and idli. Just like the ones I had in Chennai. So, after some research, I reached Udupi's upahar. The sambar was sweeter than I expected. I believe it is the Karnataka style. I still liked it. The Bonda was awesome and the price was comparatively low. Great experience. I would like it if they had spicier sambar.",4,"2018-12-09 20:27:01",11,7,0
"678733","No frills place. Many families frequent this restaurant. There is air conditioned seating area below. Don't expect great service, but the service will be quick. Prices reasonable. Pineapple kesari and parota kurma are must have.",5,"2018-12-01 21:55:45",23,6,0
"2449588","If you are looking for a good South Indian breakfast, then this place is a must-go. Prices is rather higher than any usual shop, but the quality would make worth spending that money.

"73294499","Good food, loved the south Indian dishes over here plus the ordering system is good. But I feel, they should have some more space. It gets hoch poch when it's crowded. Overall nice experience.",4,"2018-10-02 13:57:20",10,179,0
"34009097","I was here with my dad for a quick tiffin/ snack time on our way home. Frankly speaking, I wasn't expecting such good food. We had Masala Dosa, Idli and Vada. I felt there could have been a better variety of chutneys (like tamarind or ginger) apart from the regular coconut one. Not only did the food make us feel satiated, but also satisfied.

"48548728","I ordered so many times here food was really good and the sambar is good to have but chutney is not at all good and set dosa poori with kurma good to have all they have to do is to improve CHUTNEY!!!! PACKING 5/5",4,"2018-10-01 09:28:35",63,5709,0
"318655","It has the best rava idlis that you can get. I usually visit this place early in the morning on weekends. It‚Äôs always crowded. They have a seating area downstairs as well. It‚Äôs a place where you can have a quick bite and enjoy a cup of tea. ",4,"2018-09-28 13:25:38",3,14,0
"507433","The best Coconut chutney and Sambhar in town. Pick any food item and its delicious. You can say that by the crowd at their place to get anything. Must try Idli-sambhar, Poori Bhaji, Butter pav bhaji. ",4,"2018-09-23 13:30:36",92,349,1
"2162600","My go to place for all my South Indian Tiffin fixes in the city! 
Their pesarratu set dosas and podi idli is to die for! 
Ginger chai on the go is absolutely perfect for all kind of chai lovers! ",5,"2018-09-18 16:08:36",125,1810,2
"55891493","Whatever you order from there or eat their it‚Äôs alway good & delicious. Their Pineapple Kesari Bath is one of the best. The way they server food on banana leaf is awesome &  there are very few veg restaurants who serve food that way.",5,"2018-08-25 09:51:35",3,2,0
"39074618","The Coconut chutney here is great.
Food is prepared with less oil.

"4182091","This place is my default option for south indian breakfast. Located right on the Gachibowli-Kothaguda road, this place serves Poha, idli, dosa, uttapam, poori sabzi etc. Personally I prefer their south indian food.
There is a small juice counter outside the restaurant as well.
If you are looking for ambience then this place is not a great option but taste wise and cost wise it won't disappoint you!
Happy eating! :)",4,"2018-08-14 19:49:53",66,568,0
"46652926","Udipi's is perhaps one of the best budget friendly joints in the indiranagar area. Their ghee idly is a must try and so are their dosas. If you are there for breakfast, do try their poha. ",4,"2018-08-06 18:49:07",12,15,0

"48372980","This is one of the place, where you can find all the foods in a very reasonable price but it doesn't mean that you have to compromise with your taste buds. I have tried Veg manchurian, gobi manuchurian, idli sambhar, vada sambhar, dahi vada, dosa ( must try ) , puri and curry and poha. I tried one unique combination here and that is plain dosa with veg manchurian, and it was just yummm. I would suggest you as well to try this. ‚úåÔ∏è",4,"2018-08-02 20:47:11",90,148,0
