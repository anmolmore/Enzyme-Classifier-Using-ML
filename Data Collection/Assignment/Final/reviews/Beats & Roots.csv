"37978769","Ordered for chilli chicken noodles and vegetable Manchuria. I loved the Manchuria and noodles's taste, chilli chicken that they gave along with noodles was also good. It was bit oily but otherwise good. Quantity- Manchuria's quantity was good but not noodles', compared to other restaurant it was quite less. Quality wise I can't say, I had it in dinner, woke with upset stomach. May be my stomach is too sensitive or because of the excess oil I am guessing. Over all I would say taste was good, you can give it a try.",4,"2018-11-30 14:26:54",6,7,0

"71032115","one evening finally I went with my friends to enjoy the food & ordered Chicken biryani, Chicken lollypops,Chilly Chicken, baby corn crispy & finally Thick Shake .
chicken biryani : The taste is very good , on the same day I ate noon chicken Biryani in Paradise house near MGBS, but I really frustrated with that biryani and in the evening I came to beats & roots and had biryani I was impressed with chicken biryani taste is too good . Good quantity . Long grained rice,fragrant and chicken was very tender with spices well infused in it. Overall ,spice factor was on a higher side. But ultimately I enjoyed the good as the prices are very moderate compared to what we get.The price and output match perfectly. One doesnt get loaded after taking in one portion.Â 
List is good - talk about powerfull food. This is the one.
Really good food .",5,"2018-11-05 15:07:59",1,0,0
