Ice cream is already like liquid and dripping in the pack. What is the point of having ice cream delivered if you guys cannot deliver it as solid ice cream?
Not sure if this is a restaurant issue or zomato delivery issue. You should do something about it.",2,"2018-09-01 22:06:19",12,92,0

So basically we were really excited About the entire concept of nitrogen cream but when we went there no doubt the concept was different but the taste was as normal as possible

"245959","I am a regular visitor of SLN Terminus mall but never noticed that Mist n Creams serve the liquid nitrogen ice cream. I finally was here yesterday evening with my friend to try out their Liquid Nitrogen ice cream. The place is small since it is on the food court level with many other food outlets.
They have a variety of flavors to choose from. I chose the Nut-Kat flavor that is Nutella and Kit Kat. They have a processor in which they pour liquid nitrogen. The kit Kat was broken into tiny bits but was really yummy. I could actually feel even the smallest of crystals. Nutella was a little disappointing because it wasn't as chocolaty as I'd like.
If you are looking for Liquid nitrogen ice cream in Hyderabad, this is the only place that serves you and they have another outlet in Madhapur. They have a wide range of flavors to choose from and the prices are really reasonable. The flavors can be improved more though! They also have a beverage Cafe called Nourish where they serve you milkshakes and waffles.

"7406441","It is not a hidden fact that Chocolate Brownie takes me places. This time it was Mist n Creams at SLN Terminus. I had just finished my dinner and was craving for some dessert. When I saw this place. Went there and ordered my favorite Chocolate Brownie. They do not have a seating place of their own as such, just a common shared area. The waiting time was normal. I discussed the process they followed and came to know that they use liquid nitrogen and a machine to mix the contents that creates small crystals which gives a smooth texture to the ice cream. When I tasted it, it straight away melted in my mouth. The taste was very good. But I think the Brownie pieces could have been smaller. Overall a very nice place for ur sweet tooth.

"35495868","Dear Mist N Cream management,
While I was exploring your website I found that you have patent on process method but this process method is already exist in US, with patent rights, before you implemented in India. Do you expect no one will be in Indian market with this strategy?¬†

"20292985","For the late, late very late night ice cream cravings Mist n Creams is an exciting haven. Get ready to. be surprised if you are expecting a fanciful pretty set-up serving the clich√©d list flavors and blends. Many of us must have read about liquid nitrogen freezing at room temperature. Most of us must have experienced the fun working in the midst of fumes disbursed suddenly some odd chemical reaction. I must be sounding quirky while discussing like mad scientist instead of talking about strawberry, mango, chocolate, xyz flavors. Yes, the first time you visit ‚ÄúMist n Creams‚Äù I bet you can do without these thoughts. To put a pause to all the anxiety about this whimsical world of creamy ice creams, Mist n Creams is not an ordinary ice cream parlor serving frozen ice cream with toppings. They will actually take down order from you and instantly cook your ice cream in a blink of an eye, right in front of you. How is that possible? Liquid nitrogen, I was talking about, comes to aid. And in no time, not only your ice cream, but you too would be hemmed in fog....Read full post on foodeepanda.com",4,"2017-03-01 16:38:59",NA,1376,0
"1346456","I've been seeing a lot of liquid nitrogen being used on shows like MasterChef Australia so I was obviously excited to check this out. After a hearty meal at Norfest, we dropped by here partially out of curiosity and partially out of sweet cravings.
They have a very extensive menu and we finally went with this strawberry based fruit ice cream that I cannot recall the name of. It had a 10% off that day too. I have to admit, I liked the whole nitrogen fumes bit but it barely lasted 5 seconds. 
The ice cream itself was not bad. It had pieces of pear and pineapple in it. The waffle cone was average and nothing compared to those provided by Naturals or Guavaz. 
You can try it out if you're in the vicinity.",3.5,"2016-07-31 18:08:17",140,1690,2
"31961196","They make ice cream before your eyes. Now don't get too excited. Although the machines and place looks very interesting, it's just normal ice cream with artificial touch. 
I went here and saw this place in the food court and wanted to try and ordered Custard Apple ice cream. The guy went in and came with a bowl of milky stuff and let lots of liquid nitrogen pass over it. And bang! Ice cream is ready. The first spoon itself gave a lot of artificial impression, with which I couldn't enjoy the experience.
But do try out if you want to see ice cream prepared in front of you.",3.5,"2016-07-23 17:13:18",207,853,0
"11169881","An ice creamy tooth always craves for some ice cream, recently a bunch of colleagues went to have lunch at the SLN terminus, where we had a thali at Norfest which I dint click any pictures of though the food was decent enough with good portion size and taste, it was the Mist n Creams outlet on which I and my colleague had eyed on and we ended up taking Kiwi Kwik and Choco Lava, both the ice creams were made in the Liquid Nitrogen Mixers. I remember when I worked with CCMB, we used to store DNA in liquid nitrogen containers and I was looking forward to taste this unique ice cream made. The ice cream hit the flavor level on the spot, my only complaint was it got melted quickly. Do try out folks!",4,"2016-07-22 23:05:20",15,29,2
"5804381","Mist and Creams have the USP of making ice creams with Liquid Nitrogen which is a patented method. Sounds very interesting and has to be tried at least one. The menu is extensive has its all about having some good basic premixes and then adding toppings later. It may be overwhelming for first timers. Once finalized, the artist uses a premix (brought from counter behind) , puts it in a grinder in front of you, adds the liquid nitrogen and viola, it feels like magic and ice cream is formed. They he takes it back , adds the toppings and gives it to you.¬†
We had the most selling item - ¬†Fruit and Nut (Pineapple flavor with multiple fruits) - it was smooth for sure but the fruits toppings were little unusual. I would say good change. We also had the Choco Brownie - which was smooth but was too chocolaty ( I guess the premix was very strong)
Overall, definitely a good change and different type of ice cream that has to be tried at least once but I'm not sure if I'd go out of the way to get this thing in my hands.",3.5,"2016-07-17 16:09:02",175,2393,11
"934054","After a great feast at Norfest Dhaba in SLN teminus, we were heading back to our office and found Mist n creams outlet. I initially thought it was a regular ice cream parlor, but when one of my buddies said the ice cream here is made of liquid nitrogen, i was like super curious and definitely wanted to check that out. They have a big slide on the wall which has the explanation of how this thing actually works which was interesting to go through.
They have a super huge menu and its always confusing what to order when you have that big of a menu. We finally ordered choco brownie, Nut-Kat, creamy caramel, ¬†nuts about nuts and a fruit & nut. There were grinders kinda thing right infront of you and the waiter was mixing flavors one after the other and finally added the liquid nitrogen. All of a sudden that grinder turned into a volcanic explosion full of white smoke. It was as if the ice cream was being born from cold fire. It was very exciting to see the making process. Our ice creams were ready and are served on a waffle just like every other ice cream parlor. There was nothing unique about the taste, it tasted like every other ice cream from every other parlor that's there. All the ice creams were fine, I liked the choco brownie, it was good.
Overall ¬†a different experience, i got to see the ice cream and its making process the chemical way. Definitely the liquid nitrogen thingy is their USP and very riveting to it bursting out white smoke, but on the flip side that unique making process doesn't come with a unique taste. Prices were a bit expensive too.",3.5,"2016-07-12 23:19:23",180,741,12

"12733501","Mist and creams, took the ice cream eating experience to a whole new level by introducing the concept of liquid nitrogen. This liquid nitrogen is stored in Thermos called isotherm. specially made to handle the liquid form and it should be handled professionally. The ice cream here is made with the mix of the basic ingredients with the blender and then the liquid nitrogen is mixed to lock in the flavour and mix them accordingly. The fancy part comes into play when the liquid nitrogen is introduced to the pre mix.¬†
I was here a couple of times and my first experience was very exciting and i have become a child once again by watching the mixing reactions of mix and liquid nitrogen.¬†
Some of my favourite flavours are havloc, fruit and nut and brownie. And the best among the lot is the fruit and nut, because this particular ice cream looks like a frozen fruit salad and the toppings which they provide along with it. The taste is exceptional and choco infused fruit and nut will also be good, if you want to experiment.¬†

3/5 for the price, heavy on pocket when you compare this with the outlets like Ice Magic (Cream Stone is expensive to its core so I won't consider it while talking).
4/5 treat for taste buds, somewhat sweet that's why deduct 1 marks, else the ice cream was made to perfection.

The staff was very welcoming in showing how they make ice cream and also was pro active in suggesting their beat flavours.
The counter at the mall looked very clean and nice. They had couple of interesting discounts like wearing Superman T-shirt would give 20% discount, Facebook update mentioning them..etc.
Now coming on to the taste of the ice cream...definitely worth trying.

We had the Nut Cut Caramel and the Fruit n Nut variants. Since I love caramel based ice creams, we decided to have that one and as for Fruit n Nut, the tagline 'Most selling ice cream of all time' was very alluring. Also, it's pineapple flavored so it gives a very fruity feeling all throughout.

The taste of the ice cream was fine. They claimed the ice cream is supposed to taste softer due to instant chilling. May be it was softer, hard to say....the quality of softness in any of the outlets around the city is good and their taste wasnt worth differentiating.

"214285","Recommended by a friend. The concept of using Liquid Nitrogen for instantly making an ice cream seemed novel. They had good range of unique flavors too. The problem is they were too many of them. They should have a recommended section too to help people choose quickly.
Place with a simple decor. Pleasant. The concept is well explained on a chart. We opted for Awesome Twosome. Guava and Litchi combination. The ice cream was really good. The difference in texture was noticable. It was much more softer and smoother. They put fruits to top it up. The seeds in guava were a little annoying. Overall I am happy with the experience. ¬†¬†

Mist n Cream is located in newly opened SLN Terminus' FoodCourt.¬†
First, we read the process of making the icecream where they use Liquid Nitrogen at -196 degree Celsius to freeze the liquid mixture right in front of us.¬†
We found that their menu has lots of choices and options available. but, lot of choices lead to lot of confusion. After so much brain storming, we choose Litchi Flavor & Choco Delight. The guy started making our preparation, put the liquid mixture in bowl, start mixing it in blender and pour Liquid Nitrogen and finally we got our icecream. Really the taste was awesome and different compare to other usual one, it will readily melt in your mouth,
In our subsequent visits, we tried Choco Nut overload & Guava and me.
All were refreshing in taste. We liked the Guava flavored much.¬†

"2214576","I want to try ¬†liquid nitrogen ice cream ¬†that to which is made in front of us . I read about Mist n Cream which is near to my office. I ordered Kiwi Kick, Costa Lychee both are of good taste . I liked Costa Lychee the most. price wise it is ok. I also found same Mist n Creams van near kukatpally IDL road it will be there every evening up to 9 pm.but only few verities in menu compared to SLN terminal .",4,"2016-02-08 13:07:46",28,46,0
"7211261","Nazeef Nazir's parents were heading back to Mangalore the following day and also his sister-in-law wanted to ensure she had a taste of the famous Nitrogen Ice Cream and so we (Herwin Abhilash Kandoth) decided to catch up at Mist and Creams.
We would have visited the Mist and Creams outlet near Jubilee Hills but for some reason, they seem to be temporarily closed. Travelling to Hi-tech city wasn't something I find pleasant in the night (riding a 2-wheeler) but then again they were family and I wouldn't want to be the one to discourage someone from completing their wish list.. Also, I get to check-in and review the place on Zomato.
Mist and Creams outlet is located on the 3rd floor (food court) of this fancy looking shopping mall called SLN Terminus which is on the Gachibowli - Miyapur road. Since its a food court I wouldn't talk at length about the ambiance, but I do love their misty-blue colored logo, very appealing..
People love to gather around and see how the Nitrogen works its thing, clicking pictures, shooting slow-mo videos (I did a couple myself)..
We ordered the below Ice Creams,
Kiwi Kick
Tropical Queen
Lychee Fusion
Fruit and Nut
Costa Lychee
Choco Lava
All of them were good! Personally, I loved the Costa Lychee because it had Lychee and Coconut... Also Nazeef and myself were die-hard fans of the limited stock Coconut - Lychee Tropicana juice, so I guess it was inevitable that we would have loved this more than the others.. But, like I said all of them were good.. Also an FYI, Mist and Creams have patented their Ice Cream flavors so don't expect to find similar tastes elsewhere... !!gulpnmunch.com",4,"2016-01-29 00:29:29",164,2171,15
"330356","Plain Bad. I ate their so called artisan ice cream at the Madhapur food lane.
1) While placing order, guys were insisting on some nuts and something, which was 170 bucks. When I asked about other flavours, they informed that fruits are not available.
2) I saw that, they were pushing the same flavour on everybody else, discouraging to go for any other flavour.
3) If you have a menu card, why not all/ most of the flavours available? They informed that even if I order any other flavour, it will be plain ice cream, as, fruits are out of stock.
4) So, I went for 170 bucks flavour, which was so ordinary. Pineapple flavoured ice cream with some nuts.
Will not recommend. I wonder if the sales guys are paid in % rather than a salary, so they try to make and push one single flavour.",1,"2016-01-27 17:28:22",17,7,0
"1121803","One of the best, creamiest icecreams i have ever tasted. The quantity that they give for that price is a lot!! Its cheaper than most of the other popular icecream brands. They use liquid nitrogen to freeze icecream at lower temperature causing smaller crystals to form and this makes the ice cream rich and creamy. I would suggest you to go for the basic icecreams and not the high end, expensive ones with brownies, kitkats etc.",5,"2015-12-31 11:38:57",11,61,0
"32936624","I was drawn to this store because of their unique approach to making ice cream using liquid nitrogen. I had the Fruit n Nut, and was very impressed with the fresh fruit. The clean and modern aesthetic of the place was a plus! The presentation of the ice cream itself is also very appealing. I would really recommend this place to everyone.",5,"2015-12-28 23:46:42",1,5,0
"32928587","I've been to this Mist n Creams twice in the past months and tried multiple flavors and had a wonderful experience both times. The ice cream is absolutely delicious! I had the Gauva to Goa which is my personal favorite and has chunks of fresh guava. I also sampled the Choco Brownie and the Fruit n Nut. All were very tasty. The Fruit N Nut is a favorite of my mother's. ¬†I am especially impressed by the use of fresh fruit in the ice cream. Not to mention the innovative process of making the ice cream right in front of the customer. The ice cream is fresher and creamier than other ice cream that Ive had. Children will be especially delighted to see the liquid nitrogen used.¬†
The design is also very classy and the manager very friendly. I strongly recommend this to children and adults and will be letting my friends and family know about it. Check it out!",5,"2015-12-28 10:43:03",1,4,0
"151069","Tried the liquid nitrogen frozen ice cream from Mist n Creams and became an instant fan of the concept as well as the ice cream..they have an ice cream truck parked next to ratnadeep madhapur in the late evening hours as well and has been drawing quite a crowd!",4,"2015-12-21 23:53:59",174,476,3
"32843891","I've been here 3 times so far and tried a different flavor each time. Every flavor was amazing! The Guava to Goa was simply amazing and they are very generous with the fresh fruits. The added perk of no preservatives and smoother ice cream kicks things up a notch. The Awesome twosome and Smooth Criminal was also simply delicious and the flavor of roasted almond actually came through, which is very rare.¬†
Also when I took the ice cream home to save it for later, I expected it to be hard and crystallized, but I was pleasantly surprised! It was still almost just as smooth as when I ordered it.
Yes it's a little bit pricey but you pay for what you get!",5,"2015-12-21 14:09:13",6,3,0
"1397198","I had ordered a nutella icecream from this place and received a nuts icecream. I called and explained the situation - they said they will give it given I send the original one back, and I agreed. An hour later I called him again, and he says I am supposed to go there and give it then he will give the icecream I really ordered. Ordering from here was the worst mistake, I hope atleast you guys don't commit it.",1,"2015-12-19 15:36:50",7,4,0
"4430961","They make ice creams in a unique way with the use of liquid nitrogen and I think this is the first time in Hyderabad I've ever saw ice creams made with the use of liquid nitrogen ...and it feels soo damn cool in your mouth ...ice creams are good but I somehow dint like their Brownie ...dont expect much by their unique way of making ice creams",3.5,"2015-12-11 00:49:07",62,89,0
"32693557","This is a new ice cream joint in SLN Terminus (Spar Building) near Botanical Gardens. As an NRI, ¬†I have been to ice cream parlors all over the world. This is probably the best designed and coolest parlor I have seen - very modern and minimalist.¬†
I ordered ¬†FruitnNut ¬†(apparently their most popular flavor). The ice cream is actually made, from milk, fresh fruit, and nuts, ¬†right in front of you. The smoky/misty process ¬†adds a surreal ambiance ..........way cooler than just scooping up and adding toppings. Kids will just loved to see their ice cream made. The ice cream, as advertised, was smoother and softer than even the best places in Hyd. I It tasted great. ¬†I will definitely revisit soon.",4.5,"2015-12-07 11:27:38",2,3,0
"356540","The thing that sets this ice cream parlour apart from the rest is the use of innovative technology to prepare the ice cream right in front of you. Liquid nitrogen is basically the main ingredient that supposedly reduces the size of the crystals and makes the ice cream smoother in texture. Honestly, I couldn't really feel much of a difference, but seeing the process happening in front of you is definitely exciting.
If you happen to like ice creams, this is definitely one place to check out!",3.5,"2015-12-05 20:54:00",223,636,0

They have nice mouthwatering flavors on the menu.¬†
My first time experience : ¬†Their product is good, quite competitive, but priced a little higher on the scale. I believe you need to work harder guys...",2.5,"2015-11-20 10:55:20",63,101,0
