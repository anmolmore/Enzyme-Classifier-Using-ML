"3589451","So, this place is right outside DLF building at Gachibowli. The entire galli (lane) now resembles the many khao gallis of Mumbai, what with the countless number of eateries and street food joints all along the lane. 
It was 5 in the evening and I was at DLF building for some office work and my hunger pangs were at an all time high. Wanted to try something different than the usual aloo samosas, irani samosas and maggi that we guys keep eating all the time near DLF and suddenly I saw this place and felt like trying. 
Had the vada pao and chocolate milkshake. The pao was super soft and the vada tasty. However, I didn't like the shake too much and I think it is avoidable.
Verdict: Not so good. Not bad either.instagram.com",3.5,"2016-03-19 13:41:08",279,1947,0

"32503893","First of all, I don't understand why do they call it ""Jumbo King"" because the burgers(or vada) were nothing like Jumbo or King. Burgers are just fine but I didn't find anything much special about it.",2,"2015-12-05 11:40:22",8,31,0
"404957","Looking at the vadapav joint the feeling was a little nostalgic.... As I was missing Pune where I shifted from some time back. So my take on the vada pav .. Firstly... The burger buns ... Was a twist to the traditional vada pav.. Vada was fine... Yet my craving for the traditional vada pav wasn't satisfied. Though I appreciate their attempt.",2.5,"2015-12-02 20:00:06",63,101,0
"2280096","Good snacks corner... Do try the butter grilled one, the sabudana vada and the softies that they have.. Recommendations are for the corn and spinach one too.. ",3.5,"2015-11-17 23:13:43",74,266,0
"888824","Nice place for a quick bite. It was one of my favourite when I was in Mumbai and finding their outlet in Hyderabad gives me a reason for a joy. The burgers are really friendly on the pocket and you would be satiated.",4,"2015-10-16 19:46:07",45,175,0

"15823046","As usual had craving to eat vada pav and thought of trying at the new outlet then the usual ones.  outlet has different types of vada pav like cheese, butter, schezvan, grill and normal. Tried grill and normal one. None of them tasted like authentic vada pav nor like some burger. Its ready made vada is tasteless and pav is too sweet. Had even ordered sabudana vada. Had the worst vada of all time. Was surprised to see the shape if it. It was same like freezed biscuits directly fried and served. Nor it had proper sabudana nor the taste nor fried properly. 
Dont try at this place. You can go @ vada pav centre(small centre oppsite to fitness gym) inside lane opposite to madapur indian oil petrol pump 
Even vada pav centre near vodaphone madhapur is good one
Goli vada pav at kondapur is also good option then jumbo.

"894969","We tried Jumbo vada pav on Saturday. Tried cheese grilled vada pav and butter grilled vada pav. Taste is way different than authentic vada pav that you get in Mumbai or Pune. But still it is good to try and has different taste. Masala inside vada is more tasty and grilled pav gives a different feel. They claim to serve in 3 minutes.
If you are from Pune or Mumbai and missing vada pav, then it's worth trying. Only caution is not to compare with the one you get there in western Maharashtra.",3.5,"2015-07-23 21:16:37",209,4085,0
"1458260","Imagine a desi McDonalds. Now imagine the dishes being 20% the price of the aforementioned restaurant. Welcome to this joint. 
The menu is good. Simple enough to be ordered quickly.
A Pepsi combo and plain VP is 35 bucks. What can beat this pricing?
Cheese is 20rs extra. Not worth the price. The veggie pattie and the palak corn VP are nice.",4,"2015-06-11 18:31:08",18,117,0
"16744246","Oh I just loved the combo of regular vada pav with sprite.... The packing also neat... One feels they are having Indian Burger than Vada Pav but then that's okay in front of its taste...
I really like the taste and would also recommend people if they feel like trying vadapav do give it a try for Jumbo King",4.5,"2015-06-01 00:20:36",72,137,3
"907078","a nice place to have vada pav burger style... I tried the grill cheese vada pav... the taste of cheese was missing however the vada pav in itself had a good taste... also tried the thick shake along with that and must say that that was great as well... would definitely visit again to this place. Specially for the great masala that they keep to add over the vada pav... that's really great with its tangy flavour.
overall nice place to have a quick bite... and comes in everyone's budget...",3,"2015-05-23 23:08:56",80,1327,3

A nice place to satiate your craving for vadapav and they are quite good. 
Location : DLF , Gate 3 and very easy to locate on the main road
Ambiance : Clean and tidy with less amount of seating , concept is just pick ur stuff and eat while walking like how you get in mumbai. I guess there are 3-4 chairs in the outlet. 
Service : quite fast , got my order in 3-4 minutes
Food:  Went with the regular jumbo king and found that the pav is not your typical square pav that you get with your pav bhaji, this one is like a small mini burger which is round in shape but found it to be very soft and fresh a different style and unique and I loved it.
Option of customizing the spicy levels was there with chilli powder and green chilli's available which was another nice addition . 
The combo meal is a good option , have a vada pav and a small glass of cold drink for Rs.10 
Overall : Will try all the remaining items on menu soon as the taste is good.palatejournals.com",4,"2015-05-17 07:58:29",265,2214,1
