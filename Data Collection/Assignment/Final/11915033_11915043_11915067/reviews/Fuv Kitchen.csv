"36296120","Awesome food ! I ordered chilly garlic chicken and Chicken Dum Biryani. Both of them were absolute kick-ass. The pieces in Biryani were so well prepared that they almost melted in my mouth. The rice also was cooked well and had just the right amount of spice for my liking... And I being very particular when it comes to chicken was totally impressed ! I will definitely try the other items on the menu .... A huge thumbs up for your efforts.👍 Do maintain the same quality and keep rocking ! Cheers ! 🍻",5,"2018-10-04 10:55:40",2,4,0
