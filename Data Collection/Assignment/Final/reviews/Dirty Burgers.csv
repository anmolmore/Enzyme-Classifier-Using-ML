"57629159","I would recommend mutton gravy fries to everyone who goes there!
Add in a lumber jack or grilled cheese sandwich too!
Amazing dishes the burgers are good too but these are my highlights! ü§£",5,"2019-05-15 21:06:05",7,2,0
"718278","The burger was tasty. But the amvience is a mess and they really need good man power. Firstly they allowed a noisy group of people celebrating bachelorette. They were extremely noisy with some pompoms as well. It was extremely uncomfortable to put up with the noise. If you are hosting a private party then please don't keep it open for regular customers. It was late and less options so I waited for my food patiently. It wasn't pleasant and I don't think I will be coming back ",1,"2019-05-03 23:49:36",6,45,0
"34023006","Review on the basis of delivery item:
This place was on my list for a while. But turned out to be a completely different experience altogether.
Ordered fat boy burger, made payment etc. After 15 mins, got a reply that the restaurant had cancelled the order. Ordered another mutton burger, had the same instance. Try not to make such expectations from customers. It could frustrate them.
The packaging was extremely poor, just a white plain box.
Cheesy french fries: Was crispy. But extremely salty such that it was quite choking. The cheese was also too dry.
Explosion burger: The chicken patty was extremely dry and there was barely any taste in the burger. It was accompanied by potato chips which were satisactory.",2,"2019-04-30 12:56:14",107,226,2
"32600048","They didn't have a patty in the burgers, instead small pieces of chicken, which was weird and was really inconvenient. The chicken wings and onion rings were okay. The ambiance is quite pretty and they have board games too.
Wouldn't really visit it again.",3,"2019-04-10 09:46:40",67,220,1
"14812991","This place looked like a take away kind of place, because there were more Swiggy and Zomato people than the guests.
They make all their burgers fresh and hence they taste good.
We ordered one double decker chicken burger, veg burger and fries. Decent food and decent prices. ",4,"2019-04-06 18:05:08",168,425,6
"37401226","I had ordered a burger for dinner through zomato at my office. I tried the Fat boy burger. It was really disappointing. As mentioned, the patty was bad and not juicy or fresh at all. Also, no cheese as they said. Overall, the burger was bad and not what was expected. Definitely over priced for what was served. I'm really surprised to see a rating of 4. I wouldn't recommend this.

"3074831","Visited Dirty Burgers at Gachibowli on a friend‚Äôs recommendation and it was worth the visit. 
I picked their Lamb Hammered and Fat Boy burgers served over some chips. Their quality is on point with crispy patties and fresh bread. Big thumbs up from me! ",4,"2019-03-03 21:31:20",46,129,0
"350272","Place is about a year or so old. Good interiors, Have some board games to keep you going. 
Tasted the fat boy burger and it was indeed YUM! 
Peri Peri Fries was a big screw up for it was too salty, even though complaining made no difference but got a cold stare. 
However .. Service was quick. Should include some energy drinks too. Will visit again soon and hopefully upgrade the star rating",3,"2019-03-01 12:51:04",56,88,0
"3093673","Who'd love to have this crispy crunchy platter of veg strips with creamy Mayo üòç
Had this yesterday at Dirty Burgers located in Gachibowli market.
I had higher expectations from this place since they serve some amazing Peri Peri fries and burgers as well. But this wasn't actually that great",3,"2019-02-28 18:16:34",66,83,1

The burgers are really tasty. The ambience is that of a fun cafe, with board games available on each table to play.
Service is also good.

"57398630","Pretty good lamb burgers. We ordered onion rings,fat boy burger, pepper don't preach and the spark plug. All three burgers were flavourful and juicy. The onion rings were well seasoned and hot. Overall a 5 star experience. One less star for the chips that came with the burgers. They were stale and tasted weird like old pringles. Maybe consider serving fresh french fries. Will definitely be a regular at this joint.",4,"2019-02-06 21:19:44",6,1,0
"27668","The burgers are nice but then the fillings are too less for such big buns. It can be much improved. Compared to the price they charge the burger is of no worth. And add ons are like minuscule. Stop looting the customers. You can do far better than this.",1,"2019-02-04 08:20:28",35,241,0
"20321911","This place sits quietly among all the other eateries of Indiranagar but serves really amazing food.
I visited this place in the evening around 5 and it was all empty.
The service was prompt and chef prepared our food with customisation.
Coming to ambience, it had awesome posters all around the place, many of them Game of Thrones based!
I would definitely visit this place again to try the other dishes as well.",5,"2019-01-31 16:53:44",31,80,1
"51156365","Burgers at dirty burgers are totally disappointing. Recently I've been to their gachibowli outlet and was shocked on how the burgers patty was made. It wasn't cooked properly. Pricing was also disappointing. ",3,"2019-01-05 00:04:48",33,883,1
"2598562","I had their Dragon's Bay burger. To put in one word - disappointed. Was unable to figure out where the cheese was in that burger. The sunny side up barely had a sunny side to it. The bacon and chicken cubes were fine. The size of the burger was decent... This dirty burger was not dirty at all.
The service guy did his job. Took orders. Nothing exceptional there. They took forever to make the burger (I had so much expectations because of this).
Ambience is fine. They have chess, jenga, uno to play. It's a fine place to spend time with friends. If you're searching for an amazing burger place, this ain't one. ",3,"2019-01-01 21:48:08",1,56,0
"229397","A nicely put together place in heart of gachibowli, it is small place with limited menu. We orderd a chicken burger and a chicken sandwich. Burger was awesome but sandwich was ok. The owner had placed board games on all the tables so that you can do something while waiting for your food. Overall will like to visit the place again and spend some quality time there.",4,"2019-01-01 15:17:55",16,98,0

"478838","I was on work in financial district and it happens to be the lunch time, so my friend has suggested me this place as she has already tasted their burgers. So we went in there and the place was pretty much empty which is a nice thing you can ask for, peace of mind right?  The interior is very modern and concept based and i liked it a lot. We‚Äôve ordered Aloha burger, sweaty palm, peri peri fries and spicy chicken strips. Probably these are one of the best burgers i‚Äôve ever tasted. I‚Äôve become a huge fan of their burgers. As for the chicken strips they were just ok, not so tasty, they need to work on it taste good. Definitely a must visit place if you are a burger lover",4,"2018-12-18 19:58:01",199,180,6

"32589289","There are very few weekends when I don't treat myself with a meaty dirty burger.... Unfortunately coming to Hyderabad, I was missing the burgers... Decided that this Friday I am going to explore the burger places around and dig into a dirty burger....
To my surprise I found a place named as Dirty Burger... I was excited as it wasn't far from where I stay... Went through the menu. It was fairly simple and easy to understand... There were some heavy burgers and was getting tempted to order. Since it was my first time, I decided to go with rather safe option. Ordered for a lamb burger with bacon and cheese in it.
The delivery happened on time. I ordered from Zomato and a Swiggy person delivered the order. It was strange but I wasn't in a mood to do any research as the burger was right in front of me.
The burger was good... The Patty and bacon was cooked to perfection. Every bite I could taste lamb and bacon. I must admit it wasn't as greasy as I expected but it was a good start.
Instead of fries they served potato chips... Not sure why... But no complaints. It was a decent burger and sufficient for dinner.. will look for more dirty burgers in future",5,"2018-11-09 22:13:52",146,242,1

I had ordered 9to5 burger. The description says it's American classic burger. I wonder if Italian seasoning is used in American burgers (pun indicated...!!)
It has a large bun containing grilled chicken skewers, topped with an omelet, stuffed with onions, capsicum. But Italian seasoning took away the essence of a burger.
It came with few french fries.
I felt a bit overpriced.
Can be tried since it's new in this part of the city. It could be heavenly for mutton/lamb lovers. Basically, I am a chicken/pork person and options are less in them.",3,"2018-11-08 22:57:39",207,611,1

For all those burger lover trust me this is a nice place to catch up some nice burgers... The atmosphere of the restaurant is unique and beautiful...
I realized little late after talk to the owner of the store he said the store was open almost 6 months back.. It mean I never saw the store.. The visibility is very less to the store so I missed it..
Bit heavy on the pocket.. Only suggestion of mine is to give more fries üçü...
Rest all good to come üîô.",4,"2018-11-04 22:18:46",59,135,4
"682986","Pretty average place and it's essentially a pint sized outlet. The hype about their burgers caught my attention and gave them a try. But it turned out to be an underwhelming experience. Burgers lacked juicyness, cheese, flavour, texture and almost everything was lacking. It was a cut, copy and paste of mc veggie albeit with little extra oomph to catch your attention. Pricing is too high for what the burgers offer. One time visit.. ",2,"2018-11-04 16:16:54",79,1181,3
"30307683","I am big fun of burgers so like to try burgers from different outlet. Found this burger outlet in the Indiranagar.
The ambience of this place is very good.It's not a big outlet,has around 6-7 tables. What's different in there is that they have many games like uno cards, Zenga and some board games which makes it a nice place to hang out with friends. Music is also very nice at this place and is in correct volume.
Coming to food,I ordered a Dirty Veg burger and chilli cheese fries.Fries was good but didn't like the burger.It was too salty and it didn't taste good. It had a vegetable patty with lettuce,tomato and onion with special dirty sauce. I don't know if it was this dirty sauce or excess spices that spoiled the taste of the burger.
Fries -4/5
Burger -2/5
Owner is very cordial and humble.",3,"2018-11-01 02:27:31",179,1874,2

We had been planning to check this place out for sometime now, finally we made it today and we sure weren't disappointed.

"34969199","The first and absolute last time that my flatmate and I order from this restaurant.
Had ordered the Sweaty Palm burger and the Chicken 9to5 burger. The worst burgers that we've had till now. They looked more like mashed potatoes rather than normal burgers as they completely crumbled the moment we tried lifting them up from the boxes.
Also, the fries tasted stale and disgustingly bitter.
I'm sure you have other great options but please stop making the aforementioned burgers. Just please.
I would demand an apology and a refund but I'm too disappointed to initiate anything. This is my first review on Zomato, and that itself speaks volumes about how much this experience has affected me and my friend.",1,"2018-10-01 21:05:20",4,3,0

I particularly liked the Sweaty Palm, its one of the best in their arsenal. The chicken was juicy and the sauces were just amazing. Perfect unison.
Explosion was huge but a little too dry and bland in taste. ",4,"2018-09-09 06:47:56",4,4,0

"2155892","Suddenly discovered this cute place while walking on the Indiranagar stretch of numerous eateries. Dirty Burgers is located next to Thickshake factory, watch closely least you miss it. Went inside and checked out the decor.
Decor: cute, not ott, small place with around 9-10 tables. Each one has at least one board game atop to pass time while waiting for your food. So that's what we did. Ordered burgers and played chess.
Food: The menu is compact and no nonsense. Burgers are the main available dish and modest varieties are there. I ordered a lamb one with bacon wrap. My friend ordered ""screwed up cottage"" burger and peri peri fries. My burger was tasty, except for the over crispy bacon ends. The veg burger was okay-ish as the taste was good but the bread didn't seem too perky. Fries were abundant.
Price: Chicken and Mutton burgers show striking difference in pricing. At least of 100rs. The place is small but their rates are comparable to bigger joints. Not super costly but not too less either for Lambs. Chicken and Veg Burgers, you got a deal!
Will come back? Yeah I think I will!",3,"2018-08-27 11:13:23",98,426,0

So, one day I finally ordered it, quantity of fries was pretty good. And nutella was evenly spread in all the fries. But honestly I didn't like it, it was just too dry. I had to sip in water after almost every bite. Fries were very very crunchy. And after eating almost half the amount, I just couldn't take in more. Plus after it got cold, it became even more dry Sadly I had to throw the remaining away.",3,"2018-08-13 00:40:55",175,571,1

We said we wanted regular water. They said they don't have regular water. Then we asked how do u cook then? Then he said he has regular water but doesn't have glass so we'll have to buy the water.
Now providing water is a basic courtesy. Water is a basic amenity. Our bill was for 513, why couldn't they provide us regular water? They are doing business at the cost of humanity by refusing to provide regular water. It's because of this reason that it's my first and last visit to the place. The food is good but the place lacks humanity.",1,"2018-08-09 23:25:11",3,0,0

So we went to this place on a Saturday evening for some yummy burgers. This is a small resto with few tables and some quirky tv show posters on the walls and few board games for time pass. so good job with the decor, thumbs up for that.
Now coming to the food, we ordered sweaty palm chicken burger and some chilli cheese French fries to go along with it. The burger was tasty but as the name implies you need to get your hands dirty with the sauces from the burger to eat it . The bread was soft and sauces were well spiced and juicy. Overall the burger was really good. The fries were good but the cheese was little dry and chillies were just sprinkled all over it. It was ok but not that great.
Coming to the worst part the service. There is only one guy to serve food and take orders. He was trying hard to keep up with the orders from what we call a full house at the restaurant . Looks like the kitchen staff takes too much time to cook. It would‚Äôve been ok if the burgers took time but burger was on our table within minutes but it took half an hour for chilli cheese fries.Few people came in saw that there was no one to take orders and left . I can say they lost 10 customers in the half an hour that we waited for fries. So if the management is reading this please improve your service it would definitely help your business.
Even though the burger was tasty I don‚Äôt think it lives up to the price they charge when you add it along with the service. So if you are someone ordering burgers online then go ahead and order without a doubt. But for dine in I will say go there only if you have lots of free time to spare.",3,"2018-07-25 17:18:03",79,291,2

The burgers were awfully small for the price. The place was a decoration failure. The taste and quality didn't deserve a price more than Rs. 90.
The waiting time was too long for that tiny burger (45 mins).
Wasted 360 Rupees.

"1903288","Tried some chicken burgers late night. Was surprised such a delightful place was available at odd hours.
Went in and you definitely notice the decor. A rustic ambiance with card games invite you in. We ordered the chicken 9 to 5 and Sweaty Palm burgers. Both the burgers were delicious. The 9 to 5 came with thick pepper chicken patty with a fried egg on top. It went well with the flaky burger buns and crispy fries on the side.
But it was the Sweaty Palm which took the cake. Juicy patty with some thick gravy was out of the world. I have tried burgers in quite a number of places around the world and I will not shy to say it was one of the better ones.
Overall the burgers were delicious. The only thing i would mention is the pricing. For the price, you would expect slightly more quantity or the size of the burgers. Have been to multiple other burger places of similar size and given the burger quantity, the pricing would be lower.
They have multiple other options on the menu so would give another go.

Because,¬†although the 9 to 5 burger is priced at INR 260 (excluding taxes), the restaurant serves two burgers and a small helping of fries for that much money. The burger patty was nice and juicy and the sauces gave it a nicely balanced flavor.¬†The service was prompt, courteous and polite.¬†The ambiance is really cozy, and the drum-shaped sink is quite quirky. Lastly, the presence of many board games is a welcome sight.¬†Carry on the good work.",4,"2018-06-26 14:32:39",5,123,0

I like the concept and the name..
Service is really good as well.
...
So first time I ordered 9 to 5 burger with extra.bacone... that was a good burger, packet in anjic box, with proper branding and all, but the issue here was, the bun was really big compared to the fillings, taste was really good.
Today I ordered a fat boy, it came in a regular packing withought any branding, I liked the burger, nice juicy mutton patty, with perfect veggies and sauces in it, but the but needs to be of better quality here please..

"4532951","Indira Nagar is slowly becoming the Road Number 36, Jubilee Hills of Gachibowli. Small or big, a lot of eateries line up the road. One such tiny one is Dirty Burgers.
Located near Karachi Bakery, the place shares a common wall with Thickshake Factory. Bonus: You can place, and receive, your Thickshake Factory order, while sitting in Dirty Burgers.
My visit was on a Tuesday, right after office. Dropping by at around 7.30 p.m., the two of us were early for dinner, but hungry enough.
The place, as I said, isn't that big. Wooden benches and tables serve the seating purpose. If you're someone who's into English shows, you'll find a lot of posters on the wall to stare at. The tables are also stocked with board games to help pass the time. The lighting is perfect for the ambience
Coming to our order, we went with Screwed Over Cottage (veg) and Fat Boy (non-veg) burgers, and Peri Peri fries. For the drinks, we ordered them from Thickshake, and paid up for them as and when they arrived.
Speaking of the burgers, they get served with a portion of fries. The veg one was good, a bit spicy, but had no much trace of cottage cheese. The quantity of peri peri fries was quite a lot.
Our total was vaguely around 700+. A one time visit place, but a good one to hangout. ",3,"2018-05-28 21:51:02",150,2105,6
