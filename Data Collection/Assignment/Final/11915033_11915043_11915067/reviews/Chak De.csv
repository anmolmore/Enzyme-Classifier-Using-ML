"100754569","The pulkha offer by the Chak De is the best. It reminds the roti of north. The quality of foods including chicken biryani, paneer butter masala, egg burji etc are the best to order. ",5,"2019-05-01 14:50:44",2,0,0
"67437544","The food quality is very poor. It's not value for money.. Food is not hygienic. This restaurant is eligible for 0 rating. Donno why they are running with worst quality and service. I dont recommend others to go there. They registered in uber eats with the name udipi darshini hotel.. Be aware with this hotel. ",1,"2019-04-19 19:25:48",7,7,0
"12401711","I have never been to this place. My experience is based on online orders. I had ordered litti chokha from here, I find it decent.
I will suggest people looking at this review to try out the same dish from Desi bytes, gachibowli. Quality wise I find this dish better in Desi bytes. ",3,"2019-03-20 23:15:16",3,0,0

"38424818","In Hyderabad this was my go to place to have snacks as well as main course both for veg and non veg food. The quality of the food is really good with respect to its price. My favourite snack here is chicken 65, chilli chicken and chicken Chowmien. To add to all of this there are a lot of varieties in main course as well.",5,"2019-02-09 19:42:39",64,47,0

"43420228","This has been a regular Meetup place with friends as prices are decent. Restaurant had a good reputation, but seemed to have some problems in maintenance now a days. We had tried almost every item on the menu along with their daily A la carte breakfast every morning. Among breakfast, Dosa and vada were good. In the menu, boneless chicken biryani at below 150 bucks worth a try. Chicken noodles and fried rice can be customised upon our taste and spice levels. Chapathis, with butter chicken is not a bad deal.",3,"2018-10-17 03:21:56",46,23,0
"31143732","We ordered dal makhani, plain rice, omlette and chicken lollipop. Average taste, good quantity, pocket-friendly. However the reason for giving them such low rating is that they replaced dal makhani with dal fry after taking consent but did not bother to adjust the total bill price. Took 10bucks extra just because they did not feel like revising the bill. This happened even after I asked them to revise the bill. Money swindling is a crime, not matter whether it's 10bucks or 100bucks.. ",1,"2018-10-16 18:33:02",123,580,0

"33503433","It was one of the few late night delivery restaurants which prompted me to order from here. Ordered from here on a Friday night and the below summarizes my experience.¬†
Presentation/Packaging- An average packaging you would find anywhere and everywhere. The usual plastic boxes for the gravies as well as the rice and noodles. 3/5
Service- Came in almost on time. A usual service. Decent I may put it. 3/5
Food- I really did not like what I got. It was so spicy that I started coughing and had teary eyes and my nose running. We ordered the following-:
Two Chinese combos which had-:
Noodles- The usual Hakka Noodles which was quite fine but was so spicy that I could barely eat. 1/5
Fried Rice- This one was pretty decent as compared to whatever else i ate. It was medium spicy which could suit a random Indian. 3/5
Veg Manchurian- It is dry and not having any gravy. I mean did they expect me to have fried rice and noodles alone with no gravy. This was more like a starter. Heights of stupidity not sending a gravy but a dry Manchurian. It was so spicy that i managed to have just two balls. rest was wasted. 1/5
Salad- When they mention salad, you would expect a Kim chi Salad or some nice salad. It was just the usual onions with lime you get at any restaurant for free. LOL. 1/5
A Tip for them- Please cook as per what an average Indian can eat. If someone wants it bland or super spicy, they will mention it to you via Special Instructions. Was a total waste of money for me.
Will i order from here again? NO WAY!!!",2,"2018-06-11 14:17:19",316,1157,1

"36566953","Was here for a quick lunch as it is near to my office.
We had a boneless chicken biryani, egg burji, butter phulka and chapati.
The chicken pieces in the biryani were decent but the rice was not cooked properly. The egg burji and the butter phulka, chapati were decent options for lunch.
This place is decent if you want to grab quick food near to the gachibowli flyover. It ia worth the value for money as the prices in the menu were reasonable.
Overall I would rate this place as,

"38571401","After reading some reviews in Zomato, we went to have a lunch there on Saturday afternoon. It is located near signal in Gachibowli.
About the restaurant, It is small casual restaurant having nearly 20-25 seats.
In four of us, three are NV. About us, we are from Tamil Nadu and we love Biriyani of Hyd and actually we got addicted to that.
For three of us, we ordered family pack and my Veg friend ordered veg combo.
First about Biriyani, Sorry for saying this , that was the worst biriyaani we ever had in Hyderabad. There was no taste at all. They just simply add some masala to rice and served it. We got huge disappointment.
But about Veg, those two chapati's and the curry served was superb. For the first time we wanted to have veg :(
May be the day was not good for us with this restaurant. And there service is good !!
Finally,
It was a huge disappointment.
