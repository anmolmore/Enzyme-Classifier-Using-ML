"29205968","Rocks was not available and we were routed to Alchemy.  Ambience is good but poor maintenance.  We didn’t expect that we will sweat in Ella Hotels..
No ice cubes in Cocktails.
Worst experience",1,"2019-04-01 01:02:25",10,8,0
"29557326","Went here for an anniversary dinner recently. Lovely and posh little restaurant tucked away in a corner. Not many people knew about it I guess because we were the only people there for a long time. Food was delectable, especially the fish. Ambience was also superb at night; grab a seat by the window with it's waterfall. Would definitely recommend this place for a romantic evening.",4,"2019-02-05 21:32:24",3,0,0
"27556747","I have been here with my office colleagues. The food served in the Buffet was ""OK"". 
We ordered for a Water Melon juice around 8.30 pm and waited till 9.45 pm and there is no juice yet. We reminded them again and now it's 10.30 pm and the juice didn't show up. We asked the person wearing a suit with a small notebook who seems to be the head for serving department. He is completely surprised by his negligence and seems to be forgotten about our multi-reminded order. Even his attitude is not really professional and we felt he is providing us food for free. Usually unlimited drinks are ordered for 2 hours. My colleagues started drinking at 9.00 pm and at 10.30 this guy came and announced it's your last 10 mins for drinks supply. Whatt!!! When we said that we noted down the start time and it's still 30 mins to go, he started arguing with us. 
We felt this hotel doesn't have a customer oriented environment and the staff here are not really courteous towards their guests..
I would suggest to choose a better place than this where you get better food, better service and of-course for a better price..",1,"2018-12-03 15:11:44",2,0,0

"46355289","We have order a plate of mutton biriyani and a plate of chicken kassa but instead of that they given mutton kassa but I was surprised after eating the mutton . The taste is very good and the mutton was very well cooked I loved it so much and in the biriyani there’s is no perfume  flavour which we usually get in Calcutta",5,"2018-09-03 04:08:55",6,5,0
"390963","Alchemy lounge is the pan asian and Mediterranean restaurant belonging to the Ella Hotels, Gachibowli
. It looked desserted when I visited for a lunch during a weekend. The decor looked nice for the place. After having a quick glance through the menu, I settled for a set menu which was priced at 399+taxes  as it looked VFM to me. 
I was attended by the restaurant manager himself. I was not asked about choice of water and a 
packed bottled water was kept on the table. The food took a good amount of time to arrive.
That day, I ordered - shrimp stuffed chicken soup, thai chilli lemon grass prawns, 
eight treasure chicken fried rice along with some chilli chicken and crispy ruby in dessert. The soup was tad salty that was again modified to bring down the salt level. Other than that rest all of the dishes were well cooked  and tasted nice. The crispy ruby(water chestnuts in coconut milk/tub tim grob) in dessert was heaven. 
After finishing everything, while I was thinking it was VFM, the bill came. And voila, the 60/- MRP waterbottle was charged at 130/-. Which could have been 472(399+18% GST) rose to 624(529+18% GST), all because of  a water bottle!!!",4,"2018-08-27 19:04:43",114,530,7
"1095112","It has lovely ambience. Most of the time this place wont be crowded.
Food and service was good. Bit pricy compared to other restaurants within Ella
Verdict - for people who like silent places",4,"2018-08-06 19:37:38",27,4,0

"42241708","We landed in this restaurant on 7th of April  around 2pm as we stayed at Ellaa for 2 nights and we wanted to wait for a while after the check out. So they had some Dim Sum package with 1 beer and a soup included in it. We ordered for that, the server tells us Beers not available and said we can have mocktail instead of that so I told him we don’t like mock tails but we would like some fresh juice and if they could give us 2 glasses of juice with the package but he said we can only give 1 glass of fresh juice, we were like fine. He said name of few juices and we said we are fine with watermelon juice. He comes back and tells us there is only grape juice available. The guy had no clue about what they have and do t have and not even good with customer service. If we were Ella guests Ellaa wouldn’t go on roads because of extra juice as they didn’t have beers. Also he denied to give us soup one by two. We left without having anything. Sick Service!!!

"2543074","It was a lazy day for me in Hyderabad and I thought of ordering my food in. Ordered a biryani and some fish fry and enjoyed my lunch to the last time. While we love our plate of Biryani to look exquisite and classy, I would call the biryani at Ella homely. ",4,"2018-03-07 23:59:23",26,211,1
"47770117","We had dinner buffet here, the food tasted good but the service was zero as there were no waiters to serve, it was completely self service. The price was 800/- which was not worth at all. I won't recommend anyone to visit this place.",1,"2018-02-25 14:06:37",8,101,0

"30859020","Been here for my birthday party. It was a complete disaster. They did not have half of the ones in liquor menu. Food was disappointing. Had to shift the party to another one. Would not recommend this . ",1,"2017-06-11 19:52:38",10,7,0
"30370005","Review update: Just replized that this is not a normal restaurant, the hotel had made a make shift arrangements due to other events at the property. This is a bar and lounge and the set up is fairly decent...Not here for snack or drinks hence can't review that however a hotel of this cadre should still have to be ready enough for such events, I'd recommend a try or follow other reviews to make ur choice.
Original review-we are staying here and the restaurant does not have food to serve. We confirmed from the reception regarding the buffet and when we went to eat dinner at 8.30pm, the staff said we dont have buffet you me order ala carte. The menu was brought to us as a photocopy with limited items without prices, photo attached. Pathetic services.",3,"2016-12-17 20:42:00",11,149,1
"32904059","I love the ambience at Alchemy, by far the best restaurant at Ella Hotels! 
We had ordered beer, chai, pakori, aloo matar ki tikki & daal rice.
The chai was superb and so were the pakoris. Aloo matar tikki at any restaurant at Ella is superb. Daal rice were good too.",4,"2016-11-13 13:35:09",92,894,5

"16569526","Have been a regular visitor to Alchemy for years. Love the ambience and the food. Especially the water flow over the glasses of the Restraunt.
There's this small open area too with serene surroundings. Good part about the place is most of the times it's pretty quiet and not too crowdy. 
Last time was there on my anniversary and was really touched by the warmth of the super cool staff. The wonderful Kiwi cake was complimentary from them :)
All in all a great family place. ",4.5,"2015-07-06 15:00:41",24,1611,0

"13817","Valentines night at Alchemy (Ella Hotels)
Visited alchemy prompted by a coupon on snapdeal.
The place was properly decorated for the occassion with heart shaped stuff all over (Including cucumber served) .We were greeted with roses. They had a seating arranged outside also with miniature water flows. Inside ,the DJ played some bollywood numbers. I felt the dance floor was too small to host a DJ.  Tried some cocktails which were not praise worthy. They also served some starters on table all of which were horrible. The buffet (cannot attribute this to alchemy as it was arranged in Nirva Spa pool side) post the drinks was really awesome with live barbeque and wide variety of valentine desserts
Ambiance : 4.5
Food : 3 ( Excluding the buffet)
Service : 3.5
No comments on the price as this was a deal. We had more than a value for money experience.",3.5,"2013-02-15 14:01:31",97,1342,0
