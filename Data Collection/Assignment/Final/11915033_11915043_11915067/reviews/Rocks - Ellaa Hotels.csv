No ice cubes in LIT... 
Staff admitted that they missed to update Zomato.

Mushroom was toooooooo oily deep fried. No taste.
Happy hours on paper but no drinks available for happy hours.
Even though it is next to my house..there seems to be no reason would like to visit again.",1,"2019-02-01 19:43:07",21,67,0
"29223328","Not great with aesthetic appeal. The setup is pretty congested and looks more like a living room. Also, the prices are equally high as of a high end bar or pub. Totally unhappening with very less foot fall. If wanna have some quiet time alone, that's a match for you otherwise not recommended. ",3,"2018-08-26 04:21:30",53,272,0

"14541441","A bar,  bit on the costlier side,  with great ambience and service. This place is good for friends catching up for a drink or two after a long span. No body to disturb you around even if the bar is full to accommodation. ",4,"2016-07-22 13:39:50",685,792,0

The boys serving here are very courteous and pretty accommodating.  I especially like their Fish with broccoli. 
Over all great place to be.",4,"2015-07-06 14:50:31",24,1611,0
