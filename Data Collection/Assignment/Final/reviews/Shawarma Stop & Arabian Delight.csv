Have tried almost all the varieties available here. Chicken cheese shwarma is the best one.

"35836801","It's a small shop beside road. I have been there once or twice. They offer a variety of shawarmas that too in a reasonable price. The only thing I didn't like that the chicken stuffing was a bit too oily. ",3,"2017-02-11 17:53:24",247,316,0

"240089","Had taken chicken and veg shawarma.
Chicken was anytime better than the veg one. Stuffing was generous. The white sauce aka mayonnaise used was a little less and hence it tasted better.

"31526621","We ordered the food online .
Taste is good but the filling is less even in special shawarma !
A good thick filling would be really awesome and more dressing as well !",3,"2016-06-18 17:49:30",34,177,0
"7943351","Better than most of other shawarma shops. I have a big complain from Hyderabadi Shawarma shops, why don't you guys heat the chopped chicken slices properly and why not give cheese sauce with it. Also, who adds onion and cabbage in chicken shawarma.
I am from Delhi and 'Al Bake' can be called as 'Madina' of Shawarma lovers. Well cooked, well chopped and with ample cheese sauce.
Well about this place, Veg falafal was equally good.
Its a small outlet and can be missed, so keep your eyes on this place.
Easy on pocket and good on stomach. A try is always worthy.",4,"2016-06-07 13:28:54",116,158,0

"214506","Tried the Falafel in Rumali. Khubbus was not available that day. 
The falafel were not too fresh but were microwaved. I would prefer more flavour in them. 
The Garlic Mayo was thick enough as to not leak. 
The salad was fresh and the veggies retained a good bite.

"1052349","Its a small stall in gachibowli, located in an area which has many such small food stalls around. We had chicken shawarma roll which was just average in taste.

"103549","I didn't had much craving for food in dinner, my family wanted to have lite food kind of roll so went to food panda searching for roll home delivery . I found this place for which minimum order was 250, so I ordered 3 double chicken shawarma and 1 plate chicken momo . I got the confirmation of order and it was delivered on time. I started eating the momo 1st didn't like one bit of it. It was pretty bad.
Then ate chicken shawarma which was good taste full chicken and sauce .
I would love again to try shawarma

"30536104","I have had shawarma from lot of places but I did not find anything great from here. the stuffing was very less although we ordered special chicken shawarma. Even a rating of 1 seems to be over rated in my opinion",1,"2015-06-28 22:39:38",3,0,0
"3181596","There's nothing below 1 on zomato I can rate, in reality I would rate this -5/5. Pathatic would be the only word to describe the shawarms from this place. He's literally selling rumali rotis hardly with chicken filling. And that too half cooked. I have tried out spl chicken shawarma. If some one has it for the first time here u'll not have a shawarma for rest of ur life.

"170269","I stumbled upon this shop last evening on my way to Yosta. There is nothing much of an ambiance .
Its clean , they have a fridge and a microwave that barely functions , but its not something that would drive you a way , but yes eating in is the best option - home delivery isn't . The microwave barely warms the shawarma and will loose heat in 5 mins, complaints about cold food aren't surprising ...
I had the SPL shawarma in roomali roti - quite a mouthful this. Loaded with double chicken and some cucumber and some punchy sauce - Spicy mayo probably not sure. The chicken/marination itself is spicy and leaves your mouth zingy.
All in all - pretty filling and pretty happy if they can keep up consistency thegastronomix.net",3.5,"2015-05-05 06:00:15",305,2418,2
