"51813170","Guys believe me this place is very good for the price you pay at restaurant. I am regular costumer for this restaurant, I am surprised by the rates at Zomato. We usually get all the dishes for half the price what is shown here.. Zomato is increasing the price and giving offer on that ,still the price is more than what you pay at Restaurant.

"44558235","Ordered online
Chicken kothu parotta, Sambar rice nd egg veechu parotta
All the items are good in taste.. Not out of the box at the same time not worst even. They are gud to have with less oil.
The only reason for less rating is due to packaging..
I donno who uses foil boxes for packing sambar rice.. and they placed it in b/w two other boxes.. so by the time it reached me entire sambar rice is out of box due to pressure from top box..
Suggestion for outlet is use plastic boxes for packing sambar rice...",3,"2018-04-10 20:25:18",23,1086,0
