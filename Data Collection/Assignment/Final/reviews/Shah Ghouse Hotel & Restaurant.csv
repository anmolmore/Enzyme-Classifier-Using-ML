"55683853","I have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and I have never been so upset. Of course I have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which I ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now. Orders can't go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city. Yet another incident today where my order was wrong. You can check with my name what I ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th May'19.
Hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes I wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. They deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time. Guess Zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right. ",1,"2019-05-08 02:35:25",1,2,1

I had ordered for mutton biryani nd I got noodles which are ugly... Wow I am so happy for that
Good keep it up(bullshit)
How careless they are for delivering this type of service to customer who orders for food
This is really disgusting and bullshit
I suggest everyone not to order any food from this restaurant(Shah ghouse gachibowli)
Better remove service from zomato
Many of our friends had many issues from this restaurant, like delivering different food from ordered food, and delivering one shawarma instead of two and others

"33512719","I visited this place with my brother after reading some great reviews and ratings on Zomato. Though the restaurant claims to be authentic original Hyderabadi taste the Gachibowli branch was open in 2015. Given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic. It looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there. Staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining.
So for ambiance and hygiene it's a complete NO...
Food was okay we ordered Apollo fish starter which was very hard. And spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and Paradise or Pista house has better taste than it. Quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us. And it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings.
I would not be visiting or suggesting this place to anyone. ",2,"2019-04-07 02:05:13",15,34,3

"80270017","To sum it up - ""Amazingly Delicious"".
We ordered the enormous Tandoori Family Platter, fresh Apollo fish and the massive ""Jumbo Pack"" Biryani.
Tandoori Family Platter (hand for scale) - This beast consist of 5 whole chickens (different kebabs), boti kebabs and seekh kebabs ... Served with 8 rumali rotis
and
Apollo Fish (The plate in top middle which is not so small but looks tiny in front of the platter)
Jumbo Pack Biryani - This delicious biryani is the one to die for. Arguably, one of the best Hyderabadi Biryani, it is served with Egg curry & raita and can easily feed an entire family.
Price:
Tandoori Family Platter: Rs. 1300/-
Apollo Fish: Rs. 240/-
Jumbo Pack Biryani: Rs.600/-
Food : 4.5/5
Service : 4/5

"914654","Visited this place on 24 March,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.
Ambiance
=========
Its a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.
Service
=========
The waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.
Food
=========
Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended ""Family Pack"" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the ""Family Pack"" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder,  this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.
Value for Money
============
All these food, for just  thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.
Lets calculate,
Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25
Final Thoughts
=============
If you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must! Highly Recommended!",4,"2019-03-30 11:09:05",31,69,3

Chicken Tandoori is roasted and spices are marinated well and biryani is worth for waiting. Remaining items are better to ignore ( Roti and kebabs)
Dessert - kurbani ka meta is delicious.
Pros: Budget friendly
Cos: long waiting especially on weekends

This time we had chicken majestic, punjabi chicken with butter naan and biryani everything was so good and even the staff was very courteous to us.
Ps: Dont expect a fancy ambience just visit for their food.",4,"2019-03-10 13:35:19",19,5,1
"16022493","The best Haleem.
During my post-grad, we would order a lot of Mutton Biryani and Haleem from Shah Ghouse. The Biryani was heavenly and Haleem, well really really good. Much better than the famous cousin Paradise. ",4,"2019-03-09 20:58:28",71,125,0
"364365","Absolutely wonderful Veg Biryaani..... You read it right, you might be wondering how in the world would anyone praise an VEG biryaani... You have to taste it to believe it... Full of flavour and filling quantity which calls for VFM. I have tasted biryaani at various cities but this takes the award over all others. Please note that this review and ratings is for the biryaani alone.",5,"2019-03-08 21:16:23",33,13,1

I ordered Mutton special biryani, until this one I have other biryanis has my favorite, after having this my priority changed to shah ghouse,it was a perfect biryani with correct amount of spices and pieces were too good to taste.i tasted almost all famous hyderabadi biryanis this one is the best among them.

"48646174","This is my fav. Desitination whr i can find my type of food. I love the biryani here and the shawarma. Mutton biryani is best biryani thn chicken. I hve tried mandi too, as i like shahghouse evry dish is special fr me. Haleem is spl. Fan base, many stopped having food here as this restaurant wnt thrgh the allegations of serving dog's meat, to be honest I can bite and say which meat it is either it is goat or sheep, or beef I can figure it out easily. I never served with dog's meat, instead some fools spread the news. Shahghouse you have happy living. Do open a branch in secbad too soon. Atleast takeaway fr shawarma and biryani. Cause i like ur shawarma filling. It fills the empty stomach to the fullest.",5,"2019-03-07 16:51:25",6,0,0
"1984978","I ordered Veg biryani this afternoon. I was hungry and really wanted to savour every bite of my biryani.
But wen my order arrived .. it was egg biryani instead of veg biryani.
Like I mentioned I was really hungry, so I threw away the eggs and had to eat the plain bagara rice. Forgot to even click the picture.
It's the worst experience with biryani ever.
I hope this doesn't repeat to anybody else. Hence I'm writing an immediate review. ",1,"2019-03-07 16:07:48",67,435,0
"40178193","This restaurant is highly acclaimed for its Biryani. Sure the Biryani tastes quite good no doubt about that.
Online orders: They never accept order in time. Besides that they cancel after an hour or so while we wait the whole time for them to accept the order.
Al-A-Cart: The staff is extremely rude, they don‚Äôt seem to care, they waste a huge time to take order and will be supplies in another hour. Don‚Äôt be surprised to see massive queue outside the restaurant and don‚Äôt be deceived... The staff don‚Äôt give a heck about you..",1,"2019-03-07 15:41:20",18,18,0

"29133035","Came to Hyderabad for the first time and locals over here suggested the biryani over here and we were mind blown by their excellent taste. The next day we went to try the biryani from original paradise and I have to admit they we're not able to keep up our expectations as you guys did.
