"166651","One of the rare underrated places in Gachibowli. This seems to be a kitchen which only has an online takeaway option. Ordered some amazing dishes from this place Pepper Garlic Chicken was just amazing with right consistency of batter and nice blend of sauces. Have ordered online on Swiggy many times and have never been disappointed.
Another dish which I like personally is the Twin Pepper Paneer. Soft Paneer deep fried and prepared with bell peppers is a delight to eat. The Soft noodles I have had was the veg version which was really soft and less spicy. Kids just loved it.¬† When we have a party at home, Fish majestic and Dragon Chicken lit up the entire atmosphere.
Chicken Thukpa they serve is an interesting variant of the Thukpa that we get in the highlands. With loads of vegetables, chunks of chicken and Noodles it makes up for a complete meal even though it is a soup. Thank you for cooking up a storm everytime we order. Their menu is exhaustive and offers many options for veg and non-vegetarians alike. Would definitely recommend this place to someone who wants to try the Indo-Chinese delicacies at affordable prices and amazing taste.",5,"2019-05-03 20:36:03",78,2465,0

Totally the experience with this restaurant SUCKS!",1,"2019-03-18 18:44:20",2,1,0

"573349","Located in the bylanes of Gachibowli going towards Manikonda through Naga Hills, this small establishment of Woks and Tongs has recently setup space, to serve as a cravings buster to whole of the IT corridor in the area. Serving primarily Chinese with a decently priced menu and a variety of options for both vegetarians and non vegetarians, the place is sure gaining momentum.  Coming up with a neat and clean packing having a good portion size, the place does justify the amount charged. 
Coming to the food, I recently sampled some of their dishes which included their Pepper Chicken and Dragon Chicken along with Chicken and Egg Chili Garlic Noodles. While the Pepper Chicken had crispy fried chicken marinated with loads of black pepper, the Dragon Chicken in contrast had juicy succulent bite sized chicken pieces tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce with a generous amount of cashews. Dragon Chicken however did have a lot of oil dripping down which did cause a little discomfort to the eyes. The noodles on the other hand were a complete disaster having no flavours of chili or garlic whatsoever. A suggestion to the management would be to probably revise the recipe a little to infuse a little bit more flavour to the dish making it stand out individually without the help of any other gravy or appetizer. 
Calling in directly from the restaurant, the delivery of my order was actually quite a disaster due to the long delivery time. However, delivery options like Zomato and Swiggy are available for the joint so getting food fast shouldn't be much of a problem. In a nutshell, the place seems to me as an upgraded - more hygienic and clean version of a Chinese hawker stand since the recipes and taste do go into that similar dimension but delivered hot and fresh, the place does promise to elevate the experience.instagram.com",4,"2019-03-04 21:30:54",241,3414,1
"74914870","A good recommendation came my way for Indo-Chinese food and this is the goto place. This place only delivers food on online platforms so it was no way that I could visit this place but the food that they provided was really good. The Pepper Garlic Chicken and Twin Pepper Paneer are amazing variations to the regular Chinese food that you get elsewhere. Tried the Chicken Thukpa which was amazing. They have another pot meal in Chicken Chopper Noodles which is Noodles topped with Chicken in a pot which was quiet good and filling for one person. Seems like a hidden treasure in Hyderabad has just been discovered.
The noodles can be improved but I would give the benefit of doubt here because the Chinese food is supposed to be piping hot and not cold as it becomes in most of the delivery restaurants.",5,"2019-03-04 12:55:45",13,27,0
"50113671","This is the perfect place to satisfy your Chinese cravings, by not being so heavy on the pockets. Just relax and order from Woks & Tongs, which delivers you hygienic Chinese food with a neat packing.Tried the Pepper Chicken which was delicious and had the pepper aroma in every bite. Not so spicy, yet flavorful.
Dragon Chicken - Perfectly cooked and a good amount of cashews were added, which made the dish more tasty.
Chicken Noodles - Noodles were not on point, as it lacks flavor. It can be improved.
Overall, had a good experience.!",4,"2019-03-03 13:35:41",76,180,3
"132137","This place can be your weekday hunger saviour! Dont want to burn a hole in your pocket by going to a fine dining restaurant? At the same time dont want to punish your health by eating roadside? Sit back and order food from Woks and Tongs. This place doesn't promise you a Mainland China but then doesn't give you a roadside experience either. It's a comfort food provider that cost just a little more than roadside but what you get is hygienic Chinese food with proper packing.
Tried Chicken 65, Chili Mushroom, Chicken Noodles a d Chicken fried rice.
While everything was as expected, noodles were a let down. The quality of Noodles was ol but they were undercooked.
Chicken 65 was amazing. Big chunks of pure chicken, moderately spiced a d well cooked.
Chilli mushroom was again well cooked and sauced.
Fried rice was just perfect. I'd like it to be a little more flavoured.
Overall a a satisfactory option. Packing was decent. ",4,"2019-02-28 23:33:06",222,3013,1

"42644949","Seems to be a newly opened place near Manikonda. Last night we felt like having some good Chinese food and thought of giving this place a try. Ordered online last night from Woks n Tongs. We Ordered for Chicken Pepper Lemon Soup and Chicken Momos for the Starters. The Soup was full of¬† flavors and you can feel the presence of each and every ingredients that was used to prepare the soup in your mouth. I would say one of the best momos that I have eaten in Hyderabad till now.
Coming to the Main Course we had ordered Fish in Black Pepper Sauce along with Seafood Bhami Goreng. Both the dishes were complementing each other well. The Bhami Goreng was having a very distinctive flavor which I guess came with the peanuts and masalas that they used and it was just awesome.
I definitely recommend this place to all if you need have a craving for Chinese.¬†
Good Food Woks n Tongs and thanks for the same.",5,"2018-06-12 15:55:10",5,8,0
"38265990","This is one of the most amazing places to order food from. They are a delivery only restaurant which delivers around Manikonda. Being my first time with them I stuck to the regular items and didn't try any of their fancy stuff. The Twin Pepper Paneer was amazing and must try. The 2nd item the Chicken Wonton Fry which was crispy and having the juices of the chicken within.
Chicken Burnt Garlic Fried Rice was my favourite and was cooked well and so was the Veg Singapore Noodles which the kids really enjoyed it. Will surely order more from this place in the coming days. This is a Chinese Food outlet so if you have a craving for some delicious Chinese food this should be the place to order from. Since it is not a fusion Chinese outlet people may find it less spicy for themselves but that is how the Chinese food is supposed to be less spicy but more on the smooth texture.",5,"2018-06-12 15:27:08",5,22,0
"2648830","Ordered from this place last night by calling them.Had chicken Red Thai Curry and Chicken Fried Rice. Both the dishes were delicious and even though they did not had the delivery boy but the owner was so courteous that he himself delivered the food even though it was 11:45pm. Good place to order Chinese and Thai food",5,"2018-04-13 15:27:39",72,1064,0
