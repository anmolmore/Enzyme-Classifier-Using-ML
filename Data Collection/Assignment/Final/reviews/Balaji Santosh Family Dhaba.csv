"50931643","Had tried Paneer Butter Masala, Veg 65 and Chilly Paneer from this restaurant.
The above items were pretty average in taste. Paneer Butter Masala and Veg 65 were okay but the Chilly Paneer was below average. I was expecting a more of strong chilli flavor but it had very mild flavors and was a little tasteless.",3,"2019-04-13 15:06:40",74,64,0
"52721752","I ordered 2 items kadhai paneer and paneer parantha. First of all i will talk about the paneer dish. It was a nice dish and gravy was well prepared so if u wish to eat paneer order this one for sure. Now i will talk about the parantha. It was like a plain parantha no stuffing it never looked or tasted like a paneer parantha so never order this ever from this place.",3,"2019-03-23 14:39:45",24,8,2
"3325631","Really good on : Pricing - Quantity - Taste
I usually orders Paneer Biriyani which is great in taste and not spicy like others.¬†
Yesterday I ordered Paneer Biriyani and Mushroom 65. Mushroom 65 quantity is more than sufficient for 2 people and tasty too.¬†
Recommended for vegetarians.
I gave 4 star bcz I never visited the place[1 point reserved for this :)], rated as per food. Used to order from different food apps.
Thank You.",4,"2019-03-18 10:48:38",12,20,0
"37897954","I was sick and went to tomato soup. It was weird and was tasting too much elachi flavour. My sister order veg Manchurian which was not that great. She couldn't complete it. So she asked the waiter to pack it for which he questioned us ghat mein khana pakate nahin kya. It was first time ever I heard a comment like that anywhere ",2,"2019-03-11 16:37:46",2,30,0
"1093051","What's this man ? I thought they are pure Jain's. Really are they selling now prawns. Gachibowli Balaji really waste of money. It was only place to have pure veg food.",1,"2019-02-07 12:25:13",1,0,0
"36263035","A decent place to visit. This is especially for the vegetarians as it a pure veg restaurant. Decent ambience, nothing exemplary but with quick service and decent pricing, this is a place one can visit with friends and looking to just eat.",3,"2018-12-17 07:55:02",59,182,1

I have tried Shahi Paneer, Paneer Chatpata, Kadhai Paneer, Veg Kolhapuri and Paneer Korma. All are good in taste.
Ordering 1 sabzi is enough for 2 people.
Boondi raita is also nice.
One suggestion is that they should add Wheat roti to their menu.",5,"2018-08-19 10:00:08",3,1,0
