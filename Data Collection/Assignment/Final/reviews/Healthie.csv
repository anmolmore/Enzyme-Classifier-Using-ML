"35855466","I ordered a Black Beast sandwich (veg) from the restaurant through Zomato. But What I got was a sandwich with meat in it, which unfortunately I got to know after taking a bite out of it. Being a pure vegetarian it felt revolting after understanding what just happened. This was a gross negligence from the restaurant side which resulted in putting physical and well as emotional strain on me, exactly opposite of what good food is supposed to do.",1,"2019-04-26 16:50:24",2,3,0

"35769975","I have requested for Grilled Chicken Balsamic Onion and Zesty Grilled Chicken Salad. 
The package was neatly wrapped up in a small box. 
Coming to the food: The Grilled Chicken Balsamic Onion Sandwich is a combination of Sub and Burger. The bread used was a Multi Grain one. Moderate amount of mayonnaise but, good quantity of veggies and chicken. Very Yummy, the bread was really fresh and tasty.
Zesty Grilled Chicken Salad. The box was full of chicken pieces and sliced black olives. Mouth watering to look and it tasted as good as it looked. Chicken was nicely grilled with salt and pepper. Tomato and lettuce doubled the taste of it.

"1346516","Its difficult to find healthy food which tastes good too but nowadays lot of resturants have started focusing on that ! Healthie is definately one of them ! 
Note : This was a food review program ! 
We tried healthie chole chawal and farm veggies with quinoa ! 
Rice was very light and chole was boiled properly due to which it was very soft ! 
Veggies was very fresh , infact i ate half portion next day lunch and still it didnt ruined ! 
Quinoa is not everyones cup of tea, so if are aware of them, than order else you wont find them good...
Only issue what i found was price and quantity, 
The quantity was less for sure for what price the customer pays , 1 meal was not suffice ! 
Other than that, definately try them out and before trying do checkout exactly what they are serving ! ",4,"2018-11-26 13:10:38",126,337,3
