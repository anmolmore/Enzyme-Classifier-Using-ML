Its shape is called The Egg Waffle. It is Famous in Hong Kong and Macau.The waffles were soft but not as good as the classic ones. It was an okay dessert.",3,"2019-05-03 17:11:35",27,9,1

I had few best seller waffles listed in there menu,
WAFL PIZZA PIE : Smoked Chicken & Pepper, For a fun twist on an old classic, try these amazingly delicious Chicken pizza waffles! Stuffed with smoked chicken,pepper and cheese, this is the perfect meal!
ALL DAY BREAKFAST: Grilled Chocolate,
Waffles should be crispy on the outside and tender almost cake-like on the inside. So if you really can‚Äôt have chocolate cake for breakfast, go for these! 
WAFL SANDWICHES: Chicken club waffle,
These fun, hearty waffle sandwiches make a delicious meal.
HONG KONG WAFL: The¬†KitKat Bubble Waffle with Nutella as the base and a dollop of chocolate ice cream and a crown of KitKat is a must try!
BELGIAN WAFL: Of course, you get the regular Belgian waffles here, that‚Äôs the most common variety, and they do those well too. Choose from Choco chips, Choco peanut butter , seasonal fresh fruit, Nutella Nuts, Black Currant and very very berry and Banofee-banana & Toffee Belgian waffles.
So next time you're in gachibowli, you know that these waffles would be waiting for you!",4,"2019-03-27 17:40:39",69,704,10

"33376100","I was recently here for a session.
This is located in Nanakramguda, Gachibowli. The place looks decent.
This is not just your regular dessert waffles place. They have breakfast waffles, waffwiches, waffle sundaes, corn dogs, savory waffles, waffle pizza pies, bubble waffles, shakes, soft serve, coffee and coolers. Yes, the menu is really big.
Waffles : 
I have tried - chocolate heaven waffle, black forest bubble waffle and assorted seasonal fruit waffle. 
Chocolate heaven was good and black forest could have been better. But the seasonal fruit waffle was the best. It was so good and is a must try when you visit them. 
Corn dogs :
This is the first time I'm trying them in Hyderabad. They have varieties according to our local palate and favorites. I have tried - Chicken seekh corn dog and chicken cheese and onion corn dog. Both of them were good. They are subtle in flavor and not over powering at all. 
The soft serve here is served in their signature J-tubes. The concept wise, it's good. The soft serve definitely tastes amazing. But the tube is little hard, which should be taken care of. 
I definitely am going back to try others from the menu. ",4,"2019-03-25 17:29:56",260,3287,6
"41928997","Waffles are one of those things which we can have them all day for breakfast,lunch,snacks & also for dinner as a dessert. But, few people think they are too sweet & gives you a lot of fat Percentage into your body. But,what if the waffle is healthy?? How is it gonna be healthy?? You might say that I have gone mad..!! .
But,yes a waffle can be healthy too. This 'Seasonal fruit waffle' @wafl.gachibowli is very healthy as it topped with all the healthy fruits like kiwi,strawberry,apple,banana & a dollop of whip cream which is not healthy,but goes well with the waffle. We also tried their Chocolate heaven waffle which was topped with vanilla cream & chocolate sauce which was not as crispy as it if from the outside....it could be done a little crispier. We also gave a try on mint monitor which was completely refreshing with it's mint leaves. Apart from these items,they do have bubble waffles...from which we ordered black forest bubble waffle which was good in taste-wise...but I felt it would have been good if they added some more Amount of black forest crumble in it.
.
They do have all-day breakfast menu in the waffles section which every person will love it.
.
Thanks,wafl

"35216855","Concept was really different one. They make Pizza's, Burgers, Sandwich with Waffles. But Taste was not you the mark! If You order Chicken , You may not like the item as they provide processed chicken pieces which makes the taste odd ! Ambiance and Staff are Cool ! ",3,"2019-03-21 00:30:19",10,3,4

Loved the chochochip waffle! (must try)
The maple syrup waffle was good but the choice of ice cream wasn't specified (or given as an option)
Did not like the 'very very berry' it was extremely sweet. ",3,"2019-03-03 01:50:47",96,351,1

"40044997","I had ordered from this place. They provided stale food which wasn't edible. The only part I ate made me feel nauseous for the whole night and had to vomit a couple of times too. My suggestion is that any of you never visit this place or order from here.",1,"2019-02-02 02:05:12",4,6,0
