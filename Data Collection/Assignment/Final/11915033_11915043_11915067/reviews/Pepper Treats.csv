"16515184","Excellent range of Kerala food, and their various combinations is worth multiple visits. Don't miss Kanji-Payyar, difficult to see elsewhere. Decent service and seating. Love the local ambience with famous. Malayalam movie dialogue frame photos in English. Though not much crowded, seems to be a big hit with food orders considering the flow of swiggy. Also try the coconut pudding at the end. Much more to try in subsequent visits. Is a delight for non-vegetarians, but equally good options for vegetarians. ",5,"2019-05-05 13:56:03",29,11,0
"43366185","We ordered Malabar paratha, appams and Kerala chicken roast from this place. While appam and paratha were good, chicken was a little undercooked and the masala was raw and we had to throw the dish. We had dined here earlier and the food was good then. ",2,"2019-04-21 20:09:31",4,3,0
"36028917","I have never been to the place so can't say much on how the restaurant is in terms of ambiance and service. But have ordered couple of times via Swiggy.Have tried  few items here, had great expectations from the place based on it's rating on Zomato and other platforms, but sadly the food is pretty much average, nothing special about it.
This place could be tried once but not more than that.",2,"2019-04-10 23:45:43",27,21,0
"33852769","Have been eating at pepper treats for about a year now. All their food is really good. My favourites are fish curry meals , nadan chicken curry and buffalo roast ! üòä",4,"2019-04-01 20:34:17",5,82,2
"851467","I have been a regular at the Pepper Treats/ Trails for a couple of years. Only visited the place once, and been ordering UberEats/Swiggy almost once every week.¬†
First up, there is a huge paucity of Kerala restaurants around town. That itself bumps up the rating of this place by a star ;-)
The food is great - Kerala Chicken curry being my favorite.¬†
However, their quality can be a little in-consistent - there are days when the curry tastes a bit off, the appams too sticky, Kadala Curry a bit too stony. But then, there are days, when things are just perfect. Logic goes for a toss and a 5 Star rating beckons. :-)",5,"2019-03-20 14:58:09",5,114,0
"33340268","Ordered Veg stew and Appams which were really soft and tasty. Beef curry is good too. One should also try their pudding.
All in all hearty and satisfying food. ",4,"2019-02-05 09:40:46",3,34,0
"2092760","We have very few Kerala restaurants in Hyderabad. Was happy to see one in Hitech area. Visited on Friday and liked it so much that visited next day again.
Tasted like authentic Kerala cuisine. I especially liked malabar parotta and chicken curry, pazham puri(banana fry) and tender coconut pudding is a musy try.
Its not a big fancy ambience, pretty small setup but they have maintained it cleanly.
If one thing which can be improved is the quanity. Quantity in chicken curry was very less. Rest all was good.
Do maintain it.",4,"2019-01-27 13:31:49",11,3,0
"74720067","The worst food I have ever ordered from ZOMATO.Unfortunately,happened to order Alleppey Fish Curry and Kappa.I dont know how to explain it since I wonder how could people provide food in such a worst manner.The curry was a hell lot of MASALA WATER with 4 UNCOOKED FISH PIECES (for rs.331).Never had such a WORST experience from any of the restuarants EVER.And,I believe,this will be the last one.The kappa was also very bad.Now,its like a NIGHTMARE!.",1,"2019-01-26 20:23:54",1,1,0

"40607698","Ordered Buffalo Fry from Pepper Treats just now for rs 200. And when I received the package, I was surprised to see the little quantity . Considering the price of 1kg raw meat of 160rs, the amount of meat provided by them is
not even worth 50rs . Please don't order food from these money looters anymore and get cheated.",1,"2019-01-13 14:53:55",6,4,1
"52368238","Food was good here when they started but has changed since then. Veg meals is ok here. But non veg is below average. Their food sometimes taste good and most of the times not good. As per my experience 8 out of 10 times it was bad. Ordering online they would cheat you by giving small portions of the dish especially fish. I had called and asked them about it, but they were not willing to listen. If you are looking for good tasty kerala food this is not the place",2,"2019-01-12 23:16:20",1,1,0

"30119539","One of the best places in Gachibowli where you can get Kerala food. The manager says appam and puttu are the favourite among the customers. I tried meals, fish fry and fish curry. In my opinion, this was the best fish curry I've had in Hyderabad so far. It's really worth the price.
Their tender coconut pudding is also a must try.

"31160776","No offence, I don't think it is a great idea to have north east folks instead of Keralites in kitchen/service. Service quality is below par and the food taste does not taste authentic.

"50303984","Finding another state's food is quite a difficult task in Hyderabad. Looking for an authentic Kerala cuisine, I stumbled upon Pepper Trail.
A subtle ambience, quiet place tucked in the middle of a residential area and an IT park, this restaurant provides Malabar cuisine with a lot of options. Puttu Kadala has always been my favourite. The food doesn't disappoint you here. Be it puttu or meals they serve are fresh and tasty.
The staff are courteous but have very less knowledge about the food they are serving. suggest the management do something about it.

"29157330","It is small restaurant and always busy. And you know why they are busy after you try their food. After our first visit, we went back there time to time whenever we are in Gachibowli side of the city. On our first visit, we ordered Fish Meals, fish fry and chicken roast. We thought that the paratha is the softest paratha in the city. Fish fry and chicken roast was ok but the fish curry was very tasty. We didn‚Äôt impress much about the side vegetables and we wished that they put thoran or avail but we were happy to find this place. On our second visit, we didn‚Äôt go for Meals but we ordered biriyani, fish curry, veg stew, paratha and coconuts pudding. We were expected the typical Malabar style of biriyani but it was similar to the one we eat at home. The coconuts pudding was awesome and we ended up eating two each and we ordered two extra to take it home. On our third visit we ordered fish curry as usual and Avial which we spotted on the board as a today‚Äôs special menu. We enjoyed everything thoroughly that day. We are planning to order something different like fish moole and prawn etc. next time and we are looking forward to it. ",4,"2018-09-15 20:24:32",60,114,4

With Service boys, you would have to confirm that they noted the same dish which you asked for. It seems they are not familiar with Malayali tastes..
Well, Portraits on the wall with dialogues taken from Sreenivan, Lalettan and Mamootty's movies do compensate for this..

I only pray that they maintain the quality and also the cleanliness that I saw today. Request the owners to sustain the cleanliness of the washroom and the wash basin which normally descends over a period of time. One input regarding the Kerala rice which was served today on meals.- I personally believe that it should be more cooked/boiled. Please rectify this otherwise you will be thoroughly mistaken for a tactic that you are deploying to prevent seeking of more rice during the meals. Except that single point, we enjoyed it!

"399898","Those having hard time finding authentic Kerela cuisine ,can definitely hit this place . The experience in terms of fine dining may not be perfect but the food prepared by them is surely gonna make you like the simplicity here .
We being vegetarians ,that feature little less in Kerela coastal cuisine ,were convinced to adventure into new south indian cuisine. Kerela is new to us and the exepreice like this has brought respect and love for Kerela cuisine from us .
We started with appam and veg korma .veg korma is more like lill sweet Thai curry I have had imbibed in the goodness of coconut milk (4.5/5) .appam is a bread made of rice (4/5).
We then went ahead with ordering Malabar paratha and kadala curry.malabar paratha is like laccha paratha ,famous in North India (4/5) and kadala curry is made of chana and veggies which is decently spicy (4/5)
For sweet dish we relished coconut pudding (5/5) which was made of pure cream extracted from raw coconut ,which drooled us for more .
The restuarant is not very cheap for its offerings .I could easily pay the same amount if curtlery ,crockery ,ventilation and sitting arrangement were taken care properly .
Recommendation- go here for food only and don't expect much regarding good ambeince .",4,"2018-08-04 16:15:23",138,817,6

The food was just average, also ordered a appam which tasted sweet and bought down my rating from 4 to 3.
The ambience looks good which could seat about 20-30 people, overall an average experience .",3,"2018-06-14 14:10:04",76,497,4
