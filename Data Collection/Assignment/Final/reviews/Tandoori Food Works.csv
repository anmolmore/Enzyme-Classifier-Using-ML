"40704104","Very pleasant experience at TFW. The stuffed tangdi kabab was fantastic. Succulent, mildly flavoured and a great salad to go with it. The sizzler biryani was a great innovative touch right down to the well cooked cabbage base. It added a new twist to the term biryani. Definitely a must visit.",4,"2019-05-14 21:09:16",4,1,0
"44586620","Ordered chicken tikka from here. Never had itna oily chicken tikka in my life. The oil was dripping uncontrollably from the box, the packing was bad. The naans were full of oil, the plastic was full of oil, the sabji was so spicy that we could not finish it. Basically waste of money. ",2,"2019-05-12 23:54:15",31,21,0

"47676142","Order regular paneer tikka briyani from this place which costs rs 250/-. The briyani was good but the paneer was not so fresh and the quantity was very less. It just fills one person stomach, if someone's appetite is high then they would regret if they order food from this place.
There were two sizes, small (Rs:160/-) and regular (rs:250/-). Obviously one would think that small fills one person and regular would fill two. But No!
Very disappointed with the portion of food that they serve.
The Raitha was really tasty!! I hope they increase the portion for the amount they charge. ",3,"2019-03-26 02:33:35",83,145,1

We ordered Tandoori Tofu and Paneer tikka Biryani. They said that they are their chef special dishes. But they are not so special.
