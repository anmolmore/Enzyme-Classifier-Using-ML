"2582902","One day after I gave a 5* for this restaurant for chicken nuggets, they give me the world's worst nuggets coupled with masala fries. The quantity of fries was half of what was delivered just a day before and th nuggestd were soggy I mean worst soggy you have ever eaten. Avoid this stupid restaurant that changes quality on every order. I just hope they maintain some hygene in their kitchen.",1,"2018-07-22 11:53:22",3,0,0
