"260150","the rating is such because of the name
we had thought it was like an american grill restaurant
shocked by the indian spread 
food was ordinary 
no choice in red meats and no grill
pls change the name, gives out the wrong idea",2,"2019-05-04 18:08:41",34,35,0
"478838","I was on a work in financial district and it happens to be lunch time, so finalised this place after some search, i parked my car outside and walked inside it was completely empty, as i enter into AC dining hall, man o man full of crowd, I literally waited for 15 minutes to find a table, as the staff is completely busy with existing orders not the new customers, so yeah, service needs to be improved. After finding a table i ordered jeera rice and kodi vepudu, liked the jeera rice alot and chicken was also good, next time i’ll try some more. Recommended place if you are a telangana cuisine lover.

"1509883","Good out door sitting restaurant to spend some pleasent evening time. Visited this place which to close to outer ring road and nankaramguda IT offices. It's a quite and less crowded to have Andhra style spicy food. We ordered babycorn manchuria, chicken lollipop and chicken biryani. Food was bit spicy but manageable and good. Chicken was well cooked and tasty. Quantity was bit less when compared to it's price range and it's compititers. But still it can be miantained well
Quality: 4/5
Quantity:3/5
Price range : 3.5/5 (5 means it's costly)
Service:3/5

"67437544","Useless.. They serve alakarte items as ""prasadam"" and empty customer pockets. It's not worthy. Quality and quantity is poor. Once you visit then you will never visit there in your life time. I dont recommend other customers to go here. Jaagao grhak jaago.. ",1,"2019-04-17 23:28:46",7,7,0
"15754473","Since this place is close to my office and they serve South Indian delicacies, I’ve decided to go there with my team. This place has got that simple dhaba vibe and the food they serve is lip smacking. If you are non-vegetarian, this place is a must try.  Also, if you are here- do eat their Kadhu ka kheer in desserts. Ever since I’ve tried that, I  ensure that I order this every time I go there and recommend this to friends and this one has never let us down. ",5,"2019-04-09 09:42:46",29,109,0
"1454847","Me & my friend we're looking for quick lunch on a Friday noon in Financial Dist and we spotted this place. Decided to venture as this will be our first visit.
It's was exactly at 12.30 noon when we entered restaurant and found there was hardly any one. Outside landscape, place for sitting is very good. There is in-house place with AC as well. We chose inside as it was already too hot. Ambience is descent and nothing very special, but is good.
Food we kept it simple as Nawabi Chicken Kebab which was special on the day we visited and Chicken Biryani. Kebabs were really nice. Biryani was like fine. Not so very delicious at same time it's not bad. Service is fast.
While if you ask me will you visit the place again, I might start thinking as I found place outside more interesting than the food. That does not serve purpose. So, I am sure you got answer.
Interesting was by time the clock ticked 12.45noon, my goodness entire place was filled with people and many we're waiting... That made us think, probably there is something else special about this place which we didn't order... So if at all I go there next time will see to it I taste it... 😀",3,"2019-03-08 22:24:51",78,76,1
"16588162","We always use to order their kodi pulav  (which tastes sooo good few times  and just okay some other times) on zomato but recently we visited this place to have dinner 
So we ordered chicken manchow soup which was okay okay in taste cuz manchow noodles are not fresh since i could smell the oil in noodles... but quantity of chicken in soup was good ! 
Kothimeera kodi pulav (suggested by the server) is actually pretty tasty but i wish there was little more kothimeera in it ... taste was very good though..prices are little high",3,"2019-02-26 16:24:39",22,10,0
"48841449","T-Grill is on the main road next to ICICI campus in the Financial Dist, spread over an acre it has both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is midst of neatly done green lawns with small and large hut shaped structures.
We started with Grilled fish that was Basa/Cod fillet skewered upon coals; it was spicy and tasted well with green dahi chutney. The Paya shorba/soup was extremely spicy but very tasty.  Then we had Kottimira Chicken, Mutton Dalcha with Bagara Rice for the main course that came as a recommendation. Pachipulusu with the Bagara Rice also tasted awesome. On the whole, all the dishes we tasted there were awesome except for the heat from the spice!
Authentic Telangana and Andhra Signature dishes! Will definitely try again for the rest of the menu recommendations!",4,"2019-02-14 12:15:58",13,21,0
"29127397","Third class attitude, rude staff, pathetic food is what defines this place. Good luck if you happen to stall here by mistake.

"169311","This restaurant never fails to dissapoint me. This time Ordered chicken biriyani from Zomato and this is what I got just bones and fragments . Upon complaining to the restaurant manager made fun of me saying I am trying to con him as I might have already finished the chicken or hidden it and now trying to get more for free. Asked me to complain in Zomato and that's exactly what I am doing. ",1,"2019-02-04 16:36:34",5,6,1

"35259496","This place is not exactly vegetarian-friendly. They cook everything in the same dish and I'm guessing they use the same oils. Did not eat here but thought people would like to know.
Service is quick for the starters. They took some time for the main course.
Friends say the food is alright.
There's outdoor and indoor seating. Place is clean throughout and it looks like the hygiene is good.
Gets really busy in the afternoon because it's so close to the IT hub. ",3,"2019-02-01 14:29:33",5,4,0

Food is amazing except the oil quantity that they use. Prawns dishes were not that great. Only prawns starter i.e golden prawns were good.
Gongura chicken is amazing.
Service is very fast.
Would not recommend lassi at this place as its not the proper one. It's very watery and tasteless.
Management is pretty cool and open to feedback...they humbly accepted the fault in dishes and replaced them.
Can be improved a lot. Would surely pay a visit again. ",3,"2019-01-08 21:11:30",105,1869,7

"36387823","One of the best places I have been to this winter, perfect ambience and what I loved the most was
to beat the cold they provide a hot charcoal basket beside every table..gives you the perfect winter warmth, even on a busy day of the week the service was on spot, just like a Dabha where everything seemed to be on the move and full of buzz 🙂 the food was always known to be typical Telangana food but somehow felt it was a little close to Telangana cusine and more of a quick Dabha serve..loved the ragi sangati combo perfect bowl of rangi sangati with a dollop of ghee with 4 accompaniments like mutton pickle, chicken curry, daal and pachi pulusu, ordered their famous pulavs as well.
Ambience : 4.5 (stole my heart with the charcoals)
Taste : 3.5 (would love more authenticity)
service: 4
Quantity : 3 (can improve a little for the price point)
Value for money : 3 (maybe because it is located in Gachibowli)
Overall rating for this place a decent : 4/5",4,"2018-12-30 20:21:02",57,51,4

"2758276","I was looking forward to have good time & enjoy some good tandoori food. I liked this place with my previous experience have been very good.So was looking forward for the same. Reached this place, got a seat which had full of mosquitoes.I can't argue much of it as it was a open space, but they dint attempt to place a mosquito coil. The service guy was least attentive. We needed to search him to place the order .So ordered tandoori chicken boneless, harabara kebab n veg pulav.The very first bite but tears in my eyes as it was very very very spicy & harabara kabab's spice level so beyond my imagination.We just couldn't eat it. We asked them no make the pulav least spicy. But this one was like a bomb. We all went to have a good time but dint get anything of this sort. Will never try this place again.

"48353445","My friend ordered the Ulavacharu Chicken Bone Pulao from T-Grill. The price was high, but the taste justified it. It is one of the spicier foods I tried in Hyderabad. I always though Hyderabadi food was spicy. But, I never came across anything very spicy. This one was spicy enough to be memorable. It's one of the best pulaos I've ever had.

I've not seen anyone come here to try their Chinese and vegetarian as I don't think it would stand out at all. But again, their bheja fry, their iguru, their kheema and the meats that they have are amazing!!! Their bagara rice along with the kheema and mutton iguru was too too good.

"33503433","Ordered a nice dinner for two from T Grill. The prices are mediocre and I placed my order late night via Uber Eats. Following is my experience-:
Service- The parcel came in around 10 minutes later than estimated. The delivery boy called once he was outside our society. 3/5
Presentation/Packaging- It was a usual packing. Nothing extraordinary nor anything bad about it. 3/5
Food- Food was fine but what really killed my appetite for it was the amount of chillies added. We tried the following-:
Paneer Pulao- It had a nice quantity, sufficient for two. There were average number of paneer pieces. It tasted quite yum. The masala was ample inside. Too spicy which killed it's essence. 3.5/5
Gobi 65- A good quantity for two, it tasted like a typical fried Gobi. Nothing extraordinary, the usual. 3/5
Will I order from here again? I will only if they decrease the spice level. Despite mentioning it clearly as an extra special instruction, it was supremely spicy which made me fill my stomach with water.",3,"2018-07-08 16:16:56",316,1157,2

"395709","A randomly sudden decision took me and a couple of my colleagues to this place on a weekday lunch. we were unsure of our choice when we saw a few people sitting under the open huts and dining in the heat wave. But the moment I opened what seemed like a kitchen door, I was thrown aback to see 100s of people belting some South Indian meat. Man, this place is an oasis in the Puppalguda desert!
We being mutton lovers, ordered a nalli starter and charcoal mutton chops. looking at the crowd we were mentally prepared to go back to office in the evening post chai break but the waiter promptly brought the food in less than 10 minutes with a scalpel like tool with which we were to operate the nalli. Our eyes shone. The nalli did not disappoint us. we then dug into the chops. all my hours spent in drooling at pork ribs on YouTube were redeemed. this mutton chops did the deed. the meat wasn't the slimy, fatty kind melting off the bones, but was the perfectly grilled meat willing to separate from the ribs at our mildest effort. we were already dreaming of another plate but decided against it in the best interests of our bellies. then came the main course - rotis, mamasam pachadi and chicken biriyani. first bite of the mamasam pachadi threw our chairs back by 5 feet. we decided to ask the waiter to pack the biriyani and order another round of rotis to honour the pachadi. for a person who consciously keeps away from gongura chutneys, this one which clearly had gongura was just perfectly sour - a bit more sour and I wouldn't have cared to write this review. the meat was invisible. we had to spot a narrow bone in the pachadi to even know there was mutton. it was just mystically Omni present in the meat. I guess this is what you would call divine food.

"260869","On the way back home from Mrugavani National Park, had a stop here for lunch. I really felt the present state of this place like lot of things gone missing. First impression, no one at the parking to guide or coordinate it, all were parked zigzag, welcomed by foul odour at that point.
Huge place, but no one seem to let us know of how to proceed further, like where to sit or dine, especially if it was first time like me. Initially noticed an outdoor seating, organized perfectly under hut shape units spread across the whole area with vibrant chairs and tables. Felt like scorching sun breeze wouldn't make us withstand it for quite long and so thought not an good idea to have lunch outdoors, also felt kitchen exhaust smoke widespread. No one cared to guide until I personally asked of any indoor is available.
So shifted to inside dining room, great relief finding at a corner a place for us. Our order was Veg platter - not worth price, taste, quantity. Jumbo chicken Biryani - evenly cooked, tender chicken, not so flavorful, Mutton Biryani is good.
Service lag, may be of huge rush. Missing fine dine features, asked for finger bowl but got an answer to wash hands outside.
Village back drop artifact, greenery are little bit saviors. May be at evening hours, outdoor seating could be good choice. Anyway no thrill at T grill.",3,"2018-03-15 11:22:37",103,2829,3

However the food was ok. You can visit this restaurant once to just have a taste of the dishes. I still wonder why most people prefer t-grill despite all its negatives. 👎

"41166977","Worst experience in sense of service. We came to this place group of 9 people. They were taking forever to take the orders. We received piece of hair in one of the starter. We had to seek the people to take our orders. Quantity of all the starters was very less. Every time we needed to ask them to serve. They were leaving the starters just like that on table. All the dishes were average or can rate them below than that as well. None of them was extraordinary. Waiting for main course was more than 30 mins. ",2,"2017-12-22 19:32:44",2,2,0

Been to this pace for lunch,
Place is huge with good outdoor seating.
Ordered chicken corn soup, boneless chicken kebab, chicken and mutton biryanis.
Chicken corn soup is ok.
Chicken kebab, soft and tender, tastes good, which is worth a try.
Mutton biryani is ok.
Cons : no proper service and waiting time is more.

Food I should say is not so appealing...very tough to recommend or think of any standout...Butter Roti is good in breads
Service is good I should say...
Let's talk about Don't Trys:
Manchow Soup
Mushroom Starters (as a mushroom fan..disappointment)

"30785857","Had heard a lot about the place. So finally decided to make a visit specially because it was quite close from our place. It's very spacious with lot of fresh air and tables at quite a distance from  each other. The staff is very courteous and quick. 
Now coming to the food the paya soup was horrible, but the staff was quick to replace it and suggest a better option which was really good. 
Nice rotis and tasty biryani. The star of the evening was the methi chicken.  Extra ordinary flavour and a very different taste. Definetly to be tried.
One place on my list which I know is reliable.",4.5,"2017-11-26 18:35:57",21,17,0
