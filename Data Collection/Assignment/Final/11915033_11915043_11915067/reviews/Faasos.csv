"34251417","What did I order?
I ordered Reshmi Chicken Kebab Wrap, Cheese Melt Chicken Wrap & Chicken Rice Feast
What was good?
Food arrived on time and was hot.
Neatly packed.
They have used reusable container for the rice and recyclable carton box(small) for the wraps
Attractive packaging.
Above all, the Taste. The products tasted real good.
I feel the cheese üßÄ on my mouth when I was having the cheese melt wrap. Chicken was tender and cooked real soft. They are boneless and hence facilitated smooth process of eating them. Wrap was cooked equally good.
Reshmi Chicken Kebab Wrap was awesome. It gave a different taste altogether. 
Highlight was the rice though the wraps were equally good. Rice was cooked with real long basmati rice and the masala mix was at the right proportion. It can be had by both - children and elders. They have two differential cooked chicken on the top. Both are boneless and cooked with perfection. Only the ingredients differ.

Honestly, my excitement dropped down after tasting the parathas, as they were too greasy. Paneer curry, on the other hand, was the savior, Vadas were fine and Kheer was up to the mark. What I liked about the thali was that it had more than enough food for 1 person. I am going with 2 stars as the parathas are the base of this thali and I¬†couldn't finish even half of it. I have very high expectations from Fassos and am sure they will take this feedback well and improve on the quality of parathas.",2,"2018-11-15 18:25:26",81,196,0

Ordered the Singhada aloo paratha and panner makhanwala meal.
The packaging and the presentation was very nicely done.
The singhada aloo parathas were nicely baked and tasted really good. The spices in the parathas were less but that's according to my preference.
The paneer makhanwala was creamy and tasty. It was neither too spicy nor too sweet, it had just the right taste and aroma.

"30307683","I just love the wraps of Faasos and can have them at any time .I mainly like their three wraps - Cheesy corn salsa wrap,Mac n Cheese wrap and Veg pizza wrap. All of them are amazing but Pizza wrap is just mind blowing.They have multiple options for the bread of the wrap as well - multigrain, crispy bake,lacha Parantha etc.
Pizza wrap has cheese, vegetables and other sauces in it. It gives you a feel of both wrap and pizza and tastes amazing.The size is big and is good enough as a meal for one person
I have also tried chola kulcha and Veg thali from Faasos but in Bangalore,they were also very good.
I have tried almost all of their major wraps :
Pizza Wrap (5/5)
Mac n Cheese wrap (4.5/5)
Cheesy corn Salsa(4/5)
Aloo wrap (3.5/5)
Jumbo Veg wrap(3/5)
Egg wrap (3.5/5)
Paneer Tikka Wrap (3.5/5)
Rajma Chole is also very good.
Desserts:
I recently tried their Red Velvet cheese cake and it was also mind blowing and definitely worth a try!!It was one of the best red velvet cheese cake,I have ever had
Red velvet (5/5)
Raspberry Cheesecake shot(4.5/5)
Chocolate Fantasy (4/5)
Must try their wraps and especially Pizza wrap!!!",5,"2018-11-04 11:43:02",179,1874,12

"1573699","Zomato has asked me to be polite.. ok.. Faasos is delightfully bad in its food quality... When you order a pizza roll.. they not only bake it like a pizza but they take it to the next level of master culinary skills... They roast it till the end.. just like how your mumma used to make it.. and best part comes next.. Faasos excels in giving surprises and since they handle their own delivery you can never know when your food is going to arrive... It's too much fun to see that status - ""Food is being prepared"" , ""Your food is in the kitchen"".. and they won't update it because the delivery person can come any moment to your doorstep and say Surprise.. In my case they were quick enough to deliver it in only 1 hour 30 minutes... So fast da.. then I remembered food should have been delivered only in 40 minutes... I asked delivery person why so much late da.. He said sir we were cooking your roll property that's why it took time.. open it and try it sir.. you would have never seen such roll.. And he was right.. I never saw the roll only charcoal.. ( attached picture for reference )",1,"2018-11-02 02:13:53",2,21,1

I ordered sabudana meal and it was super awesome to get the special thali delivered in the navratri season with all the ingredients as needed for the fast. The packaging was good and the order was delivered on time. The thali has sabudana khichdi with loads of potato and peanuts ,curd, sabudana kheer, paneer makhni and a pumpkin chatpata chutney kind of curry. Everything tasted good just that the makhni didn't go with the meal. There could be rotis as well and the portion of khichdi cud be decreased. The taste was no doubt best. Fasoos has been doing great in terms of bringing the festivities and food together. It was a little expensive though but it's worth it.üòÄ Unique menus are always welcome.

Got a chance to review their Navratri special menu and chose their royal navratri meal which came in a neat packaging with Singhada ke aloo parantha,paneer makhanwala,sabudhana ki kheer,green tomato curry and curd. Best part was paneer makhanwala , it was perfect and exactly with no onions and garlic suitable for Navratri and then the rare and filling part was paratha üéâ The meal is completely fills your stomach after a whole day of fasting!

Cheesy melt paneer wrap was outstanding...Cheese was busting in mouth with each bite..paneer and gravy was really tasty..It has Punjabi flavor with cheese combination..Loved it..
Paneer wrap - It was average in taste as the gravy was little bland and plus it has cheakpea curry which annoyed me a lot.. taste was not good..

I got a cheese paneer roll and a paneer tikka masala roll to review.
If you've to order one among the two go for the paneer tikka masala roll. It had right amount of spices. The cheese paneer roll was too bland. It had just a lot of cheese and paneer but no spices to make it tasty.
The quantity was good enough for one. Would have loved it even more if they would have made cheese and masala as a combination.

Cheese melt paneer wrap - 3/5 had too much of cheese, although sprinkled with the spicy masala it tasted fine, but in comparison to the one above I expected something of equivalent taste to my tongue.

"831269","First things first.... Faasos have always been the first name that comes to mind when it comes to huge sized Appetite fulfilling wraps.
I haven't come across any other place which delivers these kind of huge juicy warps with this amount of filling.
Tried their cheesy chicken jumbo wrap and chicken jumbo wrap and believe me you'll be full to your throat with just one wrap. Besides the quantity they also maintain quality with the wraps being flavourful and cheesy üëåüëå
Overall if you are looking for NO SALAD only chicken wraps which are my kind of things faasos won't disappoint you for sure! ",4,"2018-07-14 20:20:15",294,1076,2

"47400557","Ordered pizza wrap with offer BOGO. Seemed like they splited one wrap into two. No sauces were added. Never had this bad experience with fasoos before. Surely there quality has degraded. One suggestion for fasoos - if you can not afford to provide offers to your customers, please do not. Stop fooling your customers.",1,"2018-07-13 01:45:49",3,4,0
"31265564","The wraps were so good, I had the jumbo chicken wrap and cheesey chicken delight
I personally recommend the jumbo chicken wrap, as the sauce's will be less
And if you love having the wraps bit juicy then go for the cheesey chicken delight",4,"2018-07-10 12:41:43",211,1574,0

I was a great fan of Kathi rolls but seldom you get proper authentic kolkata style. After me moving to Hyderabad from chennai I really missed this.... part of a review prog got to know about this faasos and decided to order Jumbo chicken wrap and cheesy chicken delight.
1st one is ok but not great, size is huge and can give a try
2nd one is a real Delight and name is justified, loved their seasonings and quality of wrap , almost matches to Kathi roll",4,"2018-07-05 13:51:44",78,214,1
"45345846","I wish Faasos would reconsider their prices. 150 bucks for an omlette and some meat??
I wouldnt say that your food is not tasty but your outrageous prices are driving me away.
- sincerely,
someone who would like to enjoy your sausage roll once again without having to take another loan. ",2,"2018-07-04 11:55:54",27,3,0
