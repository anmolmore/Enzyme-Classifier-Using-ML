"36583506","""Haleem Haleem Haleem""
Hello Peeps;
People Around Us Say Pista House , Pista House During Ramzan Just Because They Prepare Haleem well.
I Was literally Waiting For A Free Time To Go & Have Haleem .
Then Seeing The Very Big Queue Outside The Pista House I Decided To Go Home & Order.
I Ordered Mutton Haleem , Naan & Paneer Butter Masala.
Naan & Paneer Butter Masala Were Mouth Watering To Look At & Even Tasted Soooo Good!!!
Haleem Wasn't that excellent. It Was Ok Ok Because They Added A Lotss Of Spices Like Black Pepper & Cloves.
üëâüëâIt's Irritating When You Chew Haleem & Get Lots Of Cloves In Between When You Chew ( I hope You Understood, Lol)
Paneer Butter Masala : Quantity Was Sufficient For 5 Naans. I Would Rate 5 For The Taste. But I would Rate this Restaurant Upon Haleem Only.
Haleem Taste : As I Said , Not As Expected. It Was Just Ok. Cloves Spoiled My Cup Of Haleem.
I Will Still Give It A Try In Other Branches Of Pista House & Will Let You Know The Reviews. ",3,"2019-05-14 10:57:05",24,63,2

"103851257","If there could be an option of zero stars, I would definitely put it. It's a very bad experience ordering from pista house. The food is good, but service is very slow, pathetic and bad. The managers and people managing speak blatant lies over calls for a order on swiggy.
They constantly make the delivery guy wait with false words to both the customers and the delivery partner.
If running a hotel business is so difficult, maybe a change in management would help. Completely ruining the name and brand of pista house. ",1,"2019-04-01 19:04:07",1,0,0

2.¬† Service¬† : Ok.¬† the person who took the order did promptly mention how much time a dish will take to be served, it is good to be prepared
3.¬† Food : OK to Pathetic.¬† we had some starters Paneer Tikka was good and other ones were ok and from my friends who had Tandoori Prawns their Opinion was not so good.¬† After the starters the Disaster came in the name of EGG Biriyani.¬† We had ordered for 2 Egg biriyani,¬† there was no Flavour, gravy or taste in that, it is just a coloured biriyani rice with Fried Boiled Eggs. See the Photo.¬† It didnt end here, we gave a feedback the Waiter promptly took the bowl back to get some masala in it, and came back and served with masala which was Chicken pieces. Two of us dont eat chicken or meat and it was served on our plates.¬†¬†
We ended up not eating that second bowl of biriyani except for few spoonful, we were charged for that biriyani, after some discussion they reduced the¬† price of 1 biriyani from our bill.

"12345181","Went for a team lunch. The place is opposite Care Hospital. 
Ambiance
This place has normal ambiance as all the other Irani hotels.  The problem is that there are a lot of Swiggy delivery boys and they waiting outside the door to collect their parcels. We felt bad sitting there while they were  peering inside in the hot sun and us eating there.
Food quality
We ordered three items
1. Devils Chicken
: Chewy chicken coated. This was the best dish of the lot
2. Tandoori Chicken
: fully burnt, coated with ghee to hide the bad quality
3. Premium Biryani: This was really bad. When people go to a Irani style hotel, there are some expectations. We like Biriyani dum cooked. This particular Biriyani costed 650  and came in a slightly large bowl. Please be careful as this can only serve 3 people.  The Rice was passable and the Biriyani was fully mixed..... Not the layering like it is supposed to be. It textured  like a pulao with the masala . The chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off... You can tell that is was stale. The Chicken pieces were only bones. the mutton pieces were not existent. 
This looks like a outlet which is run by fake people. 
Biryani and food items in traditional hotels like Paradise, Shah Ghouse, Mehfil, Shahdab, Bawarchi are really good. The tandoori chicken will normally be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. 
The service took a long time in coming. It looks like they are short of staff.  People will go there by the name and feel bad. I feel the Pista house owners should look into quality and quantity issues. This outlet is making a fast buck in the Hitech area where floating population is heavy.",1,"2018-11-16 20:56:44",6,4,0

Ambiance-
Pista House has a long chain of restaurants in Hyderabad. This outlet is located in Gachibowli near South India Shopping Mall. Pista House is bakery and restaurant having a large number of take away products available. Ambiance is quite congested because they have restaurant in the central area of hall surrounded by bakery. Also they have separate party hall available for advanced reservation.
Food-
Pista house is mostly famous for it's bakery products. Also in time of Ramzan, they serve Haleem. Pista House serves Indian as well as continental food including Chinese, Italian. We ordered Chicken burger served with potato chips and ketchup, garlic bread, chicken tangdi kebab, angara kebab and Chicken Biryani. Both the kebabs were good in taste and quantity.

I personally love their salads(Chicken, tuna) as they are done with fresh ingredients and served well.
They need to work on their milk shakes and other shakes as they don't taste the way they look, the taste is bland for the shakes.
Another important concern is the pricing the price of items is different at different outlets, the same stuff at tolichowki is cheaper compared to the Gachibowli branch.",3,"2018-09-10 13:07:58",179,1593,0

"40319532","Apart from its good quality Haleem, what also stands out is their Chicken Burger. I love the taste and the generous size of the burger bun.
We usually eat Chicken burger from this place and the taste never disappoints.
Chicken burger is stuffed with minced meat, few veggies like tomatoes and nice white sauce.
Haleem of course is the one we try during festive season. Overall its a good bakery for snacks & cakes.",4,"2018-08-08 05:08:15",231,406,1
"196074","I am so disappointed with what I just had today from Pista House, Gachibowli, that I don't think it would be sensible on my part to even award a single star rating, but unfortunately, zomato is not allowing me to publish the review without rating , hence this 1 star.
I have had Mutton Kheema Biriyani earlier from Pista House - Kondapur & Nizampet, both of which were awesome and of the same taste & make, however, the same didn't turn true for Kheema biriyani from the Gachibowli outlet.¬† All my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion, so, I am not being overly critical at all. I don't understand, how such reputed brands/chain do not maintains consistency of taste & recipe across all the outlets, they do maintain consistency with the prices though..
Not sure, if Pista House would be be even interested to take this comment seriously OR act upon it to get things better for next time, but, at least I request that they don't cheat on their customer's expectations.
What was bad with the biriyani -
1. It was all rice and no kheema
2. This is NOT at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets (Nizampet & Kondapur)
3. Trivial though - but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets ( while other outlets packs in Container , Pista House - Gachibowli deliver in foil packet )My order details -
Through Swiggy Order No: #16352555425, 2 portions of supposed to be Kheema Biriyani .

"4064611","Heard a lot about the place and had clean and nice food delivered at home. So I finally decided to pay a visit to the place myself. (High Expectations)
The place was nowhere near what I had imagined. The restaurant wasn't a very neat and hygienic place, the plates were dirty and the cutlery and sauce storage boxes tainted and dirty. The people there were not welcoming too and their uniforms were half tucked in.
Moving on to the good part, the food was cleaner than most non veg places in Hyderabad with the Chicken having a little less oil than most places. The desserts looked sumptuous (even though I was full for them, I manged to take some pictures of them)
So from now on I am just going to get myself a delivery from that place rather than actually going there and if I go there, it would be for the sole purpose of trying out the desserts! ",3,"2018-07-28 02:57:16",51,3370,8

"35912758","Pista house‚Äôs haleem is what I look forward to always. On a vacation to Nizam‚Äôs Hyderabad, we thought we will try one of their chicken dishes and thus chose:
Dum ka Murg & Tandoori roti.
A little above average food and overly filled staff who made it a little rushed up dining experience. Didnt get time to breathe coz the staff kept coming to check on you. No doubt thei service was prompt but at times felt it was too prompt. They should give customers little time to breathe to order food and finish it with peace. 
Next will try their haleem and some desserts too. ",3,"2018-07-15 23:48:24",204,2418,2

Their biryani is famous so no doubt the biryani was exquisite!
Service was on point! And the sweets were too yumm.. The double ka meetha and mango malai are the best among them!

Always knew about their Haleem and was surprised to taste their mughai range. 
The food was delicious and quite easy on pockets. The place is divided into two sections, inside there is a private eating space good for families. The quality and quantity of the food was satisfying. 
The dessert range in the bakery section was yummy and delicious. 
The staff was friendly and super-fast. 
You definitely can try this one when you‚Äôre around this area be it for a quite bite or proper spread.",5,"2018-06-20 22:30:39",38,92,0

I was here for dinner with friends during Ramadan to try their Haleem and gorge on some Mughlai delicacies they offer.
When I entered the place it was packed with people in queue waiting to be seated. 
Coming to the food, I totally loved their Malai Chicken and Pathar ka gosht. Juicy and tender. Their Haleem was yummy too.¬† I ended up trying their bakery section and wasn't disappointed either.
The desserts like dry fruit kheer and mulberry cream bowl was amazing and we had party in our mouths.
However, there's definitely room for improvement in the hospitality front and this will a big hit with families.

But what arrived was disappointing. The roti was hard to chew, the sauce was different, very less filling, too much pepper, rolls was filled more with lettuce than chicken. All this after paying 50% advance a day before and 50% on the day before collecting order and there was no discount given as well. When I called the concern person, he just said sorry it wont happen again, but I am not going to order again from here. Not reliable place for big orders.
Would not suggest this place for bulk orders. Cannot depend on this place!",1,"2018-06-13 11:47:36",2,60,1

"1325396","Happened to be here for iftar with friends this Ramadan. First I thought this place only offers bakery items, then came to know that it also offers fine dinning also.
Ambience:
Regarding the ambience, it's just fine nothing to complain about. But like its other branches which do have background music .That was not here. If it was the dining experience would be much great.
Service:The service was top notch. I don't know how they were able to manage the crowd of Haleem and dinning also. As we all know craze of Haleem during Ramadan.
Food:
We started off with their season specialty i.e. Their Haleem which was just great then came Their 8 treasure Chicken soup which had the right quantity of veggies and chicken can make any ones meal scrumptious .Murgh Malai Tikka which was just awesome can‚Äôt describe it in words but that‚Äôs a sure thing to try followed by Egg Spring Rolls, Chicken Tikka, Pathar Ka Gosht and Taipei Chicken.
All of them were delicious.
In mains we had their noorjahani chicken with Butter Naan which had rich creamy gravy. Was really delighted with taste. Then had their zafrani biryani which was good.
Deserts : Deserts are the thing which is much need for dinner and this place offers a variety of it and they are really good at it.Tried Mulberry Kheer , Dry Fruits Kheer , Rabdi Malai , Mixed Fruits Rabdi , Rainbow cake , Kaddu ki kheer ,Double Ka Meetha .all of them are good but Out Of them I liked Mulberry Kheer Rabdi Malai and Double ka meetha .
Many people know this place for their Haleem and bakery items but one must try their north Indian and Mughlai dishes .Overall budget friendly place.",5,"2018-06-12 18:20:35",36,699,8
