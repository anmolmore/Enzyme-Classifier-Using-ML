"39318678","Being a biker myself I love this concept of BBQ on the bike. The setup is basically a Royal Enfield bullet which has a grill attached to it as a motorcycle side car. The slow cooked grilled chicken and the sauces are yum. This place is surrounded by plenty of food trucks with a good crowd hence no disappointment with respect to the ambience. More seating and more options on the menu would have been nice. ",4,"2018-03-11 14:58:48",10,16,2
"2816136","The barbecue sauce is out of the world! The slow patient grilling of the chicken cooks it so well, this has to be one of the best chicken strips and wings ever. A little pricy maybe compared to the market around, but this is not worth missing. Too tempting and too much of finger licking good!",5,"2018-03-10 00:32:37",142,352,2

"544627","Love this concept. Love the chicken here.
Claiming to be India's first BBQ Bike, this food bike (?) serves barbecued chicken and pineapples barbecued on a grill attached to the bike. The people serving are nice and polite. Their chicken strips are just the right amount of spicy, the dip served with it is just the right amount of sweet. And unlimited lemon to spritz on your barbecued chicken! Life is good.
