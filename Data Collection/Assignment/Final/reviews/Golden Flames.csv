"1460539","Tandoori starters were overcooked and the chicken starters are undercooked. Biryani has a different taste unlike Biryani it seems to be a flavoured rice. The items are not served hot as well.",1.5,"2017-04-04 12:49:09",42,146,0

"15843577","Visited this restaurant yesterday for lunch. This lunch will be remembered forever because of the pathetic food they served. Both a-la-karte and buffet are available, opted for buffet. It's very little menu in both veg and non veg sections. They served the same non veg starter as a second starter. Noodles are sticky. Biryani's are not at all good. Dal curry is saltless. Manager is giving a stupid reasons each time. ambience is ok. But Nobody is satisfied by food. Need lot of improvement in service, quality of food, cleanliness. ",2,"2017-03-18 12:37:41",6,35,0

"15592247","You'll be glad you skipped this restaurant. They just ruined my lunch hour with my team. Too loud music for a restaurant, unpardonable service quality and not so great or awesome food.  My bad - i should have relied on Zomato rating than go with random word-of-mouth.",1,"2017-02-23 15:13:30",6,22,0
"20385688","Hey Folks, 
Just three days back went to Golden Flames, Ordered Gloden Flames Special Briyani (With combination of Chicken, Mutton, and Prawns) but requested not to put Mutton and Prawns.  Biryani was good Little bit Spicy but Chicken was coated and oil is more.
Food- 3.0/5 
Ambiance- 2.8/5 
Service- 3.0/5 
Value for money- 3.0/5Spicy Biryani.............?  Try Once Golden Flames Special Briyani for a change.
Cheers...,

"27158923","Ordered Schezwan chicken, Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani and lemonade..
Schezwan chicken is too much oily and pieces are very hard to bite and asked them to re cook.
Again they given after 2 mins. Some pieces are fine and other half are hard.. 
Pieces in Chicken Biryani are fine and dry... Masala in Biryani might be left over one which is deep fried and didn't tasted well. Mirchi ka salan is bad which is not the normal one served with biryanis.
Lemonade is OK, saving grace for me is timely service and this is the new restaurant there is only other family with me while ordering food and no one there most of the time.
Overall I felt unlucky to have bad meal. :(",2.5,"2017-01-22 08:30:16",472,1301,3
