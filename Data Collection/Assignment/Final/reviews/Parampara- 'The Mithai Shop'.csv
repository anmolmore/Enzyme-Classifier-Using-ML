"34052635","They have a good variety of Namkeens and sweets. The time I was at Hyderabad I wanted to especially buy a sweet named - Poathrekullu and some dry fruits. The dry fruits were good but the sweet was kind of bland and not so good in taste. It‚Äôs just a one time try for all the different kinds of sweets here. Other sweets taste good but Pothrekullu doesn‚Äôt. I took dry fruit and Jaggery flavour of poathrekullu.
But well, you people can give ither sweets a try. ",3,"2019-04-01 01:02:30",75,182,0
"36263035","Parampara is a mithai shop that offers some good variety of sweets. It is a decent place to buys your sweets for any occasion. It also offers some snacks and chaats. A major play is on the looks and presentation. In my personal belief the price is a bit on the higher side. But again overall... just another mithai shop with more or less same sweets.",3,"2019-01-31 22:32:24",59,182,2

"43485501","We ordered for 13 rasagullas with a pickup service. The sold rasagullas are expired already and tasted like damaged food. Don't you have the minimum common sense to sold such kind of expired food items to the customers? At least you should crosscheck before selling it to the customers.",1,"2018-11-16 17:18:06",3,1,0

"10274701","Saw this place and thought of giving it a try.  Bought Rasmalai, Cadbury burfi and Motichoor laddoo. Got it packed and brought home. 
Rasmalai: it was stale, tasted horrible and the only thing I could do was to throw in the dustbin. 
Cadbury burfi: it was ok with traces of boiled sugar. Never have tased a burfi where it tastes like sugar
Morichoor ladoo: please visit north to know what is a ladoo. If it sticks in the mouth, that says all about the quality. 
Overall not a place to be recommended for sweets. 
There are a lot of other options available in the surrounding like Agra sweets, Burfi ghar. ",2,"2018-08-26 19:22:49",17,104,0

"2845436","Quality of sweets are so fresh. Very difficult to hold a motichoor laddu. It is that fresh. Tried Kaju specials and liked Kaju kathli and Kaju barfi. They should get patent for this. So yummy!On the Bengali front, we liked Cham-cham, just mouth watering. Anjeer pan is one more sweet that i liked most. Their chat is scrumptious as well. I need to change my residence because i cannot resist having sweets daily from Parampara and i'm afraid if i'll become diabetic. I would strongly recommend all to order sweets from here for all your occasions. After all, today's occasion is lifetime memory.
I'm sure you won't regret :)",5,"2018-08-03 14:36:44",1,85,0

"57621047","My Best Mithai Experience in the Gachibowli . The quality of sweets served here were good. I'd say neither extraordinary nor worst. It's good, the fit and finish of the sweets were very good but the taste when put them on our taste buds was so so.
I took single pieces of 3 different sweets to get an idea of what quality they serve. The taste should go high a lill bit to match the price quotient. While almond house and agarwala sweets put more efforts in serving better taste..olive should cope up a lill bit.",5,"2018-06-16 10:07:12",1,0,0

"27256000","Another new addition in the IT hub of Hyderabad - Parampara. Gachibowli has seen a lot of restaurants, bakeries, sweet shops springing up in the last few months. Parampara is one such place. But, in these hundreds of food establishments, some have hit the mark and haven't.
Parampara is conveniently located, opposite to SLN terminus mall, on the main road and it offers ample parking room for your vehicle. The interior is well done and the staff is hospitable. Only negative thing in the ambiance was that, the tables are never cleaned.
Coming to the food, it offers sweets as well as snack items like samosas, dal kachoris etc and all are reasonably priced.
Since it was my first visit, I only wanted to taste things. I started off with a corn samosa (Rs 20 for 2pcs), veg samosa (Rs 20), bellam rasmalai (Rs 35), malai peda (Rs 520 per kg) and a complimentary kaju sweet. The samosas were warmed and given. The veg samosa was huge and tasted quite good, but it was not made of ghee as in Tewari's of few other big sweet shops. The corn samosa had become soft, hence I didn't like it. I was hugely disappointed by the bellam rasmalai which didn't have even a tinge of jaggery in it. Absolutely no flavour of jaggery, no taste, it was just a hard simple rasmalai.
The complimentary sweet was good though. Staff is friendly.
Verdict: This place needs improvement and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone till they improve and I give it a second try.",3,"2018-02-12 23:20:01",93,71,0
"50809855","If you want the best of Bengali sweets and craving for best in class Rasmalai , do visit this place for sure. Their malai sandwich and Rasmalai are my favorite.¬†Great Hospitality and amazing sweets. Visit in day time to avoid frozen or harden core.",4.5,"2018-02-12 12:22:34",1,3,0
"31798351","This place has excellent Pav Bhaji.The Pavs are masala Pavs and the food tastes like the actual north Indian Pav bhaji unlike the rest of the places here in the city.",5,"2018-01-21 20:14:12",16,34,0
"14493011","The new opened Mithai shop in Gachibowli with a two storey building. It serves Chaats, Namkeens, Sweets & Mixtures.
I only tried only sweets , the very basic one, one Rasmalai and one Rajbhog.
Rajbhog could've been a little soft and less cold. Sweet content was ok. Taste was ok.
Rasmalai(looked weird, maybe the color) was medicore, nothing to brag about.
They should improve on both.
I was given to test one Kova mix laddu, cannot recall its name, it was delicious. Liked it.
The place is huge with golden lightings. Variety displays of sweets, Mixtures Namkeens and snacks. Even you can test few of the Mixtures from the display area.
Cost: same as all other sweet shops.
Cheers!",3,"2018-01-20 21:05:13",43,4611,6
