we ordered Special Chicken Shawarma, Chicken Shawarma and Roast Chicken. I respect food therefore I won't use harsh words.
All the three items were inedible. Shawarma was dry to the core.. Namesake amount of mayo, stiff and rubbery chicken. Roast chicken was tasteless  and didn't even had salt.
Please don't serve food which gives bad memories about the eating experience. It's really detrimental to Food.",1,"2018-05-11 00:48:10",19,70,0

The place isn't anywhere close to being fancy or anything, it's a roadside place near the DLF building in gachibowli. This place gives you the best dosa, idli, uttapam and vadas. The cheese paneer dosa is arguably the best ! You can also try the butter cheese dosa. Fried idli is a wonder you won't want to miss !! The uttapam is good and so are the vada.

Generally this place is crowded and open late nights due to which most of the people have their food outside the dine in area itself. If they can work on the interiors a bit and make a comfortable sitting area for all,they can do wonders.

Food: will satisfy your taste buds. I have hardly found the food to be stale. The dosa counter outside is my favourite though. The masala dosa that they serve is like no other place, that always forces me to keep coming back to this place. 
Ambiance and service: Nothing great in the ambiance, you'll find IT crowd flocking in huge groups from DLF offices even during the wee hours. The restaurant is usually open till 12:30-1 which is where it scores the most I believe. The dosa counter is always jam packed and you'll need to wait before your order comes.
