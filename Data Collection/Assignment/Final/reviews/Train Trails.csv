"40175379","The food was completely disgusting its dead spicy and i sucked it into the bin pls don’t this restaurant forever. I just came from a long journey around 2.45am I so hungry I wouldn’t able go out and find a restaurant because it’s raining out then decided to check on online orders but my bad luck I found this crapy restaurant i placed an order fry pice biryani. Once I received the food from delivery boy  started out having couple bites it’s too dead spicy we didn’t even touch that food again so pls consider this issue I hope return my money back or else I will make big issue 
Thanks ",1,"2018-08-27 04:15:37",2,1,0
"35965366","Found stone in the food, Told them about it. First they said it's impossible? Then after insisting politely on it, they admitted it and apologized and said that won't happen in the future. While the taste was quite decent their response to their mistake was less than ideal.",1,"2018-08-02 01:51:18",1,4,0

"51453887","Ordered food from swiggy.
Sorry i shouldn't be saying but, food is sh*t here .
Salty as hell.
Ordered prawn fry. Chapathi and special dal rice.
Prawn fry looks like home food, but hey guess what its salty salty. Quantity very less for the price.
Chapathi- i guess the cook might have had low BP or something and have made chapathi out of salt not flour. 
Dal rice- no taste to it .
Sorry guys but u need to change that cook or close ur restraunt prety soon.
Adding the pics of the crap food i had to throw.
Only nice thing to say is the packging.",1,"2018-03-03 01:56:56",50,167,1
"37319186","I was super hungry after a hectic day of work and I am a huge fan of Rice and spice. Since I am a vegetarian, I have ordered Muddapappu avakai annam at an odd hour of around 1 am and I was delighted with each bite of food. 
Taste, quantity, spice, and that aroma! Everyone in the cafeteria came to me to have a share of this amazing piece of food. I hope this quality never changes. By the way, the food was super hot & fresh! That's what hard working people want during late nights! Thank you! Great job TT!
I wish I had clicked few pictures, but I just relished enjoying my dabba!",4.5,"2018-02-28 20:18:15",7,4,0
