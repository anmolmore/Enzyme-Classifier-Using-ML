"51485293","The meals are priced at 50 rupees and the items offered are a bang for money. The quality is like one we have at home ,the fry is served only once and everything else is unlimited. The are also dishes like biryani and chicken curry and chicken fry. The biryani here is worth a try atleast once given the fact that it doest taste like the regular Hyderabadi Biryani. It's rich and flavorful and carries a distinct taste. Usually to crowded from 1-2 PM,but a 5 minutes wait would get you seated. ",4,"2018-11-15 09:02:09",8,2,0
"63146969","Felt like eating Andhra meal and here I was. Food is nice but sambhar and rasam were a real letdown. The pappu was nice. Overall its a place worth going if you want something very simple but refreshing.",3,"2018-10-10 23:39:24",5,1,1
"40217583","A nice place to have homely meals. The food served is hot and fresh. You get Non-veg items too apart from the regular rice and chapattis. The spice-level in food is not too high. More importantly the rates are low,making this the most preferred place for lunch for those who work at DLF , Gachibowli. Ambiance and Hygiene both are okay-okay.  The one big problem is you might have to wait in a long queue at lunch time as there are way too many people always eating here. Also, the bearers employed are few meaning unlike other mess,you may have to wait some time before the order gets to your table. Otherwise , all good because it's paisa-vasool here.",4,"2017-10-13 11:28:02",5,5,0

The food served here is simple,tasty and unlimited at a reasonable price. This place is over crowded during the afternoon due to many companies in the vicinity whose employees prefer to have a homely food rather than the masala food of the cafeteria.",3,"2016-07-16 23:59:39",55,153,6

"1749309","Tried meals 2 times. It's andhra style food. Rice, curries, Sambar, Curd. You can order side dishes like egg bhurji, omelette. Also non-veg biryani and curries also available. I had seen many people ordering non-veg varieties.  This place always crowded during lunch as its beside to TCS and DLF. 
Meals is for 50 and omelette for 20 rs. Food also worth for the cost.",3.5,"2015-11-06 20:54:28",71,105,0

"2036154","Some one who want to have a tummy full meals go for it. Though sometimes it has curries which may not look so interesting you will still feel happy with dal rasam sambar and with some gravy curry. Omlet here is OK OK. Haven't tasted any on non veg items.
When u order chapatti u will get surprised to see 2 big ones served which is just 30rs. So be prepared.

"3098622","I ended up visiting this mess by chance on request from one of my colleagues. Food is served hot. However, its setup is not healthy and if you're going in for biryani, then the masala has more oil than the actual masala. When its summer time, you have no water and hence may have to be little more cautious on the food you eat and please dont ever risk washing your mouth from the water kept near the wash basin. You never know the what will happen next, to you.",2.5,"2015-04-18 22:17:20",6,1,0
