I ordered it for me and a couple of friends when we were bored and looking for a simple snack and this is a great find.If you are looking for a fun snack when you are in gachibowli, try this for sure :)",3,"2018-09-20 11:01:07",97,97,1
"34552074","I ordered Mexican Cone Pizza. It took 20 minutes to get my order and it was just salad wrapped in dough topped with a pinch of cheese. Don't waste even a penny here.",1,"2018-08-29 20:39:46",1,43,0
"240089","I really really liked the place. It is a charmless on the road side outlet and had stopped while I was on the go.
New concept wherein pizza is served into an edible cone.
Had chicken pizza cone- delicious and really cheesy.
Chicken grilled sandwiche- it was flavorful, filling and at nominal price.
Must visit.",5,"2018-08-12 19:58:59",207,611,2
"7600871","My frequent visits to this place. Love the unique concept of pizza in cone shape which keeps the pizza for hot and fresh for long time. They also have burgers, sandwiches(grilled), wraps, milk shakes, mocktails, snacks, combo meals...All are at very reasonable price. One stop for many options in this area...",5,"2018-06-26 21:41:58",4,1,0
