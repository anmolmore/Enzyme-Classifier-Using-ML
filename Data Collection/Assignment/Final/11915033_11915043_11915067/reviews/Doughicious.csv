"30536077","For my husband’s birthday this year I didn’t wanted to just order some cake and was scanning facebook. Interestingly came across Doughicious page and thought of trying the cupcakes by customizing. I contacted Madhuri and provide her all the information, but was amazed when i saw the picture of the cupcakes. My husband was surprised though, he had a thought that customize cakes and cupcakes doesn’t taste good. After having his first bite, he was like where is this place that you order these. I am surely going to order stuffs from here.",4.5,"2018-08-20 15:14:43",7,26,2

"39283375","I had an amazing experience with doughicious. There cakes are absolutely wonderful . I ordered a small chocolate truffle cake and was highly satisfied. Everyone loved the cake. Absolutely soft and not like those watery cakes.the frosting was yum. And the decoration on the cake was spot on. I just asked for a simple truffle cake and gave the baker Madhuri one simple quote to write on the cake. I did not give any instructions about the decoration but the end result was so beautiful. Highly recommended.",4,"2018-07-02 14:13:36",10,64,1
