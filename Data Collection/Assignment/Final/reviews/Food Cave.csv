Overall rating would be 8/10.
Will order again soon from this restaurant. Keep up the good taste ‚úåÔ∏è",4,"2019-02-26 03:03:06",10,13,1

Special chicken biryani: This is super good. The chicken was boneless, served along with a boiled egg, and the rice was flavourful and super tasty.

"2430514","Always ordering from this place these days. Taste superb and is very economically priced. Quantity is also good. Quality of food is also worth mentioning. There Chicken tikka, Pudina chicken tikka, tandoori aaloo, tandoori lolipop are scrumptious. chicken tawa masala and chicken masala are tasty. Rotis are soft and nice whenever ordered.",4,"2018-04-24 18:11:16",101,530,4

"43305512","Quantity was good but the taste was very disappointing. The garlic fried rice was dry and bland where as the aloo in aloo paratha was uncooked and the only reason for adding another star was the gobi paratha because it was just meagrely satisfying.",2,"2018-03-25 19:32:43",2,25,0

"132958","It‚Äôs one thing to deliver the wrong item but it takes a whole other level of stubbornness & foolhardiness to argue that it was the right item & the customer has to change their opinion!
Item Ordered: Triangular Paratha
Expectation: Whole wheat paratha shaped in a triangle & roasted on tava until flaky & cooked
Reality: Maida-based round Naan cooked in a tandoor/bhatti with green tutti-frutti sprinkled on top!
Upon calling the restaurant & telling them that they‚Äôve delivered the wrong item & that a paratha is supposed to be tava-made & not have artificial fruity sprinkles on top, their retort was: our parathas are like this only! Deal with it!
Pathetic & lazy excuse mongering at its deplorable best!",1,"2018-02-18 03:53:29",166,459,1
"36495441","Delighted to discover this new place online. Ordered Grilled tandoori chicken and Katti Chicken roll with egg via Swiggy to satisfy late night cravings. 
Was surprised by the tasty food they offer at such affordable price! The chicken roll is absolutely delicious and it wonderfully reminded me of my hometown. The grilled chicken was too good, perhaps the which can compete with the Siddique's. Truly worth the money! ",4.5,"2018-02-11 11:27:30",140,362,3

"516257","Found this place on Swiggy and thought of giving it a TRY. So, had my expectations in place before placing the order. 
Went through the Menu and felt that Schezwan Egg Fried Rice will be a safer bet. 
Order got delivered well before the expected time and its always a huge letdown when restaurants you order food from come up with out-dated packing concepts. 
Pros: 
Quantity 
VFM 
Cons: 
Trail on giving Schezwan rice a different flavor altogether by adding Cinnamon is a BIG NO. I wonder what Chef might have it in his mind. 
I recommend, they stick to the basics. And, in-terms of reach - They had a long way to go!",3,"2017-12-12 01:06:58",64,286,0
