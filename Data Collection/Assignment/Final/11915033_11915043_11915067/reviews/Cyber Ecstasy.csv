"6928631","This outlet is on the fourth floor of Bars and Bowls in gachibowli. The outlet is not much big in size but its ambience is good. The TV is well positioned allowing you to watch any matches if broadcasted. Staff are courteous and well mannered. We took drinks and 1 half tandoori chicken which had good 4 pieces filling for one Person. The only negative would be the location, so if traveling is not an issue then you must visit this place.

I always knew it as Bars n bowls, my bad. Have been there many a times, was dere yesterday also.
Nice ambience, n nice food. Good varieties of kebabs. Loved the Andhra Chicken curry here, fullllll spicy n best part - On curry leaves. I just hate it, n server just took good care of my preference.
In short n crisp, nice place with nice ambience n nice people, good food n of course the drinks.",5,"2015-11-22 01:49:04",57,136,0
