"52049410","Best place for Chinese food and value for money.  We ordered chicken chowmen and chicken wings. Taste and quantity were good.  Vegan might not be as good as non-veg as we tried once...but it’s not a sure shot.",5,"2019-05-18 09:06:36",10,3,0

"40704104","Good chinese food but quantity is very low compare to price but the quantity of veggies was more than the meat , which did not balance. One time visit place",3,"2019-05-14 21:14:57",4,1,0
"60763533","Having heard the name gor quite long time and thought of exploring it.Ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles and chicken lollipop..Must say Noddles look damn intruiging and tasted awesome... Little Pepper added to it could make it more better... But disapointed with lollipop.. Taste was good but lollipop coating was very thick which was taking away the taste of chicken...Still you can go and try other chinese dishes...",3,"2019-05-14 10:30:40",13,10,3

"1944468","Well, I love pad thai noodles. The pad thai served here is tasty.. is it authentic pad thai? Nope. But, does it taste good? Yes it does!! It is more like flat noodles in the American chopsuey sauce. Sweet, sour, spicey; but not pad thai unfortunately.
Located in the sln terminus, the service can be pretty slow thanks to the numerous swiggy/Zomato orders.",3,"2019-04-09 11:43:19",98,906,1
"3076267","went there because it has a ""Thai "" tag. it's a tiny place where they get more online food orders over ""visits"" I guess. we have ordered a couple of noodles and fried rice and taste were good. two people can eat sufficiently with a single order.",5,"2019-03-27 13:53:34",5,13,0

"16083561","Unexpectedly I have been to SLN Terminus being a gold member I choosen Bangkok 169. It was most crowd pulled restaurant out of all restaurants in that food court.
With doubtfulness I ordered Chicken Lollypop and Chilly Babycorn. I waited almost 20min to get my order to hands. As there will be more online orders they can't able to deliver fast to customers.
Once I tasted, both the starters are excellent in taste. Chilly Babycorn is my fav starter in Veg. I ordered the same dish in many restaurants but only few satisfied me. It was one among those ..
It's best place to have tasty food with affordable pricesSai Karthik Vinnakota

"60984746","Go for it if you are fond of Thai. Restaurant takes good care in packaging and related items. Received food in piping hot condition.
I tried this restaurant out by ordering two items Veg Tom Yum Soupand Green Thai Curry (Small)(Comes with complementary rice).
Green Thai Curry was thick and tasty with optimum spices, however the quantity was limited and not as per price. Veg Tom Yum Soupwas extremely spicy took me lunch, dinner and then next day lunch time to finish it off. 
Prices are on the higher end in comparison to quantity of food provided.",3,"2019-02-28 17:01:34",30,6,3

"37220823","Reviewing this place with sole intention of not repeating my mistake of ordering from here. Pad Thai noodles was a real disaster. The quality of noodles was bad, it was crumbled up and not long, how it should be. It tasted really bad-no authenticity, it was like Maggie gone bad. ",1,"2019-02-05 16:49:34",18,5,0
"48301146","Chowmein so good that it made wanna write a review almost instantly! Ordered the Chicken Chowmein which was nothing like you find in most Hyderabad eateries.

"2698588","Ambiance-
Bangkok 169 is located at the food court at SLN Terminus, which has common sitting area with self service.
Food-
Bangkok 169 is famous for all it's Chinese items. We placed an order for chicken Schezwan Fried rice which was delicious and full of chicken pieces. We also placed an order for Chilly Garlic Chicken Noodles which was more than sufficient for a single person. Bangkok 169 offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership. They serve Chinese in disposal container.
Service-
Service was good and staff was very polite.",4,"2019-01-14 02:41:00",101,332,3
"485619","Zomato sucks with its delivery system. First, they promise to deliver the order on time. But later they call and they intimate stating that your order is been delayed. Please accept the order whenever it arrives. Even if the food is cold and not edible for us. And they expect us to have the patience to resolve the issue. That might take up to 72 hours, the Worst part is they request you to store the food until the delivery guy visits our house to check the food. Are they really sure what is being served to the customer?",1,"2019-01-04 17:09:59",8,4,0

"29177847","Tried Thai Red fried rice veg which has coconut as an ingredient to it. The coconut flavour adds a unique taste to the dish. It's a must try atleast for its unique taste. So tried ordering it again where I felt it didn't match the taste of the rice i had earlier. Can definitely maintain the consistency and also provide some sides along with the rice as it is very dry to eat just the rice.",4,"2018-12-27 18:29:06",18,69,1

"2985434","On Sunday , 11th November , decided to order dinner on Zomato.
I had ordered twice from here earlier and feedback has been very good so with same expectation went for the third time.
This time decided to order chicken thai Red curry and chicken thai green rice. No issues with quantity of food, packaging , and taste. Food tastes very good like always.
But the problem with the order was green curry rice, as I noticed some pinches of green colour on rice as well as on some chicken pieces and egg. Looked like they used artificial colouring on food, which I are ill-famed to cause stomach problems , in abundance.
Because of that , I became skeptical of this place and will continue to hold that view for sometime now.
Again no issues with on any other aspect but food colouring, so I will refrain from ordering further unless I get some feedback from the owners regarding my experience specially the on the opinion that food colouring was used or not.",2,"2018-11-11 22:58:59",1,23,0

Never had such distasteful and painful to eat Chinese food. The noodles were somehow bearable and almost as if the cook had accidentally dropped an entire packet of Lal mirch inside.
Paneer 65. The less said the better. Paneer hard as rocks. I'd have to put a dentist on hold if I order Paneer from here. How old was the paneer? Bad experience. Nothing to write home about except that the food was hot.",2,"2018-10-04 12:46:16",36,76,0
