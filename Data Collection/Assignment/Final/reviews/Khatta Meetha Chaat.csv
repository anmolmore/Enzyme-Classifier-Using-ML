"50931643","Ordered Chicken Momos, Masala Pani Puri and Sev Puri through Zomota. It took almost an hour for the restaurant to prepare the order.
The restaurant had stuffed the onions and Chole masala in the Puris before hand and then packed and delivered it instead of packing them separately. This made the puri loose the crispness and became soggy by the time I had them and they tasted bland.
Chicken momos taste was okay and the momo sauce was fine. The only problem was that the outer layer of momos made from maida was too thick due to which it became chewy and some places were undercooked. The chicken stuffing was also very less.
Sev Puri was good and tasted better of the lot. and the restaurant did not provide any spoons with the order. ",3,"2019-04-20 11:30:00",73,64,2
