"16161834","Ordered for rasam chicken rice and they sent me rasam chicken cockroach rice. It was very gross and this is the second time im experiencing this with this restaurant. I would never order again and I would suggest others to watch out for cockroaches and other insects. ",1,"2019-02-27 23:07:14",1,125,1

"38110105","Well seen this on swiggy and tempted for their name The Rice Bar ðŸ˜œ and their prices too.
Well ordered for a veg masala rice for Rs. 100, the quality and taste for just 100 for a medium meal is outstanding. Tried from rice bowl  before but didnt liked their quality as they are low and bit spicy.
Really loved it and enjoyed every spoonful meal, some one looking for a quality and medium meal for just 100 veg and 130 nonveg, definately give a shot.",4.5,"2018-01-02 08:13:36",76,587,0

"402259","We ordered all chicken varieties of rice bowls at an office lunch. The quantities were very less compared to other rice bowls. But the dissapointed aspect was the chicken was served with bone. Neither the taste was great nor the rice flavors upto the mark. Expected a lot from Avakai chicken rice but dissapointed.
