"1184176","I have tried there arabiatta pasta , their burgers and pizza.
The price is a little high and portions are small
But it's worth it.
The crust was super thin and perfect, pizza is all about great sauce and they know it.
The pasta will make you want more but your pocket may say no üòÅ",4,"2018-10-01 08:00:23",87,137,0
