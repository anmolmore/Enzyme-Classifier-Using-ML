"31754018","It's at/near DLF Gachibowli.
Parking area is there.
We had ordered pepper chicken,chicken lollypop and uluvacharu chicken Biriyani.
Biriyani was fantastic.
Then pepper chicken was good. Could add more spices as per it's name.
Chicken lollypop was also ok.
I did not find it fresh. Although taste was average.

"43573341","This place is just opposite DLF gate # 2, Gachibowli, Hyd.
After 2 years visited this place with my colleague for lunch.Observed Initial days, they were serving good quality of food but now they lost quality, customer satisfaction, etc. 
But now, I had a bad experience. 
I have ordered mutton curry and tandoori roti. Mutton curry was simply flat in taste which is full of butter so lost the mutton curry flavour. Then after we ordered chicken biryani which was completely cold and bit salty! I immediately asked to change it but it took long discussion to replace it. 
My recommendation-
If you don't have any other option then only you can visit this place..
Service - 1/5
Ambiance- 2/5
Food - 1/5
Pocket friendly- 3/5",1,"2018-03-10 00:48:12",71,2078,16
"37092742","If you are looking for low budget and good food, this is the best place to visit for the people in Gachibowli. Chicken lollipop and chicken drumstick was good and the biryani was average. If you are a spicy lover, you can try avakai chicken biryani ",4,"2018-02-15 23:58:20",13,12,0
"46995422","Used to be good.. But not now a days..   I had a bad experience recently..  The food I ordered was very salty.  I immediately asked to change it..  But no one cared about that..  No one came in between to even check whether I wanted anything else..  I don't even say it's a poor service..  I should say there is no service at all. If you don't have any other option you can visit this place",1,"2018-01-25 10:59:05",4,5,0

"20369887","This place is opposite DLF, Gachibowli. It's place looks is modelled like a hut in rural areas. It's extremely crowded in the afternoons. I went along with few friends, Avakai and Ulava Charu both varieties of chicken biryani are best when ate together, also try chicken starters. It's a 5 for food, 2 for cleanliness, 3 for service and 2.5 for the seating arrangement. You guys need a bigger place and better structured seating arrangement. Overall, Decent place with very good food. ",3,"2017-01-22 15:44:44",4,7,0
"2716742","This place is near dlf gate 2.
It has a hut like environment and with screen, it is good place to go for lunch during a working day when you just feel like missing a great cricket match out there. 
The seating arrangement is little conjusted. 
Food is not that great. 
They use to have combos but they don't now. 
Want to Try something new near your office, then give this one a try. ",3.5,"2016-12-17 09:15:07",112,372,0

"34471251","OK , the place looks a bit rugged .. had to fight some mosquitoes ,, but it was worth it once we received our chicken manchurian wet, garlic naan and biryani. 
let me tell you guys, it was one of the finest biryanis i have ever eating(please do not compare with shahgouse) with the right mixture of spices.
Chicken manchurian was good comparing to other expensive restaurants.
Garlic naan was the best of all, thin, crispy, full of garlic and most importantly it was hot and lasted long.
thanks for a good food experience.",4,"2016-09-05 11:30:54",18,25,0
"35289024","Got a chance to have lunch here.It's location is very favorable for Tcsers of Synergy Park. It's avkai biryani was new for my taste buds n it felt good with the flavors of mango pickle in it. Chicken dum biryani was good too. Quantity was also very good. Avkai biryani had 5 medium size chicken pieces which is really sufficient. If you want to have some good biryani in budget do visit this place.",4,"2016-09-01 00:41:29",28,49,0
"1553550","FM Cafe-Located next to an Andhra mess in the lane opposite DLF is one of those places that serves some decent food to the office goers willing to try something different without travelling too far from their offices.
I have visited this place on 2 occasions and got to taste 4 varieties of biryani namely ulavacharu chicken,mutton kheema in the first visit and then the chicken ,mutton dum biryani on the 2nd occasion and I can say they have been consistent with their taste and the meat is well cooked and well flavoured,the salan has a good taste unlike other restaurants in the vicinity.
They have some interesting combos and platters along with live match screenings in the evening making it a good option for those staying in the nearby regions and talk of ambience and decor the place is simply done and meets expectations cos ppl hardly have any before they hit the place.Nishith Kumar Dash Girija Nydana ",3.5,"2016-06-28 22:13:07",179,1593,8

"1284908","It's been months since I've been visiting this place and there was never a chance for us to get disappointed. The quality of the food is maintained the same. When we had our first visit to this place we were just thinking who would visit this place and gradually the crowd kept increasing since then and today when we went we almost had to wait for 30 mins. 
For a foodie i would suggest this place and you wouldn't be disappointed. Let it be a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian it's tastes the best.
Earlier they just had the biryani's and now they have a list of recipes to taste.
Good work FM Cafe.",5,"2016-01-08 14:53:37",6,27,0

"14541441","A decent place to visit especially for people who are sports lovers. They set up something good or the other so that the visitors can enjoy the game.
Keeping this in mind, they also take care of the menu. 
My picks: Chicken Burger, Creamy coffee and Chicken 65 or Dry chilli chicken. 
A simple yet stylish place to relax and chill out with like minded friends.",4,"2015-07-16 16:00:20",685,792,0
"29922949","This place is awesome. I just like the ambiance. Also it's a fun place to be with friends especially when there's a cricket or a football match going on as there is a big screen where they project TV channels. Above all, the biriyani is awesome. I have tasted Paradise's biriyani and hate it to the core. I just love the biriyanis in FM cafe, be it Paneer or Chicken. I never had mutton, there but I think it will be good. At FM cafe one has the option of sitting out with the sky above, or in the lounge where they have this big screen(no AC), and they have an inner dining hall where they have AC to comfort visitors.",4,"2015-06-03 19:07:35",1,1,0

And it is definitely ""to die for""! This tiny little place beats a lot of other bigger coffee shops known for their coffee!
If you love coffee and happen to be around it is definitely a must!",4,"2015-04-17 16:20:04",26,68,0

"16136466","We visited this place last weekend for a small dinner get together with some of our friends and it was good experience. My friends had visited this place couple of times and had heard good reviews on Avakaya and Ulavacharu Biryani, so we decided to go and I should say it was a nice decision. 
The ambience is good and normal. The food was served soon and the serving too was polite.
Coming to the food, the food here is not spicy. i think it is well balanced, i eat medium spicy food and i felt the spiciness here is unharming.
We had Pepper chicken and Chicken drumsticks for non veg starters. The Pepper chicken is wonderful with the right amount of spiciness and masala. The chicken is tender, succulent and great.
For main course we had Avakaya,Ulavacharu and Keema Biryani these dishes were excellent. It is definitely different than the usual hyderabadi biryani but worth having. The meat is tender and juicy. The spiciness is not too much and the taste is great. Avakaya and Ulavacharu Biryani are very good and i felt it is better than the meat dish. 
To finish it off, we ordered butter milk and lassi. The butter milk is good but lassi is out standing.  Overall, the bill came to rs.1800 for 6 people which is not that expensive at all considering the location, service and the food they offer.",4.5,"2015-02-13 15:30:06",1,13,0
