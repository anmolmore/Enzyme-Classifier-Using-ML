"29953840","I ordered a Chicken juicy lucy ‘burger’ but it turned out to be a ’slider’. I expect a burger to be an apt meal option and not as a ‘snack’. 
Now, the burger was really very dry( probably due to prolonged delivery). For the price they’re selling at, I’ve had better, bigger and MEANER burgers.",2,"2019-05-08 21:27:08",1,0,0

"1358862","Rare to find good fusion blend burger places in hyderabad.
I wonder how they operate out of a small food truck that’s docked in Nallagandla (opp to Aparna cyber commune) every evening!
The burgers taste amazing  and the quality seems superior!
Chaitanya who actually makes sure the burger reaches in good shape and seems like a person who is very passionate about what he does!
He personally delivered the order when the delivery person got caught up in traffic due to heavy rain...thank you soo much!
Just go ahead...order a burger and enjoy your meal! 👍🏾👏🏻😁",5,"2019-03-17 18:31:18",15,8,0

The cheese in double cheese burger was so pathetic, it was bitter in taste. I never had such a waste of money burger. Really don't want to recommend this place for ordering anything.",2,"2019-03-12 08:08:08",44,867,0

Hygiene is well maintained in this truck. The panner tikka burger was good but I was not much impressed by egg maggi( not a fan of having curry leaves in maggi) .

Happened to go to this with couple of my friends. Staff is young and they took good care of us knowing what we want to eat and suggesting to try their best items. They were so welcoming and pleasant. Coming to food, The burgers are freaking awesome and scrumptious. We tried paneer tikka burger and focassia sandwich. The sandwich is appetizing 🤤and They do serve a mouth watering dessert brownie with chocolate sauce. A dessert after a good juicy burger is heaven. MUST VISIT PLACE GUYS 😋😋!!!!
