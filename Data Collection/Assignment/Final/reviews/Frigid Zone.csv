"1366361","Ordered a ferroro rocher coffee on a whim and was disappointed. Priced at 60 I felt it will be a value for money option but it turned out to be a disaster.
Tasted like chocolate Oreo milkshake with absolutely no trace of coffee or ferrero rocher and was too sweet as well. Well it's my fault too , Shouldn't have expected ferrero rocher at such a low price .
I told the store guy that this doesn't have a trace of coffee and he didn't even care .
Order at your own risk . Peace.
The menu at store and online have a 60% difference as well. I visited the store BTW.
