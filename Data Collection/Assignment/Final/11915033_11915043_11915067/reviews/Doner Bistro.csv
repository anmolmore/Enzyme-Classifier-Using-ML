"30307683","This outlet is there in the food court of Kapil towers just opposite to ICICI Bank.
I tried a Veg Doner.They have two options for bread,one is kulcha and another one is rumali roti,I went for the kulcha bread. The doner had patty, cheese,sauces and vegetables like lettuce, corn etc. It was really delicious and juicy. Patty was also very good.
The kulcha bread was not strong enough to hold all the stuffing,as a result the outer layer kept breaking.I would like to see how it holds up with rumali roti bread.
Worth a try!!!",3,"2018-11-01 01:22:47",179,1874,0

"44725617","Ordered shawarma at midnight. The shawarma was a whole different from the others that I had in the mean time. A friend recommended to have it and the taste was really great. The main characteristics that I really enjoyed was the green vegetables that was added. The lettuce, green onions and coriander leaves was the added taste that really made it special from others that only had the chicken and species taste. I really enjoyed that little unique taste.

"53890930","The shawarma is very cold and the some pieces of the chicken is hard. Guess they might have pre-packed and delivering whenever they receive the order. Not advisable highly.",1,"2018-08-27 21:31:01",2,1,0
"33731944","I ordered special chicken shawarma. Hands down, the best shawarma I've ever had. The flavour of dhaniya in the finely chopped chicken is something to die for.",5,"2018-08-12 01:03:42",12,64,0
