"46369556","Ordered chocolate doughnuts to be delivered to a friend. The doughnuts were amazing in taste, the portion size was huge and the chocolate flavour in the icing was just perfect. It was good value for money at that price. The only drawback was that the packaging could have been better and some of the icing on one doughnut got stuck to the box.
Taste: 4.5/5.
Value for money: 4/5.
Packaging: 2.5/5.",4,"2019-03-30 14:53:44",47,40,2
"802245","Went here for breakfast. Rs 175 for breakfast buffet, in the neighbourhood- it‚Äôs a pretty good deal. Don‚Äôt expect a big royal spread, just the basic - idly, toast Upma, cupcakes and packed juices. Small but comfortable seating space. Good place if you are on your way to office and want to grab a quick breakfast.",4,"2019-03-11 13:52:03",16,115,0
"343717","This was our second visit here. They were serving South Indian along with the usual bread, variant of egg etc. South Indian food was so bad, we couldn't eat any of them after the first bite. It looked like someone who has just started cooking prepared all those. We had to satisfy our hunger with bread banana and some tropicana juice only. First time when we visited, food was quite decent there, so this was not expected at all. Hope they improve!",2,"2018-11-24 12:22:17",36,153,0

Fresh fruits and Tropicana juice .
Muffin's , brown bread which can be toasted to eat with eggs .
And finally coffee which can kick start the day . ",4,"2018-11-23 07:15:07",22,14,0

"27117790","Went for breakfast buffet on one fine Sunday to this Cafe! Almost every Sunday I look forward to look for such breakfast options because let's face it who wants to cook breakfast on chutti! Well, moving on and let's talk about the food on our plates! The details in the bullet points are as follows:
- Variety : Limited (3/5)
- Taste : Good (3.5/5)
- Service : Self (üòÅ)
- Breakfast items : Usual Bread butter toast,Blueberry Muffin, Banana, Boiled egg (not peeled), Bisibelebath (ignore the spelling, smell the food), Idli, Coriander Vada, Sambhar and two Chutney varieties
- Beverages- Tropicana Juices/ Machine Tea and Coffee
My verdict- You can visit this place and my only suggestion to the restuarant would be to include more food items in the buffet entourage!
And yea- The buffet was priced at 150 bucks as we managed to get the nearby coupons! :) Cafe 115 Mukti Osta ",4,"2018-09-29 15:55:29",3,6,0

"7771481","This is a very small coffee shop with an equally smaller menu. Yet, it continues to impress with it's simplicity, extremely customer centric staff, delectable baked items and quick bites. It offers sandwiches, some very basic starters, coffee and refreshing drinks. That's pretty much it. Whenever you feel like spending a lazy evening at a new joint not really worried about what to eat and stuff your stomach, go ahead and explore it.
My only wish is for them to continue what they're doing and introduce new items on the menu as well. ",4,"2018-08-07 03:32:09",31,39,5

The food spread is too good to be true for such a price. It feels like you are having a buffet at a five star hotel for the price of even lesser than an Udipi restaurant.

It's very neat.
It's very calm.
It's very well organised.
The guy who attended me was very very nice.
To my surprise I paid just 85 INR for an americano.

"27007960","I visited this place thrice for the breakfast buffet and I wasn't disappointed.
Everytime they made sure to offer two styles of meals. They had eggs, toast and juice and coffee also with South Indian menu. You can have whatever you wish and how much ever you can consume. And this would just cost 150 bucks. Isn't that a great deal?
The food's hot and the cafe is a tiny little warm place. We staff is one of the most delightful team you'll ever come across.

"1398737","I would advise one to not visit the cafe.
The place has been advertised heavily in adjoining areas and looked like a nice place to grab a quick bite so I visited it with high expectations. But the experience was abysmal. Firstly, they do not serve all items on the menu. Secondly, after settling for pasta, I ordered a pesto pasta with less cheese and oil. I also asked if the sauce is freshly prepared so they could make it with less oil and cheese. After getting reassurances from the waiting lady, I placed an order.
What was presented was far from what I had ordered.¬†
1) The pasta was undercooked.
2) The plate was overflowing with oil despite telling specifically that I wanted less oil.
3) For a cost of Rs. 190, one would expect a bigger serving size.
Only when I asked the lady that I had asked for less oil and that the plate had so much oil floating in it, she told me that the sauce is already prepared earlier. This was completely different from her earlier claim that it is fresh sauce. After some negotiation, she removed the oil from the plate and served it to me.
Later, when I showed her that the pasta was undercooked, she said that she could reheat the pasta for me..... Being a store runner for a cafe, one would expect the lady to know that reheating pasta does not cook it.",1,"2018-03-07 14:34:31",6,20,0

I wanted to have some sandwiches, so I ordered Chicken and jalapeno sandwich with multigrain bread- which is a winner. This simple, crispy, delicious sandwich was what the doctor ordered just for the day. Perfect! But I was a bit disappointed with the lamb shredded sandwich.

I went here on a Sunday morning for a breakfast. One of the few places that have a pocket-friendly breakfast buffet. The spread consisted of Idli, Vada, Sevai, Sambhar, Chutneys, Coffee, Tea, Muffins, Bread, Butter, Jam and eggs. 
While the south Indian food wasn't exactly very authentic tasting (c'mon it is a cafe, what did you expect) the whole ambience and service is paisa vasol! The food tastes good and it is quite filling, The cappuccino was awesome and the staff is very attentive and courteous. 
One of my biggest complaints with Hyderabad food service industry is the lack of etiquette and attentiveness of the staff. Cafe 115 had one of the best cafe staff I have ever encountered.

Things I've tried -¬†
Caf√© Americano - As an aficionado of coffee, I really liked this one. But I was not impressed by the container it came in, looked like very low quality and coffee was spilling from the brim.¬†
Tomato Mozzarella in Focaccia - This was absolutely delish and I'd go to have it again. The bread had a distinct flavor and coupled with tomatoes was just heaven. Must try! I was kinda skeptical about the plastic cutlery but they seem to do the job just fine.¬†
Waffle - Plain waffle served with pancake syrup and whipped cream. The waffle was a little too overdone hence became tough and little difficult to eat. Maybe mine was a one off case but something to be noted. ¬†
----
AMBIANCE - It's got cool colors, bright lamps and nice art on the walls. Definitely a place that works as a mood lifter. Full marks in this aspect.
SERVICE - There was only one lady manning the entire operations, still I had a pretty good experience. Not sure about the situation during peak times.¬†

Pros: good location,  buffet breakfast is pretty filling,  price is ok

Honey chilli chicken in sesame bun : It was served as a burger. The filling was flavorful and not at all meager. Chicken was moist and tender.I was expecting it to be more like a pocket bun with filling rather than a burger. Nevertheless it tasted good.
Tomato Mozzarella in Focaccia : Smell of a good bread has power to hypnotize you.A bite of focaccia with help of  good mozarrela-tomato-pesto gives you the mmhhHHH moment.
Spinach , banana,mango and cinnamon: It tasted like a good banana shake.The mango and cinnamon kick was missing .
Vanilla Nougat : It tasted like a plain vanilla shake .Nougat love was missing.
Shakes were good but nothing exceptional.
Soft center cookie:Oh gosh.Gooey chocolate,soft centered amazing tasting cookie is capable of making you smile on a bad day.I recommend you try this.Best part is you need not share it with your date as they serve 2 pcs per serving :) .
Cheese they use is fresh and creamy.It deserves a special mention.
It was a delight to have word with Pranitha (I hope I got the name right :) ) ¬†she was sweet and quick.crackdownflavors.com",4,"2017-05-13 12:43:08",121,1005,6

"260065","Cafe 115 is a new place serving coffee, shakes and nibbles at the lobby level of Oakwood Residence Kapil at Gachibowli. A nice clean place with a casual d√©cor it can accommodate about 25 covers. I was invited to try out the various offerings of this caf√©.
After a long journey from Begumpet to Gachibowli in this summer, I was quite tired and thirsty. So I tried out some of the smoothies. The menu is short and I was happy to note that none of the items in the Shakes and Smoothies section has a price tag above Rs 100. I was very impressed with their Spinach, Banana, Mango and Cinnamon Smoothie (Rs 100), you can almost feel the diverse tastes independently. The Strawberry and Basil Smoothie (Rs 100) was another one of note.
From the Nibbles section, my favourite was the potato stuffed Mumbai Toastie (Rs 100). The Chicken Kathi Roll (Rs 110) was a miss, maybe I was expecting something close to the Kolkata ones. Honey Chilli Chicken with Sesame Bun (Rs 105) was another from this menu which I loved.
They also have a range of teas and coffees on the menu, all below Rs 75. We were also served a nice looking Waffle drizzled on top with chocolate sauce (Rs 85).
They have a buffet breakfast going in early hours at an attractive price of Rs 150. An affordable price for bachelors who work in offices nearby. Overall, a nice place which I foresee will be buzzing very soon for a quick breakfast or lunch or for an after office adda.

"36083102","Just next to the petrol pump and Capgemini office. A small place which offers exactly what u want from a cozy little cafe. I ordered a smoothie which was really fresh and tasty despite having spinach. The waffles were also amazing. Do try this place.",5,"2017-04-18 12:12:12",8,7,2
"751858","A small yet cosy cafe with a friendly staff, this is tucked inside the Oakwood residency and might be difficult to find at first. There is just one person managing the place so i guess the service might be a little slow when crowded. The ambiance is pretty nice and vibrant while the food is decent and inexpensive.
We ordered paneer Kathi roll, shredded lamb sandwich, chicken burger, tomato mozzarella in focaccia, Mumbai toastie and chocolate waffles. All the vegetarian food was delicious while i think the meat could have been done better in both the non vegetarian dishes. We personally didn't like the Mumbai toastie as it had a lot of beetroot -_- The waffles were really fresh and nice. 
This definitely is a place i would recommend if you want to grab a quick bite.

Can visit again and again for the chicken tikka sandwich and confit chicken sandwich in multi grain bread. 10 for service! Staff is gracious and attentive. Place is small but bright and vibey.
Thank you for the great start to the day and three cheers to the best breakfast cafe I have been to in the recent times.",4.5,"2017-03-30 22:42:51",12,58,1
"39469776","it was a serendipity and worth every bit of it. the break fast  buffet was worth every bit of it for the price, tucked away in a place not easily to be found this gem of a place is a solution for your hunt for an excellent break fast at lesser price than most of the places. went for breakfast and ended up having lunch parcel for my family which costed me less than a price for one person generally I would pay for. every item I had there or got parcelled was excellent.l qualitywise.a feel good factor in terms of quality of food or ambience of the place .
