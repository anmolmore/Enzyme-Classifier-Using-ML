Ordered Multigrain Chapati with Veg Curry& Ragi Onion Dosa. Received in well packed decently hot condition.
Good to have an option of healthy food at such great prices.
Ragi Onion Dosa was well prepared received with Chatney and tasted well.Â  While Veg Curry was filled with over flowing oil thus beating the purpose of being healthy. Chapati with curry was prepared well with wheat and soft.
Would recommend to try this place for healthy foods. However would not suggest Curry.

"1423788","Liked the concept and taste . Jonna pulihora , millet sambar  and beet root halwa ( for those sweet tooth cravings ) are my favourites . Liked the taste , itâ€™s not too spicy  and actually â€˜feelsâ€™ healthy to eat .  Quantity is also sufficient . Pls introduce carrot halwa as well . ðŸ˜€ If  you can come up with millet chicken or mutton biriyani then you have struck the pot of gold ( for meat lovers like me ).",5,"2019-02-21 14:52:02",1,0,0
"40178193","The food quality has depleted terribly. It claims to be healthy food but the reality seems otherwise, you could see the pictures to understand. Too much oil and food burn flakes floating around. itâ€™s pathetic. The reason why people ordering food online is in a trust that you are sending quality food and healthy as you claim to be promising. And if you canâ€™t do that, better donâ€™t say itâ€™s healthy!!!",1,"2019-02-17 12:38:36",18,18,0

"3112496","Ordered Jonna Polihara, Millet Pongal and Millet Sambar.

"47676142","Flavors - The idea of serving healthy food at affordable prices is sensational idea!
The quality and quantity also matters little bit. The taste was fine as one can't expect wonderful taste when opting for healthy eating at very affordable price.
Ordered Millet sambar, Millet pongal and Jonna pulihora. The millet sambar was very tasty and the other two were okay. The portion of food was very less which is very disappointing.
I request management to increase the portion of food. If needed could increase the prices as well as you are serving healthy food. Make your packaging little better. ",3,"2019-01-26 19:59:22",83,146,3
"57643760","Worst food.. I don't understand how they expect us to eat with all that litres of oil!!! And the quantity of food should be seen using a microscope!! ",1,"2018-11-03 22:21:47",1,0,0
"44870962","The quantity given is horribly low. Like it is to be fed for babies. Wrong items delivered ans zomato didn't even care to respond for my grievance. The restaurant took nearly an hour to deliver food that is waste of time. It is too late ar night to order from any other restaurant. And all zomato does, is telling you a sorry. The taste of the items are so bad that they are not even edible when you force yourself to eat. No salt and the ragi malt has salt in it.! NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE...!! CAUTION.!!
