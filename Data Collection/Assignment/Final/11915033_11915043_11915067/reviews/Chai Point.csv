"52442144","This review is based on an order from @Chaipoint
I ordered a combo of Chocolate and Mango shake.
I liked the Mango shake it was having a very good creamy texture and you can feel it and I really liked it, but I didn't like chocolate shake as it has protein powder n I don't like it.
Here's my rating -

"47676142","Chai point - one of the best stop for tea's. I been to couple of outlets previously and found that food isn't that good but the tea were really good.
Happened to order ginger tea without sugar to my grandfather on Zomato. Received well packed mini flask with ginger tea which was too good for me. I have ordered ginger tea without sugar as my grandfather is diabetic but I ended up receiving tea with sugar.
I don't know who's mistake was that but these kind of thing need to be taken care and I hope the management looks into these issues seriously. ",4,"2018-12-14 03:23:49",83,145,1

"57976264","The chai was good. However the sandwich was really bad. It tasted nothing like Bombay Sandiwich and didn't have mint mayo like the description said. tmThw quality of the bread was also horrible and it had an unusual taste.

"350108","I ordered Poha, which normally tastes Masaledar and the Poha we had was sweet because of the Caramelised Onions, which was not a good way to prepare it. The use of oil was extra in poha. I also had ordered Lemon Tea, that was blended with honey, however I had requested to not to put honey in it.
Still I feel the overall experience with Chai Point has never went bad, overall a nice healthy meal that they are able to provide",3,"2018-04-23 19:01:07",96,219,0

Not to forget the milkshakes. Don't know about the other ones but the Mango, Chocolate, Strawberry and Berry Blast are really recommendable. ",4.5,"2017-04-05 13:33:34",59,2736,0
"29826029","# One of outlet located in DLF , i have been there for many time fir my evening snack or moring ones. Tried many items But will write a compact one - all about some good chai and quick snack.
Ginger Chai - made well . Did get the Hit of the ginger . Was Kadak as expected .
Good Baked Vada Pao - can be better . Missing the spicy level in the vada . Puff - a bit oily for my liking There is lot of scope for improvement . These type of places are going to be the INN thing . A Bit of Fine Tuning is what is required Will be back for The Ginger Chai .
Till then Cheers .facebook.com",4,"2017-01-30 01:16:10",157,364,6
"2974916","Have tried their masala tea and ginger tea. Slightly on the stronger side,  perfect to my taste.  Priced a bit steeper than a normal tea stall but worth it.  Also,  a good range of snacks are on offer to complement that cup of tea. ",3.5,"2017-01-05 20:24:20",161,199,1
"16080319","This chai place located at Divyasree Orion is great for anyone who wants to take a quick snack break while at work. Have tried the ginger tea, lemon ginger tea without milk and the chocolate muffin. The lemon ginger tea was a tad bit too sweet. The chocolate muffin was quite yummy.",3.5,"2017-01-04 16:15:52",86,573,5
"27894707","I dont know how I should place Chai Point - Inorbit Mall So i'd rather write it here than It goes waste! How often do you find a place in the mall which served good quick bites that go light on the pocket? Rare, right? But finally there is a ray of sunshine in Inorbit Mall! because they have Chai point here. I got to know about this place via post of some fellow foodie and must thank him! :)
We order chai, chocolate shake - dont remember the name excatly, bun omelette - super impressed (I love bun omelettes & finding the North Indian combinations down the South is quite some challenge ;) But finally I found it & was happy about it), the chilly maggi was cooked to perfection with the exact amount of soup served in the plate. The inclusion of poha in the menu is a good move - however I feel that it was from Haldirams served differently - I'd wish they have their in house poha. Haldirams - not so impressive. Vada pao & puffs were good too :)
Overall, with some 500 odd bucks 5 people were stuffed & happy, so way to go Chai point! you just need a little awareness in the mall!",4,"2017-01-03 11:12:18",276,1753,5
"2890610","Concept is good and rival for coffee points. It is really ideal in setup at shopping malls  in my view it's Always better to have a tea outside at popular joints . Here having chai is a Costly affair and snacks are not really good to eat. as  here  I have visited today in in orbit mall which is opened recently. My suggestion is to go  for having combos ",3,"2016-12-28 21:37:47",317,643,0
"1530980","As the name goes, the place is famous and good only for Tea. Snax is not a good option as the varieties and quantity available are mostly low.¬†
Masala Peanuts (though expensive) is a better combination to the tea. Ginger Lemon and Dum Chai are the good ones i like and prefer to have whenever I'm here.",3.5,"2016-12-26 15:05:39",28,169,0
