The mutton just melts in your mouth and the chicken is just so juicy. Even the Biryani was fantastic. Everything was just perfect. I'll surely recommend this place to others and will definitely visit again and again. ",5,"2018-05-06 18:32:17",1,2,3

They serve you some amazing Pathar ka Gosht which tasted just perfect with aroma of the traditional flavours and the authentic style of cooking the meat. Murg Malai Kebab was juicy and tender.",4,"2018-04-05 23:28:37",1,4,0
