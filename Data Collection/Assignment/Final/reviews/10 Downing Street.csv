"30170567","Place is awesome so their craft beers. Liked Belgian Wit and Belgian Strong Ale. Both are amazing. Food taste and quality is good. They must improve a bit on quantity. After all they are charging good price for food. Lot to improve in service. They are not vigilant about customer needs. No cutlery was kept on the table until repeatedly asked for it. Overall it is a good experience.",4,"2019-05-09 18:56:52",92,727,4
"2273660","I came there with my friend as stags. It was written stags are allowed till 8 pm but the reception person was unkind to say ‚Äúyou are not allowed ‚Äú at 7:45. He was looking down on us just cause there was no girl. The other point that he raised was that my friend was not wearing shoes. It looked reasonable.
Overall, it felt humiliating and I felt it wasn‚Äôt a decent place to even receive you. ",1,"2019-05-05 19:54:55",1,0,0
"42982397","Most terrible place. I used to love Chennai 10D And with that brand I went to Hyd 10D. Firstly they took cover charge for a couple and they had no seats. Could have told us we have no seats we would not have paid cover charge. We stood for good 20 mins and then given bad seats near the speaker where one couldn't even talk! And then the waiters weren't serving us food properly. Had to ask them twice after whicj they took order and when they did they didn't give us cutlery. Can you even imagine??? I had to ask that give forks !!!!!!! I had the worst experience ever of going to a place. Extremely disappointed. Please learn how to manage a crowd. Also I wanted to book my table beforehand. But the option was not even available on Zomato and they won't pick up call. It just felt they didn't want things to be systematic. Extremely disappointed. ",1,"2019-05-05 11:43:02",4,1,0

This is a brewery but again not all beers in the menu are available most of the time. Although the home beer is good. Must try.
Food is okay, can be better.

10D has two outlets one in Gachibowli SLN terminal mall 10th floor and the other one in Begumpet ...The best thing about this place as I mentioned you will have awsm food at very less price...what I ordered was chicken lasagna with garlic bread and Mexican chicken quesadillas both were yummm and they came with a drink of your choice which can be beer wine cocktail soft drink dessert ....

One of my all time favourites is the mushroom added 'Shepherd's pie'!

The food we ordered was chicken lasagna and veg lasagna, pink pasta and spicy chicken rice of which all were good. The food we ordered was served quickly.
In weekdays the place is lightly crowded which makes it a nice place for dates or for Hangouts. ",5,"2019-04-09 11:36:02",50,69,3
"32331267","Vegetarian Review ~
This is my go to place when I randomly decide to go out to grab some brewed beer. I don't remember how many times I have been here. On the 10th floor, the view from the outdoor seating is beautiful, the indoor is nice and lavishly yet elegantly decorated, though I personally like outdoors. The dance floor is a little small but hey the DJ has to be good right!!
With their whole ranged of brewed beers - 4 different samples to try out and one can order a sample of all to taste and decide. I like ale above all. We combined it with honey chilli potato, dahi ke kababs, baby corn tempura.
Honey chilli patao has great spicy and sweet balance but a bit of onion to the fry would have made it a best dish.
Dahi ke kabas were good to taste with the green chutney.
Lasagne is good and pasta is so so and I didn't like it that much. Food is average here but a glass of beer and one won't mind. Wines are not that great too so go for beer üòú
The staff is good and friendly. The price is a bit on expensive side I would say. There are minimal cover charges for the pub. The embience is feel good and enjoy the night away kinda so it's fun.
The DJ is amazing and I always had great time shaking my leg on the floor. So it's a must go if u still haven't been here. üòç",4,"2019-04-06 18:52:17",174,1282,6

The doorman, Mr. Gaikwad, Pinkky has always been there to answer all questions. All the waiters have been cordial and pleasant with me, to mention a few names... Venkat, Pradeep, Pradhan, Mahesh and all the others whose names I do not remember. Special thanks to John Blessie for his warm hugs and welcoming smile makes every visit memorable. Sudhakar you 're great a man of sheer intelligence and ideas.
5 stars for such a great experience + 1 more star for all the happy moments you all have shared with me.
Keep up the good work & keep those smiles on our faces... kudos to the staff. ",5,"2019-03-10 05:09:23",5,2,0
"2997916","Absolutely loved the place! It's has a nice classic touch compared to the 10D in Begumpet which has become too crowded and lost it's charm.
You would change your opinion about 10D if you visit this place in Gachibowli.
Rooftop open air ambience, with comfy seating.
Service is faster compared to many other pubs in the neighborhood even though it's jam packed on a Friday night. They also have a separate section of seating for those who wish to sit and talk serious business, away from the music. The entire hotel which is on the 10th floor has got a royal and classy look.
Staff are courteous and know their menu well. Do ask them for suggestions if you're confused on which ones to choose.
It's got a separate dance floor and Bollywood on the clock after 11 is awesome! They play these retro vibes which all the 90s born adults would love!
Overall it's one of the best I've visited in a long time, will definitely be on my frequent visit list.
Tip : Do try their in-house beers, there are 4 varieties of them. You can get a sample tray of all flavours, so that you can taste each type and choose whichever you like.",4,"2019-03-09 03:54:58",70,775,0

Food is exceptionally amazing. To all the non-veg lovers,chicken lasagna is bae.
The rooftop ambience is amazing- especially in the evenings. The indoor seating is decent :)

"43710085","VEGETARIAN REVIEW: Heard a lot about this place and it did not disappoint me. The only thing that bothered me was the loud music ( I am not talking about the dance floor ), it was so loud that we had to scream to be audible. The dance floor was also decent.

NOTE: I heard that they are charging Rs. 80 per mineral water bottle.

"677679","To spend a nice evening after Office hours, we visited this place and occupied a table in the open area of it.
The weather was nice and thus, we had a good conversation and laughter enjoying it.
In drinks, we had Hot toddy, Brewed beer, Fruit punch, Pinnacolada and many other mocktails. All of these were good but there was nothing special about them.
In food, we had masala omelette, loaded nachos, cottage cheese fingers, mushroom Tikka, fish and chicken wings.
Loaded nachos was the best dish among the list and we had two of them.
Overall, the place is nice but the food and drinks were okayish in comparison to the other places in town. ",3,"2019-03-02 13:10:49",328,1858,0

"16277929","We went here for lunch on a girls day out and were amazed with the classy ambiance and decor.
First thing that made us happy was the interiors and the way the place was done.
We tried veg platter for starters which was delicious. The quantities was just right for two people.
We enjoyed some mocktails alongside and a bowl of corns.
The place is a bit expensive but I think it's worth it as we loved the food and the ambiance.
We certainly would love to revisit it on a date night and enjoy the rooftop experience. At the time we went the rooftop was closed as some renovations were going on.

"959890","Being close to my house SLN Terminus is one place I have often visited be it Serifina ( that got closed) or the Lal Street or mystery rooms or 10D . It's a happening place and worth a visit.
Have been to 10D quiet a few times and the experience has been mixed from a 2 star rating to probably as high as a 4.5 star. I would say a lot depends on the day you are visiting. 
We visited once over a weekend, once during the Christmas time and once when there was a ladies night. The best experience we had was on a weekend and the worse during the ladies night probably due to the crowd that comes.
Ambiance - the place is really nice and has quiet a few sections. My favorite is the outside seating but if u reach late it will probably be full by then. 
Service - if the number of people are less then the service is nothing short of amazing but when it's crowded , and if u are not it in a large group you will probably feel neglected at times. The staff is courteous and quick to attend
Food - Definitely not something to talk about in the place as it is more of a party place where you can drink dance and have an amazing time. food is ok and will not disappoint u. 
Drinks - there is definitely something for the beer lovers here and LIIT is worth giving a try
Overall a good place to hangout and party just probably choose the day you want to go 
Friday night or Sunday night is what I would recommend. And yes the more the merrier... You are definitely going to enjoy if it's a group.

"29082564","My friend and I visited this place on the 13th Of january around 1920 hrs and ordered your strong ALE, we believe that the beer was coughed into and we both fell severly sick with a scratchy throat and dry cough. I dont know why dont your employees wear a mask when on duty because I do not think I will ever return to you guys and this was my second trip to you and the second trip made me fall sick. I will spread it like wild fire for others before they fall sick, I can understand only one person falling sick but both falling sick with the same symptoms after consuming the strong Ale beer then there is something definiately wrong and I am certain that the beer we were served was unhygienic or was contaminated beacsue on my visit on the 8th of Jan I never fell sick with the strong Ale it was on the 13th that my friend and I fell sick . Second, ever heard of loose tobacco cigarettes? Your staff would stand on my head to make sure I am not smoking pot and are you serious?? I use fresh tobacco like American Spirit and roll my cigarettes and never expected this kind of survelance upon rolling a cigarette and taking my loose tobacco original pouch packing to smell that it is not pot, I feel humilated. Train your staff on hygiene and educate them.

"1553550","An amazing place for partying and that much needed respite after a tiring day of work.
10Downing is the brand well known across the breadth and width of the country offers exciting pub lunches and some awesome parties.
This 10D is unique in it's own ways and has a brewery unit attached to it so it is a bonus in terms of the variety on offer for the alcoholics.
Have been to this place on a few occasions once to taste the brews and another visit was for a pub lunch which comes with a glass of draught beer.
My suggestions: Chicken lasagne, Shepard's pie,Roast lamb and a lot more
Must admit the pub lunch here is one of the best and the brews are brilliant to pair with some food.
Overall it is a gem of a place with amazing views,great food choices and a decent collection of drinks to offer you a complete package.",5,"2019-01-05 15:03:35",179,1593,5

"50417898","Ask me about good food, and I'll tell you about 10D. Known for it's best taste and quality food. I've been a regular customer here ever since I moved to Hyderabad and so will I be.
If you've never been here, GO RIGHT AWAY!
MUST HAVE: LASAGNE (10D serves one of the best lasagne ever), Jeera Rice and Mutton Rogan Josh, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Nachos and Spaghetti Bolognese.
Cons: Wine options are bad, that's the only thing I actually regret. But, If you love beer, you'll get lucky. ",5,"2019-01-03 17:02:47",72,856,8

I have been to the same restaurant in other cities and had great expectations. 
The ambience is delightful and the three stars are only attributed to that! It has a rooftop setting and a nice band was performing live!
Coming to food and service, I would rate it 1/5. We tried the jalape√±o cheese poppers, horrible taste- so much so we had to leave some of it. We had the vegetarian pizza- served burnt at the base! On asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one. Only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark. The service was literally horrible, being a Sunday everyone was just chilling on their own I guess ü§£ü§™
I would recommend you to try out other places and save a large pocket pinch by avoiding this place. ",3,"2018-12-29 12:23:20",86,215,3

"36499818","A grand entry, decent ambience and average food. That just about sums it up for 10 Downing Street.
Just as the name suggests, the place has a very British feel to it as far as the ambience goes. It's cost, warm and has great layout. But the layout proves to be a negative as well. We went here for lunch and the place was very loud. The good point was that we got a great seat with excellent view. The service was decent but one of the dishes we ordered did not arrive. I hope they write down what was ordered.
The food itself was good. We had chicken wings, chicken Tikka, seekh kabab, tandoori veg platter and drinks. The food was good and arrived a tad slow. Overall, it is a good place to have a drink and be merry. ",3,"2018-12-26 06:52:14",59,499,6

Heard from a friend that this is apparently rated the best pub in Hyderabad, but living in bangalore for 25 years and Boston for 5, this place is way over priced to start!

Food has got 2 veg plus 4 non veg appetisers.
Main course was very limited. Biryani's and gravy each one for veg and non veg. Tandoori rotis and nans. Desserts were very limited. Vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun.
Alcohol has 4 options. Bacardi white rum, antiquity whisky, Smirnoff vodka and kf beer.
Mocktails, cool drinks,soda and fruit juice available for Mixing. Loud music with Divine drinks on breezy Roof top is definitely worth a try. ",3,"2018-11-17 01:47:50",46,23,5

"1575466","Around 11 of us went to this place to have lunch, located a great place in gachibowli.
The ambience of the place is great and so was the hospitality.
Coming to food, ordered two non veg platters, all the items in the platter were great but when the quantity is compared to the cost,its little disappointing but they entirely make it up with their taste and quality. Beers were good, but they not at all strong, we can drink it like cold water.
The main course was spread across continental, Chinese and indian. From continental side, we ordered pasta, lasagne and a fish. Again the quantity was less but quality was great. From chinese we ordered chicken bamboo rice along with prawns.In indian we ordered, peshawari chicken, nawabi chicken, punjabi chicken. All these main course had complimentary drinks and deserts.
The main thing about this place is it is a place to hangout or go for a date but not a place to for team lunch. Best enjoyed when visited with max 3-4 ppl.

"54207601","I have been to quite a few similar places in Hyderabad and after a lot of hype about this place, finally on the Monday night we visited this place for a team dinner and needless to say that it was a really enthralling experience.
Starting from the reception area *( especially that guy with a moustache... You made the night with your behavior).
After entering the lounge, it kinda of creates a pleasant view with all the interior decorations.
The service was good starting from the starters to the drinks and main course and finally the desserts.
But at the end of the night it was the DJ guy who outperformed everyone. You will be the one who will make me to come to this place again and again. Being from North India, finally got the chance to dance to those Punjabi songs listening to which I have grown. Danced with the heart in my palm. Needless to say that the DJ guy was the icing on the cake with his song selections.
In short, a happening place and if it's your day then these small things will just make your night. ",5,"2018-10-23 20:01:02",5,1,0
