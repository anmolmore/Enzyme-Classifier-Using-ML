"60984746","Ordered Mushroom Masala from this place via Zomato App.Â 
Received the dish in sealed poly-bag in piping hot conditions.
As the packet was opened, lot of oil spilled out. It was heavily oiled vegetable with right kind of flavours including mild sweetness and filled with mashed mushrooms.Â
