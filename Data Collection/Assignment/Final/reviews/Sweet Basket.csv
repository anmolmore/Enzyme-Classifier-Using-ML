"62175390","This review is for nallagandla outlet, can't find it in Zomato. May be they know about their services so they didn't even put it here.. see their Raj kachori.. service folks are totally unprofessional n full of attitude when i asked them raj kachori is so dry this is how he put more curd n ruined it completely.... Stay away from this crappy outlet",1,"2019-04-14 08:35:34",7,6,1

"33295091","You should actually have a no eating on site policy. The cups in which you give the sweets is very small and for sweets like Ras malai you should rename to only malai since there is very little scope for the Ras. Add to that your very impolite staff made it a terrible experience all in all. I hope that you take this feedback seriously and no worries I am never gonna visit again..
Thank you.",1,"2019-01-09 18:52:54",6,2,0

"14171481","Probably the best sweet shop in gacchibowli area, actually it's more than just a sweet shop, they have snack restaurant at first floor.
I have been here too many times but I always end up ordering Raj kachori, pav bhaji, chole bhature , like these dishes are too good!!! Must try types!
For sweet lovers do try Rabdi with jalebi , it's the bestttt!!!
Also one more thing I like about this place is the hygiene level, it's like you can enjoy your Pani Puri without worrying about anything :p
Would definitely recommend this place for snacks as well as sweets.",4,"2018-11-30 16:59:39",32,143,4

The ambience is good. Food is top notch. Was rarely disappointed with any of their items.
Had Chats, Thali, etc. Food tasted great most of the times.
Pricing can be a little more reasonable for the food. Apart from this, everything is good. Cheers 🍻 ",4,"2018-11-03 21:16:57",35,24,0
"1156105","Sweet basket is one of the premium sweet shops in Gachibowli area. They claim that they do not add any colouring agent to their sweets. I think that's true.
Any mithai from sweet basket is very good.
It has a panipuri counter outside the shop, you should definitely try the panipuri it's awesome ..... I have not tried the chocolate jilebi, I just can't digest the thought .... But the normal jilebi's are good.
The shop is on a bit expensive side ... If you don't care for paying the price for getting the quality it's worth it!",4,"2018-10-31 18:51:17",22,62,0

"48456404","Sweet Basket has been around for a couple of years now, however as a customer from the very start I can confirm a serious drop in Quality of Food Products (sweets) served downstairs. Some of the items sampled include: Dhokla (sour with hours of purchase); Cocount Puffs (filling very less); Sev (not fresh when eaten); Muruku (made with wheat floor instead of basin) and Mixed Kara/Namkeen (not fresh); Sakinal (a jaw breaker!).
Prices significantly higher as compared to local shops.... overall a huge disappointment for a purchase of Rs. 1470/-.",1,"2018-07-17 22:09:56",22,16015,0

"43637214","I had to buy sweets as guests were coming and I was looking for sweet shops in the Gachibowli area. I found this outlet and decided to buy a small pack of Paneer Jalebi and Mango Chocolate along with 4 plates of Choley bhature.
The Choley bhature was really nice as the spices were not over the top and the bhaturey stayed soft despite the 20 minute travel time from this outlet to my house. The Mango Chocolate sweet was unique as it had a mix of Mango jelly and Chocolate but not many liked it.
I was dis-appointed with their Panner jalebi as I felt it looked great and would also taste great but it was a bit hard and did not taste that great.epicureantales.com",3,"2018-06-25 09:34:48",443,2461,4

"42077031","Stay away from their Nallagandla branch. I ordered corn samosas, and inspite of confirming, if they are fresh, the samosas were old. The corn stuffing inside them was dry and the onion was burnt. Reason that they would have been fried multiple times. I am facing stomach issue, after eating their samosa. They should be given negative rating, had there been an option on Zomato",1,"2018-05-21 19:53:17",28,24,0
"50547802","Writing about the Madinaguda outlet as couldnt find that one here. Most horrible experience with horrendously rude staff and manager/cashier. I had gone there with my Father in law who had trouble walking. He wanted to have paani puri so i asked if they can prepare it all in one plate so he doesnt have to stand and have. Staff rudely said its not allowed. So i requested for them to make an exception. I got the same rude response. So i asked should i then return the coupons. On that i was told yes. Manager/cashier was worse. Per him if anyone wants to have paani puri it has to be standing else take money back.
Well least i expect from a business is treating customers humanely. Luckily i have numerouse other such outlets around which treat customers like humans and would go to them. Sweet Basket management should realize that their salaries are paid by customers. Continue treating them badly and you will soon have to look for jobs...",1,"2018-05-19 21:06:59",11,4,0

Be it simple rasgulla or chamcham or anyother chhena based sweet, all are tasteful. Motichoor also tastes good but less attractive because they dont use any food colour in it. Chhole bature are ok, aloo dum and matar kachauri is better option. Aloo paratha is also nice. Its a good sweetshop nearby.",4,"2018-03-27 12:05:29",81,170,0

Food (3.5/5):
#Breakfast: 
Kachori : Daal kachori was crisp and moderately spicy. Khaman : Spongy and Soft Jalebi : Freshly prepared in Desi Ghee, warm and crunchy. 
#Lunch: 
Aaloo parantha: Greasy, thick and stuffing isn't great either. 
Thali : Limited quantity Thali is ideal for lunch. It has two kind of curry(panner and mix veg),Dal rice chapati sweet and papad. However I felt dal was less in quantity to have bowl of rice. --> Don't order Dal kachori upstairs, Perhaps they reheat it which makes it greasy.

At the ground floor , they have a sweet shop which serves lot of variety of sweets , dryfruits and namkeens.
On the first floor is the restaurant serving chats and other meals.
Service is quick and prices are also ok for the quality.
We had matar poori , served with aaloo dum , sookhe aaloo, fried chillies and a chutney.
There was no matar in it though
Upon asking they told its present in paste form in the dough.
I could hardly get it's flavour.but if you consider it as a plain poori , it was yummy with the aaloo dum.which was a medium spiced thick red gravy.
We also had dabeli which was loaded and tasted well.
We also had mishti doing served in earthen colourful matka , but the taste was sour than expected.

"36416085","I was a regular visitor to this place whenever I come towards Gachibowli. The food was really good. I always used to feel light after eating here. Today I visited this place after a long gap of 3-4 months. I ordered one mini Thali and one Mango Lassi. The quality of Thali is very bad. The rotis were thick, burnt and not edible at all. The curry has no vegetables at all, it is mostly filled with onions, probably bcoz the vegetables cost is high during summer. Dal Makhani was Spicy. And finally the icing on the cake. The Mango lassi was very very sour. I asked them to change it they put the same thing in another glass, added some sugar to reduce sourness and gave it back which is very sad. I thought this place had some values. One complaining the staff is totally denying the poor quality that they are offering. Anyway I still rate this place 2 just bcoz the owner was little courteous.

Tokri chaat : It was a decent dish . Dahi used is really creamy and fresh. Meethi chutney they serve is finger-licking good. 
Sweet Lassi : It was  sour .
Staff :  Friendly and attentive.
Ambiance : Nothing extravagant , but spacious and clean.crackdownflavors.com",1.5,"2017-04-15 13:07:47",121,1005,0

Sweet basket is a two storeyed sweets and snacks place with sweets and take away on the ground floor and seating on the first floor. This place is our personal favourite for sweets for any occasion. They also have variety of Bengali sweets also available. The badam milk however can be given a miss. 
Snacks : can be improved 
Dabeli: very disappointing! With an imagination of Mumbai like dabeli in my head, I ordered it here. The dabeli was loaded with sweet chutney and the namkeen topping was not at all going well with the dabeli. 
Dahi bhalle : average. The Bhallas didnt have curd seeped into them and hence were relatively dry. 
Golgappa ( suji) : Perfection. Served with both sweet and chatpata water mixture, I relished each one of them ! ",3.5,"2017-04-13 13:04:32",155,1798,3

"2163462","I had a large variety of sweets from this place. I loved the gulab jamun the best.
I would surely recommend everyone to try it out. However, I did find the sweets cloyingly sugary. That would be my only negative comment.",3,"2017-03-11 22:20:58",193,1272,2
"56732","Pardon a Bong when he sits to write a review of a sweet shop. Everything hits the fan.
Still, Sweet Basket has to be one of the best sweet shops in the city. Talk about quality of sweets, consistency of sweets and condiments over time, and their chaat and other breakfast and all-day food items - this place has earnt itself good name and a solid reputation.
They are big on Bengali sweets as well (has a separate counter) and you will be left craving for more.

They have the best puris which are always fresh offering both suji and the aata variants. This place manages to give you the feels of having paani Puri on the street without compromising on the hygine. ",4.5,"2017-01-26 22:37:57",12,43,0
"2227096","The sweet shop has made itself quite a name and they have huge variety of sweets. The restaurant above is a decent place to have Chhole bhature, chaats, gol gappe, poori sabji etc. The place is clean and the staff is courteous. Items tastes good and goes well with my North Indian taste buds. Pricing is also competitive and food items are worth the money spent. Overall a decent place. ",3.5,"2017-01-22 16:28:58",118,2041,3

"86715","The sweets are fantastic. The snacks are good if I were to say in short.
Now coming to details -
They maintain good quality and are serious about it. The place is squeaky clean and the staff is courteous and prompt. I love their Bengali sweets esp. Malai toast and chum chum. Also the aloo samosa and savouries like mixture and murukku must be tried.
Haven't tried their other sweets but I can say they should be good as they don't compromise on quality.
The restaurant above is ok.  as compared to what they serve on the ground floor.
They should have valet parking as the rush is just too much and one is in two minds if he should take the trouble of parking in one if those lanes and walk or.just drive ahead.... I think they lose customers due to this. Valets are a necessity. Hope someone takes this point seriously.
But I di park in the lane and walk ti have my fill of chum chum :)",4,"2017-01-18 19:33:33",110,1535,0
"391921","Sweet Basket is much more than a sweet shop. Love North Indian food? This is one place you must try. One of the only place in Gachibowli where you can find authentic North Indian taste. Chole Bhature, Pav Bhaji and Poori Subzi are delicious. Plus, it's the only place in Gachibowli which serves Sooji Gol Gappas as well. You have to move a bit to grab your dishes since this is a self service restaurant, but the preparation time is too good :)",4,"2017-01-15 14:20:26",29,425,1

They have a balance is traditional sweets, and the ones with a twist... Like chocolate badam laddu or chocolate kaju rolls.
The sweets are always fresh, hygienic, and tasty. The prices might seem high, but I consider them VFM.
Tried their dhokla too, and it was really yum!
See them opening an outlet near Miyapur. Then I WI visit them more for sure!
Keep up the quality management folks!",5,"2016-12-09 17:34:47",29,31,0

You have to climb up to the first floor if you wish to sit and eat .We ordered choole bhatoore, Chocolate Jalebi and Kulfi. It was one of the worst choolhe bhature that I ve had on my life. Choolle were completely crushed and there was simply no uniform taste of it in the dish. Khulti was so-so,below average. The only good part was where they attempted genuine innovation>Chocolate Jalebi . It was truly yummy and the only thing which I enjoyed.",2.5,"2016-10-10 00:53:46",41,203,4
"32567851","Tried this place today to catch a quick lunch. Not a grand place, but okay to catch a quick bite of chaat items or quick meal. They have a self service with limited options for meal. I tried their mini thali where they had rice, dal, raitha, butter naan, pickle and one veg curry. It was sufficient for one person. Though I didn't like the dal, but veg curry and raitha were good. They definitely can improve the quality. We also tried their pav bhaaji which was good. But quantity was too less for a person. We also tried their Badam milk which was good. My daughter loved it. Best thing was that food was not very spicy.",3,"2016-10-09 21:02:36",34,1078,0

"32904059","I had heard from friends that you get chaat at sweet basket but had never tried it till now. Cravings for pani Puri led us to sweet basket for Sunday lunch. We were pleasantly surprised with the menu. They had suji ke batashe too! Pani Puri, vada pav, pav Bhaji are some of our favorites. They have a lunch/dinner menu too. 
We ordered vada pav, suji ke batashe ki pani Puri and aate ke batashe wali pani Puri. We also ordered one lunch thali - they have an option to take phulkas instead of roti.
The vada pav was delectable. The best I have had here. I gorged on pani Puri to my heart's content. The pani Puri is served to meet various taste palates. 
The lunch thali was limited but tasty. There was mix veg, dal makhni, 3 phulkas, rice, Raita and pickle. It was like having a light home cooked meal.
The best part is that this place is pocket friendly! ",4,"2016-09-05 12:00:06",92,894,4

"573349","Sweet Basket is another sweetshop cum restaurant in the Telecom Nagar area of Gachibowli located just a few metres away from the Traffic Commisioner Office along the same side of the road. The ground floor of the shop is where they have the sweets and on the first floor they have their restaurant. Along with the innumerable variety of sweets they also have light snack items like Samosa, Kachori, etc on the ground floor. Seating is available only on the first floor and is enough for 50-60 people together. 
Just for trying a few things out I ordered a Pav Bhaji and a Samosa in the restaurant. Pav Bhaji was served quite well with a huge dollop of butter in the bhaji and well buttered and toasted pavs. On the side was a slice of lemon and diced onions as the salad. On the first bite however I found the bhaji wasn't too appealing for my taste as it was a little too bland. The Samosa on the other hand was great with a crispy outside and a spicy potato filling. Samosa was served with a sweet Red Chutney which made the experience even more pleasurable. 
Nothing to talk about the service as the restaurant was essentially a self service where you pay for your order to get a receipt or a token which then is to be given when your order is prepared. The food however got out of the kitchen in just a few minutes which was nice to see.instagram.com",3.5,"2016-07-23 22:39:14",241,3414,3

Sweets are good in taste. (except the chocolate jalebi :P) The place is clean and hygienic.

The food was fine but we were terribly disappointed to realise that we had only one man instead of the ordered and paid for 2 naans.
