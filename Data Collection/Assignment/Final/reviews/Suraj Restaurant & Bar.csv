"37532726","It's an okay kind of bar. The open terrace option is good but the overall bar is a quite shabby and one can't really think of sitting there unless he/she has had some drinks or has a great company. One visit was enough to understand that another visit is not something the place deserves. The staff is cool, not bad. Food was quite tasty, hence the 2 stars!",2,"2019-01-27 19:13:09",7,63,0

"39999810","Food is nice , but the waiters on the roof are irresponsible. They bring your food or drinks to the counter but don't get it to your table untill you ask for it .
And the prices have been slightly increased from what we see in zomato ",2.5,"2017-04-26 20:18:17",7,3,0
"36566889","Nice place with good food and not so expensive alcohol. Ambience is not that great but good friend is their roof top place. Staff if friendly and main experience is their good food. Starters like crispy chicken, tangdi kebab, loose prawns and good biryani must try. Good options for Vegetarians as well. Especially credit to one of their senior waiters Ganapati for his dedicated service.",5,"2017-01-24 19:23:32",2,3,0
"36962554","True to what others mentioned on top .... The reviews are not to demean some S
Restaurant but an opportunity to be better ... I wonder if these guys even know they have been rated over here..
Half cooked meat... Over spicy quantity of biryani...",1.5,"2016-12-17 16:26:49",4,11,0
"35088465","A typical boys den, good be here with a boys gang, but don't expect hygiene or quality food. 
Enjoy the rooftop sitting and the view of the adjoining buildings. ",3.5,"2016-09-09 12:57:23",65,61,0
"33016156","It was very bad experience. I visit there once in a week but my last experience it was very bad. food was very nice but service was poor. the guys who work last 7 years he don't know how to talk to the customer.",1,"2016-08-17 10:54:51",3,22,0
"34836765","This was my 2nd visit to the place, well this place is surely not going to make you Gung ho about it. But a place where you can unwind yourself after a tiresome day at work. This place will not let you down when you need that me time. I went with couple of my friends ordered few drinks n chicken tikka. They were good. Then we ordered Suraj special Biriyani. It was flavourful and the chicken were really soft n juicy. I really enjoyed the Biriyani out there. Please remember this one is coming from a hardcore Kolkata biriyani lover. I would surely recommended others to visit this place but yes only with friends. The price were also reasonable, unfortunately I didn't take any pics to share with you guys and the staffs were nice and friendly. üëç From my side.

"1967712","See, this is the type of bar, where you go with your male friends. Its a good bar for them. Because boyz usually go for affordable drinks and OK ambience. The drinks are quite affordable. They have moderate service though the manager is quite cheerful. Don't think you can for a party, but having a good guy conversation, and I am sure in that respect, you would have a good time.",3.5,"2016-06-26 13:20:23",4,61,0
"1468799","Had a really bad experience, went there for our weekly gang outing and from the start it was a bad experience, the lift wasn't working and we had to climb 3 floors and the place was bad and the staff were rude and they were like just for money , food and liquor  was overpriced and tasted decent... We were forced to tip as the waiter demanded one after I had swiped my card . ! A place to think a hundred times before you visit üòë",2.5,"2016-04-01 22:25:51",70,430,0

One of those places where you go just for drinks and having fun. ",2.5,"2016-03-23 22:29:48",86,700,0
"33054520","Its like the regular bar and restaurant where one can go without planning with a bunch of college friends, hop in, have some drinks, eat average snacks and food and leave the place pocket friendly.....",3,"2016-02-11 20:00:12",19,8,0
"1441873","A good place for friends to have beer and chat loudly and the ambience compliments it... Service is good.. Food is up to the mark.. Price range moderate.. Only go there if you want to talk to your friends and not watch a match or listen to loud music..
Ambience : 7/10 Clean & Simple
Food : 7/10 No one pays attention to the food here. But it's good.
Price : 8/10 Good based on the service and quality. ",4,"2015-11-22 21:33:21",7,175,0
"888824","This place is a bit underrated but I must say this place is awesome. This place has a bar and you could get a beer for as low as 85 bucks. You could enjoy your meal on the rooftop and it services awesome food.",3.5,"2015-10-24 18:25:57",45,175,0
"203873","Great rooftop place to enjoy great drinks and your favourite snacks with friends. Please note this is not your regular restaurant with comfy ambience and interiors. Rather its a nice laid back rooftop with some chairs and table thrown in for people to relax and talk whatever sh*t they want to. The drinks are reasonably priced and served very quickly, starters are also very delicious and reasonable for the price they charge. Special mention to Tangdi Kebab and beer combo at this place. Go anyday post 7pm to have a great time.",4,"2015-07-22 22:49:49",40,473,0
"14541441","This place is underrated bit serves great chicken side dishes with cheap drinks.
The chicken kali mirch, dry chili chicken, few beers are great choices.
I got old monk rum here only for a single day and hence, I request the management to serve the same.",3.5,"2015-07-14 15:29:10",685,792,0
"2360690","This place is excellent for some bloody cheap drinks with friends.  The environment and ambience will not appeal to females much, but that's my opinion. Even food is very nice, I have even visited this place just for food. I love rotis they serve here.",4,"2015-06-22 01:11:06",17,105,0
"851738","Good ambience.. A bit slow service. Average food quality. But an awesome place to sit down and have some beers. Visited this place every weekends with my buddies till the time I was in hyderabad.. 
Out of all the bars I visited in hyderabad this one is on top. Decent rates or hard liquor almost same as Mumbai bars.
Easy on the pocket. Overall a kickass place to chill.
P.S this review is only applicable for the 3rd floor bar :P",4,"2014-12-01 23:16:22",16,217,0
"786673","Located on the road connecting Gachibowli and Kothaguda, this underrated restaurant is a welcome relief when you are returning ¬†dead tired from the IT Hub and want a short break to invigorate your 'spirits'.
On a Friday eve after the tiring work , a group of my friends decided to have dinner and drinks before heading home and Suraj Restaurants was unanimously the preferred choice.
Underwhelming decor, low-lit surroundings compose the ambiance of this place.Weekends can turn out to be crowded, so it is recommended to reach this place early and place the orders.
We ordered for Kasturi Murgh Kababs and Chatpata Paneer Tikka ¬†with beverages as starters.The Kababs were served within 15-20 minutes and tasted really awesome.Each plate had about eight or nine kababs with salad and a thick pudina chutney. For the main course, we went for the special chicken biriyani and found it to be lavish.The chicken pieces were boneless and there was generous pieces of those tender flesh mixed in the aromatic rice.I specially recommend this biryani if you are dining in here.The waiters were quite courteous and promptly responded to serve us.
It was a filling experience and easy on the pocket too.",3.5,"2014-10-25 00:37:09",117,829,0
"2037016","I share a long history with this place, the spl chicken biryani is my favorite. Beer is cheaper than most other places. Starters are not bad, overall a nice hangout place. The ambiance and maintenance definitely needs a facelift. The rooftop especially badly need renovation!",3.5,"2014-09-18 09:47:21",78,310,0
"3154545","have been visiting this place often for last 3 years with friends.. It's easy on pocket and they have some really good things that one must try there. I took 3 people from my office for a treat there and they were impressed with some of the things on menu.
I recommend crispy corn, pahari kababs and bonesless chicken biryani at this place.
The only complaint i have is that for friday evenings, this place is understaffed. there are like 2 waiters trying to manage the rooftop  and it gets painfully slow to order and get your order on your table.",3,"2014-07-20 00:47:29",5,1,0
"1734175","Just two words 'NO PEANUTS'!!
Don't get fooled by their so called menu..the cheapest item available is French Fries!!!
Just wanna say..you can go to any other place rather than coming to this restaurant.",1,"2014-03-12 21:15:59",1,0,0

"1353752","Decent rooftop view at night if you can tolerate sitting on iron chairs.. though you can request cushions to sit on. It's a moderately priced place, and should be just the place if you want a no- frills experience to have a few drinks and light snacks with friends.",3.5,"2013-11-08 17:24:06",3,0,0
