"60984746","Need a quick Snack to refill your pouch... Then Subway is the way !
I ordered Mexican Patty Sub [12 inches]via Zomato App. with
Add On : Salt and Pepper
Sauces : Red Chilli Sauce, Mustard Sauce, Mint Mayonnaise Sauce, Harissa Sauce, South West Sauce
Veggies : Lettuce, Cucumber, Olives, Pickles, Jalapenos, Tomatoes
Customize : Toasted Bread with Cheese
Bread : Multigrain Bread
Received it in well packed, soggy condition and with observation of less quantity of sauces. While it tasted to the best like of well made sub i.e. like your home made sandwich in shape of sub with all veggies and sauces.¬†
They have lot of options in bread and fillings. Bread can be toasted with added cheese else served cold. Bread size served is 6 inches or 12 inches (Foot Long) long. I ordered 12 inch long which they cut in half and send you two 6 inch subs.
They normally have sub of the day which is generally of lower price than regular Sub of your choice. However if its veggie delite then would recommend to go for your choice incase you are not too health conscious.
My personal Fav is Veg Shammi or Mexican Patty (with Multigrain bread and kinds of spicy sauces) while you can try out the one of your choice in veg or non-veg.¬†¬†
While due to foods cold nature some may not like it however its still my fav option to go for and anyways you can atleast get the bread toasted.
Ambience and taste of Subway is same all around in different outlets while would recommend to have it at restaurant than order for delivery as it gets soggy due to sauces and at times you dont get all sauces/ingredients with quantity/taste you need.

Then reach subway. They have many bread options.
My personal SUB suggestions are
*Paneer Tikka Sub*
* Corn and peas Sub*
*Chicken Tikka*
They have sub of the day which is of lesser price than the normal Sub‚Äôs
They have 6 and 12 inches long sub‚Äôs
Choose your bread from the available options
1. Multi grain Bread
2.Honey oats bread
Choose main ingredient‚Äî paneer,chicken and what not..!
Gather some sides like ‚Äî cucumber,lettuce,tomatoes,olives,jalape√±os,beans,onions and other things
Sauces‚Äî They have sweet and spicy sauces
Select sauces accordingly 
1. Tandoori Mayo (NEW SAUCE ALERT) üö® 
2. Harissa ‚Äî this is my fabourite
3. Mayo
Now your SUB is all- ready
Grab a drink and then you will be set
Coming to the ambience it‚Äôs the same everywhere.

"50453673","Short review: Don't order as they don't deliver the quality food. Just go to the restaurant if you want.
Long review:
This branch used to be decent, but they've plummeted from decent to plain bad. The service that you get at the restaurant is fine because you're there to supervise it. But the last 4/5 orders that I've ordered have been screwups. The bread is never toasted, so it's not crisp and the cheese is not melted. I ask for no capsicums and yet its always there. They put all the sauces in the same spot so there's no flavour in 80% of the sub and an abundance of sauce in 20%. Whoever is making these subs is extremely lazy.
The restaurant doesn't pick up their calls either to verbally give them instructions.
I've contacted Zomato support about this the past few times and they've been helpful. But you won't be satisfied with your food and this branch fails to deliver quality food.
I really hope they improve, Subway is a great snack to battle that occasional hunger. But if you're thinking of ordering, forget this particular branch. ",1,"2018-11-14 15:40:37",2,2,0
