"80571944","I order a Paneer Tikka Mac n Cheese, and essentially got a bunch of corn and jalepenos dipped in white sauce - without a single piece of mac or paneer. I ordered something to eat, not a soup. It is one thing to send bad food, and entirely another to send inedible food. Absolutely not acceptable.",1,"2019-05-10 20:12:12",1,1,0
"1284857","So , this is a review program and I had ordered corn and pimento Lasagne and Bombay masala quesadillas.
The lasagne was packed in an amazing manner and it was hot for a pretty long time after it got delivered to my place.
The taste was also good and its definitely a must try.
The quesadillas was also perfect in taste and I loved the way it was packed and delivered to me.
Overall I really enjoyed having both of them and is definitely a must try. Cheers ",4,"2019-05-02 15:18:11",106,1035,0

"16142730","Tried the Peri Peri paneer steak and the corn lasagne.
Paneer steak - The paneer was roasted very well and was tasty. I could eat it separately too. It came along with some exotic vegetables and some chutney and rice. The rice were a little dry, but they chutney added a tangy taste. It was overall good but a little dry.
The corn lasagne was perfect!!! The taste of the vegetables and perfect amount of cheese on the top. Loved it! It felt like it was baked for the right duration. Though from appearance i could only see cheese, but beneath their layer was a well cooked lasagne ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Looking forward to try the other things on the menu!! ",4,"2019-04-27 08:15:12",166,977,2

I didn't find any paneer tikka or anything of paneer sort in the pasta. The complementary bread sticks tasted and smelled very bad and it was so oily.

"15102371","Have received a pack of 2 dishes, i.e. Masala chicken Quesadilla and Tuscany meatballs lasagne for tasting purpose from this outlet.
Masala chicken Quesadilla was one of the best Quesadilla I had in recent times, full of big chicken chunks and veggies. It was having right proportion of sauces and cheese. Really amazing in taste.
Tuscany meatballs lasagne was decent one, it was more of dominated by tomatoes. Which would have been more filled with cheese and meatballs but it wasn't the case here. But tastewise it was decent. If the amount of tomatoes would have been decreased it would have been great.",4,"2019-02-09 09:20:16",362,4095,1

I was sent food from Firangi Bake for the review program and I thouroughly enjoyed it. The Corn and Pimento lasagna was really good and very tasty. It was very creamy and was delivered hot. Tandoori kukkad pot rice tasted wella dn teh chicken was very well cooked. Although there was a layer of cheese on top of the rice which I'm, not a big fan of. For a second I got confused between the lasagna and the rice. The quantity was per serving pretty less for one person. A special note on tehir packaging which was really good and the food was delivered pipping hot.

"33536593","~ by INVITE ~
As part of the review program by Faasos group, I had the opportunity of ordering from all 5 of their outlets serving up different cuisines and courses. My favorite of the group was Firangi Bake. Named aptly, what comes out of this kitchen is truly Firangi:
üåÆ MASALA CHICKEN QUESADILLA (230) -
The best item of all the food I tasted. The bread was fried instead of being baked and it wasn't something I'd expected. Delicious and tangy minced chicken keema was stuffed inside. Apart from it being oily, it was perfect. A good Indian take on the classic Quesadilla. üëåüèªüòã
üçù MINCED CHICKEN LASAGNA (300) -
One word that comes to mind when thinking of Lasagna is greasy, and this was just the same. Thick and stringy cheese topped on layers of minced chicken, lasagna noodles and authentic tasting tomato sauce. Baked and cooked well, again just too oily/ greasy.
I would recommend Firangi Bake out of the 5 outlets of Faasos group, although the food is slightly pricey, items are unique and rare. Once in a while definitely won't hurt. üòâ

The lasagna, i didn't not feel the taste of paste much because it had thin sheets of it. Minced chicken was good. They were a fusion of Italian and desi cuisines. The rice and chicken were well mixed but the rice seemed to be little dry. The cheese stuck to the walls of the aluminium and that's the reason I'm not giving a 5.

"48499440","Order a minced chicken lasagna and a veg pot rice. The lasagna was topped with a thick blanket of cheese. The pasta sheets were very thin and didn't do much in terms of texture. The chicken mince though, was sufficient. The sauce was flavorful and saved the dish. The veg rice was terrible and did not have any flavor. This too had a thick cheese layer. The rice underneath did not impress us much. It had an overpowering taste of a few spices and the vegetables too, couldn't elevate the dish.
Both these dishes came with a good amount of bread which was awful. It smelled burnt and tasted terrible. We ended up throwing the bread altogether.
At the given price point, the veg rice is nowhere up to the standards whereas the lasagna with slight improvement is good enough.

Ordered chicken lasagne and chicken pot rice.
Both turned out good. Chicken lasagne was full of cheese layers...with loads of chicken sausages, olives, sweet corns, and jalapenos sandwiched between the layers.
Chicken pot rice is what I liked more. Chicken Tikka pieces and it's gravy was properly mixed with long grain rice. Not so spicy yet tasted good.

"2443258","Firangi bake as a part of fasoos, has Indian mix Italian based dishes. We ordered a veg lasagna and a Bombay quesadilla. As always the first thing is packaging and they have it the best.
Coming to the taste, the lasagna was one of the best ones we've ever had. Cheesey, tangy and filled with veggies which is how we love. Everything about it tasted so good that we craved for more.
The veg quesadilla on the other hand dissapointed us. Which is why I am not giving this a 5. The filling in the quesadilla was very less. It was more like we were eating just the outer part of it and the filling was just, not there. We could not finish it.
Overall, it is the lasagna that stood out for us and for only which we are giving this rating. It is a definite must try.",4,"2018-07-13 16:33:33",88,1763,2
"34884988","Definitely, they put an effort to put a Desi tadka with Italian cuisine. But it doesn't look working as expected.
Ordered pot rice and lasagna and it was delivered after a long time of preparation. Packing is just very awful. Since, it took some time to deliver, the cheese of lasagna and pot rice stuck to the alluminum foil. Pot rice was still eatable since it has some life in it, but lasagna was worst. It became just like rubber and no taste in it. They also served pita bread with it, which was average in taste.

"35725514","Italian food has always been my favourite and recently I have developed a penchant for mexican food too.
Firangi Bake took great care of my love for both the cuisines and sent me a box full of love which had Quesadilla and Lasagna.
As part of the food review program, they sent me a Bombay Masala Quesadilla and Corn and Pimento Lasagna.
The Quesadilla was a real delight with 'Bombay Masala' type fillings as in a perfect Indian taste blended with some Mexican.
The Lasagna was not as amazing as the Quesadilla as I could just find some corns, tomotoes and bell peppers with a layer of cheese on top. It was just like a dictionary definition of Lasagna. It could have been far better and should have been baked properly.
All in all, I would definitely recommend the Quesadilla.

Coming to the taste:
Roasted veggies pot rice: Flavourful Biryani rice with lots of veggies topped with a dense layer of cheese. Never tried having rice with cheese, but the combination was actually good!
Veg lasagna: Obviously had a desi tangerine and spicy taste ('global bakes with a desi twist' as they say). Didn't really enjoy this dish much.

The quantity was extremely filling and good to go for a meal for one person. The Roasted Veggie Pot rice was equally satisfying to my taste buds.

Quesadilla was nice stuffed and tasted very nice.
This is a must try dish from Firangi Bake and seems as if their signature dish.

"573349","Firangi Bake is another one of Faasos' ventures with the sole aim to amalgamate classic western dishes with an indian twist. Similar to its other subsidiaries Firangi Bake too is delivery-only place, offering some of the most delectable treats you would ever try. WIth outlets spread far and wide in the city, this joint is getting popular by the day and deserves every shred of it. They recently sent me two of their dishes for reviewing, Masala Chicken Quesadilla and Tandoori Kukkad Pot Rice. 
Going for the Quesadilla first, at first look the dish looked just like any other quesadilla with a slight difference in terms of the filling which had spiced chicken chunks along with some bell peppers and onions. Taking a bite however changed things dramatically as the flavour of that filling took it to the next level. Hot and freshly grilled chicken with a kick of heat, loaded with crisp veggies topped with a generous amount of melting cheese, all wrapped up in a crisp and flaky paratha. Perfect Indian-ization of a mexican delight. 
Tandoori Kukkad Pot Rice was something that surprise me a little on account of the presentation. The rice was covered with a huge layer of cheese, baked in the oven to create a lasagne like crust on the outside. The inside however had some really flavourful rice with big boneless tandoori chicken chunks which in totality was a bliss to the taste buds as well as to the stomach. Alongside served was a portion of herbed bread which was a good accopaniment to the overall dish.
The dishes came out packed neatly in good quality boxes with some fine disposable cutlery. The prices did justice to the portion sizes which are given which does make this provides a good value for money.

Food-
I placed an order for Tuscany meatball lasagne and Chicken Kheema Quesadilla from Firangi Bake, Gachibowli. If you are a fan of 'FRIENDS' tv series, then you must have heard about ""Lasagne"", which Monica used to prepare on Thanksgiving. A very few restaurants in India serve lasagna. Firangi Bake serve lasagne packed in Aluminum foil vessel inside their signature boxes of Firangi Bake along with pieces of garlic bread. Lasagna is the perfect combination of meatballs, chicken, capsicum and corns with the authentic taste of spices from Firangi Bake. Tuscany meatball lasagne cost me approximately INR 280 only.
Chicken Kheema Quesadilla is the perfect dish to order with lasagna. My all time favorite Quesadilla a combination of Chicken Kheema, onions, capsicum, with superb taste of spices. A single dish of Quesadilla contains two pieces of wrapped in separate papers inside a single Firangi Bake box. Chicken Kheema Quesadilla cost me approximately INR 230 only.
Service-
Firangi Bake had their own delivery team, serves customers within estimated delivery time. Food is well packed with Firangi Bake signature boxes with name and tagline printed on them.

--------------
1. Corn & Pimento Lasagne :
Delicious cheese-fueled lasagna with corn, capsicum, tomato, pickles baked into it.¬†
Usually, it‚Äôs hard to find good quality foreign cuisine here but this serves as a benchmark.
2. Veg Mughlai Mac N Cheese :
Another dish for cheese lovers. Mac n cheese had the same lasagna top with different ingredients inside (Mac n cheese).¬†
Nothing special here; just the general Mac and cheese style. However, the preparation was delightful to taste.
Both the dishes above, were accompanied by soft bread on the side. Similar to a ‚Äúkulcha‚Äù bread but softer.
3. Raspberry Cheesecake Shot :
Dessert shot was similar to the one you get at CCD.¬†
It was, however, a different flavour with a raspberry jelly/jam on top of the cheesecake pastry with a little layer of brownie at the end.¬†
Tastes good; like a shot of ice cream cake.

I was hoping a little too much from Firangi Bake after reading all those reviews but i was totally disappointed.
This was the very first time i had a lasagne and I just dont feel like having it again.
Taste- toooooo much pizza sauce, the cheese was sooo dry. Had a hard time finishing it.
Thank God the portion is very less, won't even fill one person's hunger.
Cost- felt like everything is over priced for the quantity and quality. Wouldn't spend 240 plus delivery charge for this thing.
Delivery- delivery was quick
Packaging- basic, aluminium dabba in a box.
The slider filling were leaking.",3,"2018-05-11 16:03:37",31,21,1

to begin with, the package. they separately pack each dish in a nice paper box with utensils, so it's perfect to order at office or for a movie night dinner.
Then the presentation, even with delivery they manage to make their food look so beautiful.
And the food itself, simply amazing. I ordered the bean quesadilla and the veg rice pot. I really really enjoyed my meal. the quantity was perfect as well.

Firangi bake serves varieties of quesadilla, lasagne , potrice. Was sent the Bombay masala quesadilla and chicken minced lasagne for the review.
Bombay masala quesadilla was very good in terms of packing and holding the stuffing together. It was great in taste and was worth the price, quantity was excellent and can fill your stomach easily . They had good stuffing in it but had way too much masala on the ends but that gave a great flavour to the quesadilla.
Minced chicken lasagne was the star of the show, one of the best lasagne i had , excellent in terms of packing , taste was heavenly with thick layer of cheese on the top which just gives a lush of flavour in your mouth , below the cheese was the minced chicken which was excellent in taste, minced chicken tasted similar to the Bombay masala quesadilla but had a diff taste due to the cheese and minced chicken pieces like kheema , it just fills your stomach completely and keeps you happy with taste, so what else fulfills the need of good meal.
The base below the minced chicken was like a roti and has a good taste , the roti they serve alongside with the lasagne was okayish it was a bit cold and had oil dripping on the either sides of the rotis.
It was a good experience with firangi bake , will be trying their other offerings soon. ",4,"2018-04-01 01:10:39",41,215,5

Much heard about place in my Zomato feed is Firangi bake.  As different as it sounds it's menu is different . I had ordered Chicken Keema Quesadilla and Minced chicken lasagne. 
The Quesadilla was little different from other places. Had a more of Indian flavours . Tastes really good . The best part of it is that the stuffing overflows . Coming to the Lasagne , it was cheesy , layered with chicken and juicy . Something that would fulfill your lasagne cravings. Definitely hitting the place to try more in the menu",5,"2018-03-24 14:57:44",67,893,2
"889325","I have heard about this delivery place and wanted to try it out sometime, So, I've ordered Bombay Masala Quesadilla and 4 beans Lasangne. The delivery was quick and prompt. The packing was neat and ensured they served the dishes hot & fresh.
Quesadilla looked like a fusion version of paratha stuffed with unique masala which was quiet filling. Lasange was the best with good amount of cheese and cooked well. Will try pot rice and steak sometime soon.¬†
