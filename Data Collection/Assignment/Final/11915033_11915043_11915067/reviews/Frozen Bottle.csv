"37676965","Ordered a crunchy kit Kat sensation and Was surprised to see ice cream with Oreo. On asking he showed me a tiny piece of kit kat which is not more than a cm as seen in the spoon. Really disappointed and guess what there is no customer service and the franchise guys were arrogant as well . Not ordering any more from frozen bottle . ",1,"2019-04-22 22:57:21",1,12,0
"34462202","Ordered belgian chocolate scoop from frozen bottle. It was really good. Restaurant serves till very late in midnight so its perfect for your late night craving for ice cream.

"39819841","While trying out different places online to order ice creams from, I came across Frozen Bottle. It is mainly known for its shakes, but I happened to order the Belgium Chocolate Ice cream(Double Scoop). It was really rich and creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness. They didn't have options for customization on Zomato except for the scoop size. So, I added the dry fruits myself! But even without the dry fruits, it is really tasty. Make sure you try this out.
Quantity: 4/5
Value For Money: 5/5
Will surely try their shakes soon!",5,"2019-04-02 20:45:22",18,41,2

"54372212","This frozen bottle hotel is near dlf building only.I drank caramel kit Kat milkshake it's good to taste and it is costing around 199rs and you get 300ml.The bottle of this milkshake is very beautifully designed.The ambience is very good it's a small hotel but it's looking good.I have added some more pics here you can see it.I went at evening time they were no waffles and sticks at that time.Only at the night times they are providing waffles.And other things are available here.

"36495441","Absolutely loved their nutty choco jumbo cake in a jar. Beautiful glass jar packaging and chocolicious taste. It's quite rare to enjoy a chocolate delicacy without the sweetness overcoming you. This one is gonna be my guilty pleasure for sure!
We ordered their mango shake as well which too was equally delicious. Definitely ordering or visiting again! ",5,"2019-03-23 05:51:06",140,362,3
"2026080","Received this (see pics for liquid icecream from frozen bottle) on ordering their best selling item Melting pot. That sure looks like worth paying 250 bucks huh?
Trying to speak to Zomato nowadays for any issues , is like speaking to a wall. (See attached screenshot of chat as well). Just hope they publish this review at least.

"38780850","Let's start the war on food (old)
The frozen bottle is quite little palce and they only have 4 seats with modern setup.. I think their main focus is home delivery, they have many options and many recipes blended together.
I ordered Oreo cheese cake shake which was good and came in glass bottle and tasted good with balanced sugar level.
If you are on this way or want to order home delivery to chill out... then give it a try.

"31191916","One of the best places for deserts in this area. This time we tried a new dessert Pizza Ice Cream and it was very yum. If you are not sure on what to have - ice cream , cake or brownies, then go for this. Very creative and Yummy. One slice is enough for one person. We also ordered waffles stick  and got a discount on the bill. The owner is friendly and the place is nicely decorated and have good music. Definitely recommended.",5,"2019-02-16 20:11:41",18,32,4
"382221","I've seen few advertising boards outside a coffee shop & browsed their website & thought this is going to be my next place for icecream. Attraction is cookie jars, it's new kind of experience to have it in glass jar. Thought is going to be huge one but it's just handful, then realised that is perfect quantity. Ordered Red velvet riding jar & Banana Caramel Goodness. Both are awesome especially ending. Next waited sometime for Choco Peanut butter waffle stick surprised to see they have their logo embossed on waffle. It's awesome & tummy full. Keep rocking guys.",5,"2019-01-06 01:02:43",67,142,1

"15670778","Okayish! With so many fabulous outlets of milkshakes, Frozen bottle is the last thing you would want to try.

"888021","A really tiny place, hence, we decided to order home a few shakes from this place. üëåüèº
Berry blast and Filter Kapi were the two choices. The mint choco Shake was always unavailable, hope they increase the availability for that soon. 
Finally got my hands on the mint chocolate another dayyy...delicious! Loved it and ordered using Uber Eats for an amazing price üòç
Snickers super shake- pretty mediocre, has an unpleasantly high snicker taste, I‚Äôd suggest the above three instead! 
Shakes were yum, especially the berry blast Shake. It had really strong flavours. Filter Kapi was just cold coffee, could have been better. The quantity was quite impressive and bottles were packed well. However, the price point is slightly high considering it‚Äôs only a milkshake. ü§≠",4,"2018-11-18 16:31:36",86,215,2

In absolute love with them. We ordered the Red velvet shake which looked very light pink from outside. However it tasted so good, i felt like i was having that wonderful piece of cake itself. Next the Kit-kat Oreo Shake was again a delight. Surely you can go ahead and order from here. These bottles were small sized may be around 300ml.",4,"2018-11-11 23:32:07",139,663,4

"33947690","In the multiple brands of the Glass-Bottled Milkshake companies that have recently grown, Frozen Bottle somewhat fails to stand out. The ice creams offered in jars are not great, the milkshakes though good are not unique to stand out.

"1329235","It is addictive to me, addiction towards milk products is the another love for me. 
Every mid-night with a bottle of flavoured milk. 
The most amazing one we had was chilly chocolate. What a combination, mind blowing combination. Must try once ...
My favourite one is chocolate brownie and Oreo flavour üòãüòãüòã",5,"2018-10-30 00:13:22",15,38,0
"15102371","Frozen bottle is our go-to place (for home delivery) during cricket matches. We have tried several flavor of milkshake and all were decent. Sometimes they add too much of sugar which makes it feel like candy syrup but the chances are less still it should be avoided.
Coming to the menu, I have tried their
Red velvet - This was really good and quite soothing.
Snickers Surprise - this was more of a chocolaty syrup but good in taste.
Nutty chocolate - Decent one and not really sweet.
Thandai - This is our go-to drink but sometimes more sugar ruin the taste completely otherwise this one is really good.
Overall it is a good place to have these milkshakes, will visit the outlet for sure to try other delicacies as most of them can't be delivered at home and hence blocked on the site for ordered. Milkshakes are good and quite value for money specially when being ordered on any offer. ",3,"2018-10-29 01:39:36",362,4095,0

A well trying option. Would surely recommend this place as a must visit to walk-in.
Ambience is soo pleasant and blissful.
Icecream jars are so unique in taste and I must say those are yummy and scrumptious...
Also a wide variety of appetising milkshakes and icecream jars to tempt the tastebuds.

"677679","Our eyes glanced at this place while we were driving from Kondapur to Gachibowli.
The concept of this ice cream bakery is to freeze the glass bottles and then pour milkshake in to it.
They also offer a handful of Ice cream jars and scoops which you can choose as per your taste.
We tried the Choco nutty jumbo which was served in a small jar and had brownie, chocolate ice cream and lot of nuts in it.
In my opinion, there was nothing special about the jar except for the trendy concept that they have. ",3,"2018-10-06 10:45:57",328,1858,2
"53552686","I ordered kesar baadam shake. It was just creamy milk mixed with kesar baadam flavored horlicks. It would cost them around Rs.25.

"1130604","Already a fan of frozen bottle shakes, I visited this outlet as it is in closer proximity. While they maintain quality and hygiene, service is pretty quick as well. Best part I like about them is that they do not ignore you for their online orders. I liked all the shakes I tried here and would visit again to try more. But I feel that their ice cream jar's size is small and even there is scope of improvement in the quality of ice creams they serve.

"32372918","Okay this might be a little biased, but I have a good impression of this place from the get-go. I was craving a dessert one day and chanced upon a frozen bottle cake jar. I loved it, and loved the jar it comes in too. I took my sister today to the store, and I loved it. Simply loved it. The place has a very cosy vibe, which of course comes at the cost of seating capacity (read almost none). The artsy, vintage pop theme interiors, and the very intelligently used bottles, give this a very hep look.
And now coming to the desserts and shake. These fellas seem to have perfected the right amount of ingredients for their shakes and cake jars. I had the Nutty Choco Jumbo and the Litchi Shake. Loved both. The servings are apt for 1 person, assuming you're not a sugar hog. On the downside, it's a tad bit expensive. I hope once they get the ball rolling they slash the prices, a man can wish.
Just one pointer, you're a little short staffed. Or I went on the wrong time. There was only one guy working there and the orders just kept coming in.
Loved everything else.
Cheers.",4,"2018-08-06 00:45:48",4,2,2

We were already full with the above drinks when the Little Red Riding Hood popped up from fancy black cover they provided. And the cute little jar of ice-cream tasted great with the creamy strawberry flavour and the red velvet cake added to it.

I mostly had cake jars. Alphonso mango and nutty choco jumbo cake was nice but I didnt like red riding hood cake in jar..",4,"2018-05-28 17:02:29",9,18,3

"52008327","You are taking a price of 170 for the choclate shake, but the amount and quality is not at all worth the price , it's completely annoying and waste of money. Would never recommend anyone for this restaurant.",1,"2018-05-27 13:57:35",7,4,0

"35313869","We were on a midnight stroll and went to frozen bottle to refresh ourselves. It's a newly opened outlet with various milkshakes options. They are focussed to include other options in near time. We ordered nutty chocolate, thandai and garden strawberry. From price point of view, it's economical as compared to other milkshakes brands but I felt it still was on the higher side.
Talking about taste, I will prefer garden strawberry over others. Nutty chocolate was good but I have had better at other outlets. Thandai milkshake was the basic one. Overall it's a nice option considering they serve till 3 am. ",4,"2018-05-27 01:50:06",1,0,1
