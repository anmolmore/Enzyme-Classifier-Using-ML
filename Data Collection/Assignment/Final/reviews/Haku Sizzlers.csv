"2662708","Average experience. Ordered a veg sizzler and got a non-veg one. But they promptly agreed to the mistake and replaced it. Service is too slow, staff looks inexperienced. Food taste was also average - we ordered Cheesy Corny Kebab with chilly garlic sauce and Chowpatty Style with Schezwan sauce.",3,"2018-12-01 20:58:00",7,22,0

The crispy potato is quite tasty but overpriced for its quantity.",2,"2018-10-20 16:49:26",18,36,3

So it was a long pending visit to #HakuSizzlers and we went there for a dinner this week.
We started with Manchow soup and they have done a great job. A little different in taste from what I generally find outside and was very good.
Next order was Tex mex wings - abhi haku sizzler mein Tex mex kya hain? ü§î They prepare it in Asian style and it was evident with their over usage of soy sauce in it üòÖ I've tried to balance it with pepper sauce on my table and it was great.
How can we miss something that the place is named after? So, we ordered chicken shashlik with schezwan sauce and fish balls with tomato chilli sauce.
Chicken shashlik had very minimal portion of chicken in my view. 3 small chunks of chicken which had traces of schezwan sauce flavor though tasted decent. Rice and vegetables had good amount of schezwan sauce flavor. Potato mash was nothing like a mash and more of finely chopped potato half boiled and pressed ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Fish ball sizzler was a disaster for us considering the smelling fish ( balls were undercooked) and the same potato mash as above. Rice and vegetables were the only saving grace in both Sizzlers. üòï
I have had better Sizzlers in similar price with better quantity and taste. Hopefully, it is a one off for them and expecting to have a better experience in my next visit üôÇ
Total bill was around 970/-",3,"2018-09-21 20:06:51",309,1998,5
"16589305","A new place in the crowded area of Indira Nagar in the same building as Gal Punjab Di and by the same owner. The starter ordered was Hakka Paneer, it was kind of plain just lightly battered and fried along with some greens (very little) the taste was not that great and would suggest to try something else. The sizzler ordered was Mexican Veg Mafia, the rolls were very rubbery and not fresh and not that delectable. The sauce on the contrary was good and rice was to decent enough to have. Overall would suggest you can visit if you lack other options in the area or wanna go just for going then don't order the above dishes.",3,"2018-09-21 15:56:05",57,446,0
"796399","Visited this place for Sunday dinner with family.
The place is nice with quite decent ambiance n polite staff.
Ordered one veg ball sizzler with Noddles in chilly garlic sauce n one paneer sizzler with rice schewan sauce.
Served along with some nice freshly boiled veggies with smoky flavors n french fries.
Everything tasted very well.
Only thing we found a slightest minus is the quantity of the sauce...
Otherwise its all great..
Recommend.
Reasonable
N good quality ingredients.",4,"2018-09-10 19:51:36",4,26,0
"517975","Hands down the best sizzlers I had in Hyderabad (above 100 degree and Kobe's in my view). We ordered three different sizzlers. All of them were pretty good. Not overdone with sauces, with crunchie veggies and tender meat. I could make out different ingredients which I personally prefer in a sizzler instead of a burnt mash of 10 ingredients. Will definitely visit again to try out other options.",5,"2018-09-01 19:21:02",12,40,0

It was one of the best chinese and korean cuisine experience in hyderabad. Visited hyderabad after a long and got time to have lunch here. The sizzler had appropriate smoke. The spices and condiments used were too flavourful. Their dimsums are must try. The staff and the owners are too polite. 
Will visit soon ",5,"2018-08-03 10:01:19",136,320,8

"1130604","Visited this newly opened restaurant with family and friends for Sunday lunch. With seating capacity of around 40 people and simple furniture, painted walls and wall paitings make theme quite attractive. While one would expect few glitches in service in a new restaurant, I found the service good. Menu is pretty impressive with some innovative fusion dishes so we ended up trying almost all that we could guzzle. We started with Veg spinach noodle soup and it was pretty flavorful and soothing. For sides and starters we had Veg Dimsum, french fries, sautee veggies, sautee mushroom, honey chilli potatoes, hakka paneer, makai 3 mirch, Thai Hup babycorn. Most of the starters had very unique flavours of spices and sauces. I particularly liked Hakka Paneer and Makai 3 mirch a lot. All other starters were good too. Thai Hup babycorn could have been better, while even french fries were unconventional but still tasted good. Show stealer of the day came in form of Dal makhni pasta.. unbelievable isn't it? They made it happen and it came out pretty good.
Since Haku's main attraction is sizzler so we wanted to try them out while we were already full. We tried 3 sizzlers - Cheese garlic veg sizzler, Chilli tamarind paneer tikka and cheese corny kofta sizzlers and we liked them. Sizzlers were well prepared with nice smoky flavor and tangy sauces. Mojito and watermelon ginger mocktails complimented food well. For desserts we had sizzling brownie with ice cream and that tasted good too. Overall great experience. Would come back again to try out more. ",4,"2018-07-29 21:54:23",59,578,9
"3176979","Today Lunch scene at Haku Sizzlers
Haku Sizzlers in Gachi Bowli is coming from the group which gave us popular eateries Gal Punjabdi and Jaggi De Paranthe. And Like their earlier restaurants dedicated for Punjabi food and Paranthas, this one is dedicated for some Sizzling n Lipsmacking Sizzlers.
They have got pretty good starters like Fried Corn, French Fries, Hakka Paneer n Chilli Potatoes, Butter Mushrooms n Sauteed Veggies, Hot Chicken Wings, Mint Soya Fish.
Dimsums need special mentioning as they were soft, mildly spiced fillings accompanied with Sauce
Main course consisted of Delicious Pasta in creamy White Sauce, Noodles Paired with Mildly seasoned Veg and Non Veg Schezwan Sauces.
The Sizzling Hot Sizzlers were too good.
Chilli Garlic Sizzler, Paneer Tikka Sizzler are a must try for Veg lovers and for nonveggies their Chicken Tikka n Chicken Meatballs sizzlers were served with Nicely done veggies, Rice n Noodles. Portion size is enough of two moderate eaters.
Finally finished the lunch with one of the best Sizzling Brownie with Ice Cream n Ice Cream with fried Noodles in recent times..
Overall a good refreshing place and If you are looking for some decent sizzlers, noodles n Dimsums in Gachi Bowli n surrounding areas, one should head to Haku..
While we are busy relishing the dishes, entrance was buzzing with Swiggy n Zomato deliveries flying off the kitchens of Haku n Gal PunjabDi",5,"2018-07-29 21:50:00",33,320,8
