"31048467","I have booked for a corporate lunch at this place. When we went to this place to be frank we are with zero expectations on this but at the end the of our lunch all my teammates are happy with this place. Best part here is their starters, desserts and chat items. Here jelebi with rabdi is extremely super üòã. Service was bit slow but their respect towards customers made us forget that. Only area where they can improve is the main course options. Thanks Indi Grill for giving us one of the finest lunches ever we had.",4,"2019-05-16 18:46:20",2,56,0

A great variety in the grill items however the deserts could have been a little less sweeter. The dishes well liked were crispy corn, green apple fox, and angoori gulab jamun. Ice creams and custard lacked their respective flavours which was a disappointment. Surely would like to visit again expecting the above changes are made. :)",5,"2019-05-08 22:29:51",3,1,0

"45194909","Went with our friends for a casual lunch on Friday 
As usual it was Soo rush and waiters and staff over there are in hurry to serve us fast and want to throw us out of the restaurant.üòê
Yeahh it‚Äôs fine we can understand but there should be a polite way to convey the same,it should not be like ur time is done..leave now..leave now...
That is a negative of the management over there.
Coming to the food
For veg..the starters are only 3....potato..crispy corn and mushroom and on the grill pineapple and paneer. Not a worthy starters for veg
For non veg...starters were good..there are all varieties of non vegetarian on grill and served in plates
Main course...Not at all worthy...and not tasty..ü§¢
Only one rice item..tasteless and curries and other items were not tasty
Salads were good
Chat items not worthy 
Deserts are good..3 desi sweets and as usual pastries cakes and pudding 
And lastly the people working over there forces us to give 5 rating on zomato even before we complete our lunch and leave out.
They want us to give the rating infront of them

"1662729","Went for a lunch Buffet yesterday and we were around 17 ppl.
The best part is they mention the name and place allocated on the entrance.
Ambiance is good and they welcomed with a mocktail.
Coming to starters, non veg was awesome and veg starters looked quite ok. But they can introduce something new as its same everywhere.
We have chicken wings, chicken kabab, fish, prawns. They were just amazing.
We have Tawa chicken and Prawns but that was not up to the mark and that Tawa items needs a huge change in taste.
Main course was above average and they had some amazing dishes like Laal Maas(mutton), prawns were awesome(love to visit again to eat this amazing prawns)
Coming to Desserts, they were just melting in mouth, my all time favourite Jilebi with Rabdi, asked for some hot Jilebi at the end as well, I got a few.
Kheer was ok, gulab jamun was good.
Overall experience is good. It needs some minor changes in few dishes.

"2433000","This was totally an accidental visit,i had no idea about this place before we stepped into this one except for the fact that it's a bbq place,as the name suggests.It's two floored building beautifully lit,i was here for dinner.We opted for first floor,they immediately got the grill and the buffet starts.It's like any other bbq place but with high quality food.The starters are so very fresh,i definitely give it one of the best bbq places in the city.The menu was pretty much the same,the chicken wings deserves a special mention,we repeated it like 3 times 'AWE'mazing.The main course was decent,the dessert section was again okay specially -pan shot-was like a panflavoured liquid in shot glasses and i loved it.Everything was pretty much decent but what made me love this place more was the service.The service is amazing,shout out to ASHRAF AND REETHAM.They made our experience more pleasant. The only complain about this place is the playlist,(more of old and sad bollywood songs) it was so loud and it totally is a huge off.I suggest please change the playlist guys,it's ruining the whole vibe of the place,this is the first time i had to bear music instead of enjoying it.Anyways,i liked the unexpected visit to this place.

"719520","We were 31 people went together for a lunch buffet on 22nd April. Tables were arranged on 1st floor for us and no one else were allowed which is a plus for big group. Coming to menu its kind of same what all bbq places are offering now a days. Taste was good for most of the items. Staffs were polite and quick on services. Only thing which didnt went well was AC of the resturant. As it was a hot afternoon, AC was not enough to cool us downüòï. Manger apologized for this. They also gave us a 10% off on total bill because of 20+ people.
Advices to management = Please have some unique food item which is not there on other places.
Looking forward to visit again. ",4,"2019-04-30 11:19:02",17,126,1

"1419901","After hearing good reviews about this, we went for lunch buffet. First and foremost thing you will notice is the courteousness of the staff there. Once you book the table, they write your name on a board outside. We took the seat in the first level as the ground floor was full. Starters were served. Veg starters were too spicy,but very tasty. Its better you mention them the spice level before itself. Even main course was pretty good in terms of taste. Nothing much special in the menu but taste and staff were good.

"34457388","After months of trying out buffet restaurants in and around Gachibowli, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that EVERYTHING about The Indi Grill was worth the visit. One of the rare places where you'll find consistent quality across dishes - starters, main course, and dessert. Jalebi does require a special mention.
Combine this with courteous staff who ensure you have a good time right from the moment you step in and you have the perfect experience.
I would recommend visiting the place in the first slot, as things are reasonably quiet. Not surprised at all that the second slot starts getting crowded!
If I had to be really critical, the veg menu has that tiny scope of improvement in an otherwise perfect place. Keep it going!",5,"2019-04-26 21:50:29",4,3,0

When it comes to spread of items, they were just too many. Barbeque items, main course as well as desserts. The taste was however was not to the level of satisfaction. Ambience was just average.
Service definitely needs a heavy improvement. We went on a non rush day, serving of barbeque items were over flowing in the first and single service. There is no concept of coming to the table second time. No one really really bothered the table. Even after requesting so many times, servers really didn't bother much to serve breads in the table or refilling any barbeque items. We just had to go with the main course to continue our lunch.

"1883970","This is located prominently along the main road and is a part of the same group which has the Moti Mahal chain of restaurants.
Hopped in for lunch on a weekday after a movie at the nearby mall and it was a good experience to put it across in a lucid manner. The starters have mostly the usual fare you'd see in a typical barbeque restaurant. There was chicken, fish, prawn, mutton seekh kebab, chicken tangdi, chicken meat balls etc. in the non veg fare. The veg had the typical paneer, pineapple, corn on the cob, crispy potatoes in sauce which I would say were delectable along with the crispy corns. There is a complimentary mocktail which was decent but the masala coke I ordered later had too much masala and too little fizz for my liking.
The chats were toothsome and lip smackingly tasty. I also liked the kulchhas and parathas in the main course. They were soft and had the right texture and taste. Just the way they should be. Special mention of the veg and non veg manchow soup which was appetizing. My wife had multiple rounds of the same. The chicken, fish and mutton curries were good but I liked the dal makhni and matar methi malai among the lot. The gulab jamun and halwa along with the jalebi and rabdi were supremely delicious in the desserts section.
The service was quick and prompt. Special mention of Raghuveer Singh who took care of our requirements and was always available when required. This is not a big place hence the ambiance is not much to talk about. They have seating on the first floor too which is an added bonus. All in all, this is definitely a place worth trying!",4,"2019-04-11 11:41:11",106,634,2
"15714368","Located in the busy streets of kondapur this one gains quite an attention
Indigrill is a chain of the grand Moti Mahal restaurants
Set up in ground and first floors has a decent ambience
For present they are only running buffet section but they are going to start A-la-carte soon
.
.
We have been invited to try their buffet section
Welcomed by the friendly staff we have been served first with their welcome drink
Then moving on to the grill they had chicken fish and prawns on BBQ in non veg
Fish and prawns tasted great while chicken was a little hard
In vegetarian paneer mushroom and pineapple were served
Apart from grill they had other starters too
Mutton sheek kabab served here is one of the best I ever had
Fresh minced mutton made into soft kebabs tasted amazing
And crabs were little but slow cooked and  prepared in such a way that the flesh comes off easily tasted amazing
.
.
We were almost filled with starters but their main course spread is huge too
My favorites were
Crab curry and mutter paneer
.
.
And in desserts 
Gulad jamun and jilebi with rabdi were lip smacking
Strawberry pudding and phirni tasted good too",4,"2019-04-10 17:49:12",107,616,27

"4532951","Question: How do you go wrong with a barbecue-on-table kind of buffet restaurant in this area?
Answer: You don't.
I would rate the place a 3.5 out of 5, as it offers something extra for the same price, and is a change from the existing joints.
Moti Mahal is an iconic chain of restaurants, and The Indi Grill is their latest offering, located right on the main road, near Radisson. This is its vantage point - easily accessible to the corporate offices for lunches. The prices are also reasonable, mid-range sort of. I loved how bright and well-lit the place was, and the glass walls giving you a view of the outside.
The food drill was pretty much the same as usual. There are some starters that are served, and some that are put on the grill on your table. Former included: crispy corn, cajun potatoes, honey chilli potatoes, bhutani veg and the latter comprised of Achari paneer tikka, mushroom, pineapple, and grill vegetables. Their Sunday menu is more extensive, and includes a lot more dishes.
The live tawa items were also good, but what stole the show was the chaat! The variety and the taste is typical north Indian, and was totally relished. From the mains, my favourite picks were Methi Matar Malai, and the noodles.
Alongwith the food, you get a complimentary mocktail, and the 3 that we tried were all good, especially the Pina Colada.
The desserts had pastries, besides some meringue, swiss rolls, puddings and brownie. The highlight of the day for me were the Indian desserts! The phirni was amazing and the rabri that they had to go alongside the jalebi was quite authentic in taste. The jalebi could have been more warm to be enjoyed, but the rabri made up for it. The pan shots could have been better; they were a bit too liquid-y.
The place is better for non-vegetarians in terms of the variety and taste, but the chaat and desserts make it up for the vegetarians as well!",4,"2019-04-08 09:38:42",150,2105,21
"9326051","The buffet spread is not that great if I compare it to similar options like Absolute Barbeque or Barbeque Nation. The starters were tasted good however the maincourse and deserts were sheer disappointment. However a special note of thanks to them for providing me a complimentary cake on my birthday and giving me a  great applause!!",3,"2019-04-07 23:57:42",71,69,0

"873715","We came here for Sunday lunch and as it turns out, it only serves buffet. We had two buffet non-veg lunch, total amount being Rs. 1354 (incl. Taxes).
Pros:
1. Very soft, spicy and large variety of starters, my fav being prawns and crispy corn.
2. Lot of varieties of both non-veg & veg and a rare occasion when i found crab curry in buffet. Tasty stuff.
3. Good attitude of staff especially Sahil.
Cons:
1. Dessert was not fresh and did not taste good.
2. The seating on upper floor is too small and confined.",4,"2019-04-07 18:52:32",40,32,3

It's a newly opened place, so it wasn't very crowded on a Saturday afternoon. It's very nicely decorated, the interiors are really nice.
As of the menu, the do not have a lot of variety like Barbeque nation, however wherever they served was good.
I was surprised that they were serving rabbit too in non veg.
Was a little disappointed from the desserts section, the pastries and shots were not upto the mark.
Good experience.

"849785","People Might get offended but I did not eat free here to just describe this place as a great but the place is just negligible.¬†
Been here for lunch¬†buffet when the Kashmiri¬†food festival was running the food was just okay in fact nothing great in so-called Kashmiri¬†style.¬†
Keeping the food aside there was no proper power backup¬†while eating the ac was off for close to 20 mins and minimum things are lacking. There was no hygiene in the hotel it was pathetic and the saddest part of all is people not even trying to get things sorted at the earliest when power is gone.¬†
I can only describe the situation as pathetic and worst I would 100 per cent recommend people to see that they get the basic things right and see people don't suffer.
I would 100 percent¬†ask for a refund of the total bill paid without a second doubt but people feel offended if asked.
