"51602087","New york Slice...a brand that is fast growing and gaining prominence across twin cities. usually it is known for their jumbo slices offering and authentic American pizzas.
their newly opened outlet at nanakramguda has nice ambience and positive vibe to dine in.
this time I wish to try their pastas. had creamy Alfredo pasta and it recalled my dine in experience in Italy. one of the great pastas ever I had. perfect mix of veggies, cream and pasta.
ginger mint punch has perfect mix of ginger and mint worked well for the tongue and throat to feel the effect.
their milkshakes also looks to be decent. tried roasted hazelnut and it is very soothing. ",5,"2019-05-18 19:55:01",3,1,5
