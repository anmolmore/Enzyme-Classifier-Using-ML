"92782786","Today I have ordered one chicken pizza, 8"", 1 paneer pizza 12"" and garlic masala bread. They took 1 hour 15 minutes to deliver. The quality and taste are below average. Compared to leaders Pizza Crust stands very poor and abominable. I ordered for my daughter who came from US. She had to starve.",1,"2019-05-18 22:18:39",1,0,0

The chef Jalaluddin Khan took extra care to make the best pizza for me as per my instructions & he also accomodated my special requests to change toppings. I loved the pizza & the hospitality. Great experience. Yummy pizza",5,"2019-05-01 23:32:22",4,24,0

"102462401","I ordered 1 regular pizza and they delete it very late and the pizza is overcooked. The bread is too hard to cut from your teeth. Also the size will be very small. I request people not to order from this place. Even when I asked for my money back as I have ordered from zomato. In chat when I raised the issue, the agent knowingly responding late and he said you will not face this in future. When I asked for my return he said that we cannot pressurise restaurant. So we cannot pay. ",1,"2019-04-17 20:10:58",2,0,0

"52392029","Ordered 6 inch Tandoori Paneer and Veg Pizzas. These are the worst Pizzas I ever hard. Pizza base is just bread, it is not actual base made of proper dough. And the so called base was burnt heavily. Tasteless burgers. If this is the quality of the food, then forget about customers",1,"2019-04-14 06:49:57",12,3,0

"37553587","This is what cheese garlic bread looks like. Cheese and garlic is not added while baking. Cheese and garlic is just stuck after making. Taste of pizza is worst. And cheese dip doesn't even has cheese in it. It is made of some weird tasting ingredient.",1,"2019-02-24 21:55:50",4,7,1
