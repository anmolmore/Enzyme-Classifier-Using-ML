Ambiance-
Publick Restaurant is located Gachibowli and has one of the best ambiance. They has beautiful decoration with no crowd at all. Indoor sitting arrangement is available including chairs and couch, but no music in the background. While we reached there, we didn't see any other customer dining there.
Food-
Worst ever!!!
We placed an order for Chicken Angara Kebab which was served cold and which was not properly cooked and chilly was added on top. We requested that order to replace, but again same food was served. We also placed an order for Chicken Afgani was was topped with an omelette. Chicken Afgani served by them was the worst dish I ever had. Butter naan was too cold and became papad.
Service-
Service was so bad that a waiter was not properly trained to served, and we had to serve ourselves.
Overall-
This restaurant doesn't even deserve a single star.",1,"2019-01-14 02:53:06",101,332,8
"7677441","How on earth is this place rated 4 on Zomato?
Lesson learnt:do not trust Zomato ratings.
Went there for dinner.
There were a lot of warning signs which I didn't pay heed to.
1)As soon as you enter you can see the kitchen door open.Not a pretty sight .
2)The plates had dust settled on them which were promptly replaced but the reason given was that they have been unused for long which was bizarre.
3)Ordered a coke got a thumbs up instead.
4)Ordered butter naan ,mixed veg and dal makhani. butter naan was decent.ive had better dal makhani.Now coming to the shocking part -the mixed veg had was spoilt.It literally had a stench.It was promptly refunded.
5)very slow service inspite of it being empty.The extra butter naan never came.
All in all never going back to this place.",1,"2019-01-07 00:33:30",6,3,0

"37966280","We wanted to try this place sonce it was new and reviews were kind of good. The place was empty for a saturday, which was surprising.
Ambience wise it was pretty good, green n blue was pleasing for the eyes.
Service was decent , they were ready to take the order or serve without we searching for them.
Coming to the Food it was not so great, we had ordered kadai paneer, chicken lollipop and butter naan. Chicken lollypop was doughy, paneer in the curry was rubbery may be cooked for too long or not fresh. It might be a one off since saw good reviews for the same dishes in other posts but we were not so happy coming out.
Finally, Prices were decent, it costed around 550rs for the items we ordered with additional 10% discount by the restaurant (may be promotional).",3,"2018-10-09 21:26:49",2,4,3

"36117048","This was our second visit here. The ambience is retro themed and decent. Quality of service is commendable and so is the food. There were not many patrons around both the times we visited. I expect the restaurant to retain the same level of quality of service and food even as footfalls increase in the future.

"47193507","I visited today for lunch.
AMBIANCE - It was beautiful, bright and greenery. I took the outside sitting where there is little green plans which made me feel calm and fresh. I liked the use of blue colour everywhere, blue walls, lamps etc.
FOOD - I ordered Jeera rice, kadai Panner, butter garlic naan and tandoori mashroom. Butter garlic naan was super awesome. The quantity of tandoori mashroom was very less and taste was just OK.
SERVICE - Service was little slow. I was sitting in outside sitting area. I couldn‚Äôt see waiters from there, so it was very difficult to call them. Most of the time there was no one who attended me. I had to go and call them to take order or to know the status of order. Waiters were polite and friendly.
PRICE - It is reasonable. It costed 650 bucks for all the food I ordered. Moreover, they gave me 15% discount without even asking for it üôÇ
Overall, it is a good place to go if you are looking for good food with reasonable price. ",3,"2018-09-28 18:34:03",3,1,0
"43094990","Visited this place for lunch today.
AMBIANCE:
Pretty cool. Bright, colorful, and enough seating.
Located on the second floor.
SERVICE:
Really really slow. We were the only people there at that time, and after placing our order, they took around half an hour.
Apart from their 'slowness' in serving the food, the waiters were helpful and very prompt in everything else.
FOOD:
We ordered butter naans along with 2 gravy: Methi chicken and Butter chicken. These were made to perfection and were my favorite part of the lunch here.
We also had chicken biryani. I felt it was a bit dry. The accompanying raitha and chutney were well made though.",3.5,"2018-09-18 23:29:26",123,1658,10
"32582187","The Ambience is very good.
The lighting is great but the only thing I didn't like was I ordered veg biryani and it had lot of cauliflower stuffed in it wid lot of masala. There was no aloo other than only cauliflower.
In pic is the Veg Noodles which was not too soft.",3,"2018-09-18 09:38:31",8,99,1

Another addition to gachibowli street and it's a beautiful addition. The lights, the colour blue, the pots hanging from the ceiling, the blue sofa giving a vintage look, the place looks beautiful yet simple. You can get amazing pictures here. I got awesome snaps.it has a big dining area and a balcony seating.
Moving to food, we ordered veg nuggets, aloo pyaz ki tikki, masala kulcha, rotis, kadai paneer, dal makhni and lemonade.they serve complimentary roasted dry papads. Starters we're yummy, loved both. The curriers were good too. I liked dal makhni more. Food was good overall. We were so full, we could not order desserts. It was around 700 bucks for all that we eat which I thought wasn't overpriced.
The staff were good. They kept asking for feedback many a times. They we're friendly. We took the balcony seating and it was many a times difficult to call the waiter.
I went few weeks back, it wasn't that Crowded then maybe coz it was new. I had a good time. Try this place out @publick ",4,"2018-09-15 22:20:00",174,1283,8
