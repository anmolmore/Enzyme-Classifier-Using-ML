Got message at 6 that it is out for delivery. Just bake guys called at 8 to get the directions ",1,"2018-08-02 21:00:49",1,1,0

"53771999","First what I have ordered, they said that it will take 3 hrs to deliver.. I thought it's ok, but they called after 2 hours and said that it was not available. I donot know whatbtge HELL they were doing in that 2 hrs !!!!
now coming to the delivery, they didn't bother to say that they were going to be late by 30-40 minutes (over that 3 hrs.). I was waiting for them and toy surprise the Just Bake even tried to pick my call when I tried to contact them. thanks to the Zomato support team, they came handy and they did rest of the job. finally after 3-4 hours I got the cake which I haven't ordered at first. 
But, one thing I will praise...the cake was awesome..very good in taste as well looks.. that's why I gave 3 star, rest the service SUCKs...",3,"2018-05-19 22:32:24",5,1,0

"27562729","I am short of words to express my disappointment with the service of Just Bake, Gachibowli. I live in dubai and wanted to order a cake for my brothers birthday. After a lot of conversation n literally pestering over whatspp it was come to a conclusion that my cake would be delivered at 11 30 in the night. ( that's when u usually want to wish your friends n loved ones!!!! At the stroke of 12!!!)  I was made to pay extra charges for the 2 kg cake for a 'special midnight delivery'!  And then finally I come to know through my ppl that the cake was delivered at 7 30 pm!  Much to my disappointment ðŸ™„ðŸ˜•  Ruined my entire plan of surprising my brother. On asking them,I got a one word reply on whatsapp: APOLOGIES!  who is answerable for this callous approach?!  I demand for a reimbursement and a better apology for ruining  one of the best days of my life! ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡",1,"2018-01-19 12:17:34",1,16,0
"204895","Been here to celebrate an office colleagues birthday had a very bad experience literally one of my colleague got a house fly while eating the cake.. We wanted to give this place a second chance so we went again this time though the cake they served looked fresh it was having a foul smell.. We have decided that they wonâ€™t improve and this place is a bad option for cakes or any savoury they would only serve old stock",1,"2018-01-19 08:38:30",4,38,0
"29287577","Really bad service.. Though I am a fan of the cakes they prepare but they are really really bad at taking order and delivering it. They must understand the value of a commitment.. If you want anything from this restaurant then you should just go there and get it.. Apparently these guys are from the ice age.. Don't know how to use technology to deliver cakes without the person coming to their restaurant in person",1,"2017-08-17 18:22:22",3,4,0

For a change, i liked it.
It was soft, creamy, chocolaty and too yummy.
The chocolate crumbles were really fresh and tasted great.

"32393234","Bought dark chocolate cake 1kilo for my friends birthday. We were totally dissatisfied with the quality of the cake because the cake was hard and we were unable to taste it.

"33801655","Very Poor response from Just Bake Gachibowli, when I reached their shop that time there is no cake in their stock, they told to leave mobile number and they will call back when the cake will come to their shop and will arrange home delivery.
after long waiting they did not call back , when I called them they told home delivery is not possible now, my suggestion if you are unable to deliver then please do not make any false statement.",1,"2016-03-08 14:15:30",1,0,0
"4532951","Yesterday was my first visit to this joint. After a hearty dinner, we ended up here, looking for some desserts.Â 
The place had barely any customers in the seating area. We took a White Forest piece, which was pretty decent, and a Vanilla cupcake, that felt like love!Â 
Because we were full, but wanted to try out more, we had another Vanilla cupcake packed, along with a chocolate cupcake and a lemon tart. The chocolate cupcake had a bit of too dark chocolate, and the lemon tart was likable.Â 
Pleasant experience overall, that cost us 200 bucks.",3.5,"2016-02-07 14:15:01",150,2105,1
"1084337","We were looking for a small birthday cake of half kg. We went to a lot of bakeries but could only find chocolate or butterscotch cake of half kg in that area. We then went into this bakery to check it out. 
We found this place decently spaces out..lot of seating place..but empty ...it as around 9pm. They had many flavours of cake of half kg. Being tempted by appearance and variety ...we took blueberry cake.
When we reached home and had that cake...it was not at all good. Nobody liked it...it was just a sponge cake with lot of cream and blueberry jam. 
Not recommended.",2,"2016-02-05 18:16:43",63,203,0
"1270124","It's a very decent place to go. It is never crowded and you can have a little extra time if you take a date along.
The cakes and pastries are good. So are the cupcakes and muffins. I have has their snacks a few times. They were not as good as the sweet items though.
The part which I like most is that they were open to customize the birthday cake with a funky look and they even laughed it out with us. (Probably, because they do not have a rush.)",4,"2016-01-30 17:20:59",80,70,0
"32999630","Pathetic experience. I have ordered a cake through on-line and paid the amount. They sent a mail it will be delivered in 2 hours. After 2 hours when I called them they said it will be delivered in an hour. After that no one took my call.Its been 30 hours since I ordered I don have any information regarding my cake. My suggestion is to never order from JUST BAKE. My order no. is :JBED0019701.

"27894707","I love the death by chocolate pastry and chocolate muffins. The muffins for sure are better then hyped places like karachi bakery. Although the snacks were more worth the price when this outlet was new, dont know why they repriced all the stuff.
The cakes are also great, specially the point that they deliver it to corporate offices. Saves a lot of time.",3.5,"2015-04-09 01:44:06",276,1753,0
"2020038","Had the most repulsive Red Velvet cake here. We had come with high hopes of satiating our sweet tooth. To start with, they didnt even have a decent spread of pastries. The red velvet cake and  blueberry pastry we bought turned out to be stale and the icing was dry and stiff. Overall bad experience and unreasonably priced high for such awful tasting confectionery.",1,"2015-04-02 22:07:37",10,83,0

"11344631","Just Bake in Hyderabad is not living up to its great reputation in Bangalore !
This particular outlet is pretty spacious & has okayish ambience & is not really kept neat & clean.
Staff seemed pretty dis interested, only one guy at the end of the large counter looking lost was what I found when I entered.
After browsing through the options available at the counter, decided to try veg puff & an item which was Paneer based & looked like a Calzone(it did not have a name on it !).
Veg Puff was decent, however the Paneer item was ridiculous. For the price they charge, having these sub standard items is unwise.
Haven't ordered a cake from them yet, but I am not sure if I would want to.
Will rate the place a 2 on 5 & may not return, unless I start hearing good things.",2,"2014-12-21 18:42:31",213,466,0

"1464344","I actually gone here for buying a birthday cake for one of my close friend i had earlier good experience with them in bangalore so trusted the name but really it was little bit  disappointed but not dat much... it was okay better den some previous cakes from other bakery in hyderabad...... the thing which i liked here is veg puff it was really nice...... I had never had this much good puff earlier.... but some time they ruined the puff.. I dont know why but they keep puff and Croissant into micrcowave and which will make it soft and that you cant eat because the crispiness of that has gone nowfuninkafino.blogspot.com",3,"2014-06-11 23:28:27",107,1444,4
"682986","Paneer puff was just about okay. Paneer bhurji was stuffed inside instead of paneer pieces. Ordered chocolate temptation and chocolate cup cake. Chocolate temptation was more of regular chocolate pastry with creamy chocolate on top. chocolate cup cake was pretty good.  The lower part was a bit on the harder side. But the delicious upper layer makes up for it . Go to just bake if you are crazy for fancy cakes.  I guess this is the only bakery in hyd which bakes a cake in formula 1 car shape.

"1789245","Went to Just Bake, Gachibowli for dessert last night with a group of friends. Ordered a sundae and was halfway through it when i bit on something that certainly wasnt ice cream. Turned out it was a STAPLE PIN. The staff at that time was clueless about what to do and just brushed matters aside. Still to call the manager and see what he has to say.
Taste is inconsequential if they cant keep STAPLE PINS out of their ice cream
Very Disappointed!!",2.5,"2014-03-23 12:24:50",4,4,0
"170269","Yesterday was one of those days where i was making a string of bad food decisions. Started with Over The Flames and ended at Just back.
After a disastrous pizza outing at OTF, i moved to just bake for some dessert but looked at the ice cream and was intrigued by the presentation and color.
The place is huge with atleast a seating capacity for 50 ppl. Has a long range of cakes and bakes to choose from but then i was fixated on the ice cream.
I chose the ""Say Cheese"" ice cream.  The bakery had just opened at 12, the guy at the counter - yawning and totally disoriented.
I asked him a few thing and he was not sure and had to check.
SayCheese is a combo os blueberry cheese cake , red velvet and cheese sauce.
The combination sounds funny, but its even more funnier to eat. 
THe ice cream as such is so crumbly and grainy, it leaves a bad after taste in your mouth. The cheese sauce is of cheap quality. The waffle bowl doesn't even soak up the melting ice cream ! 
As much as i was interested looking at the pictures. the food is a total let down.
Tread with care, ensure freshly baked items are purchased.thegastronomix.net",2,"2014-02-25 10:37:22",305,2418,1
"322926","I dropped by this place after ordering take away at Delhi 39.
I couldn't help, but notice the brand-new-looking awning over the front door, and I always make it a point to support new businesses that are willing to brave the downtown area.
The moment I stepped in I grabbed the menu immediately, then the guy behind the counter said most of the things on the menu are not available. The one that are in the display are only available as of now, then I grabbed other menu which was of ice cream section and ordered fruit overload and to my surprise even it was not available.  Maybe it was because I came pretty late (~9pm), and the offerings were limited, then my focus went straight to the pastries, and I have to say I was underwhelmed.
I tried the blueberry gateaux  I heard about this cake it will Melt in your mouth, but my pastry was stale. Incredibly tough, and it was beyond sad that the top frosting was hard. How old does a pastry have to be for the top to be hard? Three days? Five days? A week? I haven't a clue, but I do know that a pastry selling should be baked and served the same day. The texture of the pastry was off. Not moist, too sour, and flavors very 1-dimensional, the blueberry sauce on the top was flaky and not to mention SMALL For 63 INR, the size certainly didn't make for it. If I'm going to be paying that much for each pastry, if the size doesn't make up for it, then the flavors better be mind blowing.
Service: It was self-service and they are fast and quick though.
Ambiance: The shop itself is spacious, but still very quaint.
I see that I am not the first to vote this place as I thought I would be, looks like someone squeezed in just ahead of me. Oh well, at least I can take some comfort in the fact that mine is the first review.
P.S: I have visited here just once, so I will hold off on a recommendation.",2,"2014-01-27 18:55:14",123,9217,1
