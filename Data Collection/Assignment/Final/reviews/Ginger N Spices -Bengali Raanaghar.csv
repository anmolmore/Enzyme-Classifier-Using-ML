"3032462","I was quite excited to find a bengali food joint near Gachibowli. I have ordered 2 plates of fish fry from here. One plate or one piece of fish fry worth ₹75 seemed little costly to me. From the aftertaste of the fishes one can easily figure out that the oil used for frying was not good. My order was too small to write a review about. Hope the other items are nice and worth the price.",3,"2018-03-20 17:15:41",146,332,1
"34352584","This place seems like it has a lot of potential but needs guidance. I have ordered four times from here just to make sure rhat the review i write today would not be based on eating from here once but be an honest average review.
The first time i ordered was a chicken special thali. It was so salty that no amount of lemon or drinking water could fix it
The second time i ordered the same, and before i ordered i called the restaurant and spoke to the owner, who made sure that the special chicken thali wont be salty. Which thankfully wasnt.
Third time thinking things are for the better and this is the only bengali restaurant in gachibowli that i can order from i ordered chicken kosa and rice. Chicken kosa was for ₹100 but the quantity made me think i paid ten bucks for it.
Last and final time was at around 11:30 at night . This one made sure that i never even try to order from here again. I ordered murgh mussalam, chicken bengali gravy and chicken paratha. There was hardly any chicken in the paratha, hardly any gravy in the bengali chicken gravy and murgh mussalam is not something i would pay ₹150 above bucks for which i did. The most horrible part was that through all these orders one thing remained clear. The chicken pieces were pieces which a normal restaurant would never serve all the time. Neck pieces mostly. It makes ma sad to even think about it.
I understand this is a new restaurant, but please keep a check in your quantity and quality. Its not fair to you or me to have a bad experience again n again.
Ps when i called to make sure about the salt, the restaurant owner offered complimentary jhuri aloo.
Just a suggestion, jhuri aloo is crispy. Not soaked with oil and moist. I thank you for it, but it wasn't enjoyable.
Thanks and good luck

"37931489","Try to watch the balance of salt in your thalis. Its either too much or too less. Ordered yesterday. Not that great as i expected it to be but thats okay you are new, trying to help out. Less salt is better though. You can add it. But more, doesnt help. Your mishti doi is good but the authentic mishti doi is never white and mixed with sugar. Its a beautiful caramel curd. Good luck. Hope next time i order your dishes will be more delicious ",3.5,"2018-03-09 13:46:00",1,2,0
