"61996579","the name resembles this place with their prices(Skyhy).Very bad experience, worst food, worst service. We ordered spicy grill chicken, we couldn‚Äôt differentiate whether it was chicken or some other cheap meat. The fish fingers were oily as Hyderabad‚Äôs summer sweat! üòÇ. I would rate 0/5 for this place",1,"2019-05-12 20:50:33",2,1,0

OK kind of for your money as I am comparing other places in same area",3,"2019-04-30 00:57:22",99,106,0

"50529300","Pathetic. Unprofessional staff. Bouncers will make you wait for 15-20 mins at the entrance even if you have made an advance booking for office party. Moreover, they ask to call any member from your group who is already in to verify whether booking is done or not, party is going on or not. If it was my personal party I would have immediately cancelled the booking and have gone somewhere else. ",1,"2019-03-08 12:57:42",7,10,0

"98927731","Very overpriced diluted drinks. On complaining the bartender said, it has very high alcohol content, blah blah and we don't know how the cocktails are made. Very arrogant and rude staff. The order took forever to come. Not sure if this is a Saturday night rush issue or a regular thing.¬†
When our order finally arrived, they got it wrong.
The dance floor was very crowded and some people were pushing us.
The only good part was 2+2 with zomato gold.
In the final bill, they charged us for 6 extra drinks and refused to update bill.
If you are a party of 4-5 people, please avoid this place.",1,"2019-03-06 00:47:21",1,0,0

"16097008","I had been to this place last weekend with family. I must say the service is excellent. Coming to the ambience, the dance floor and the area beside that looks great, but the rooftop wasn't that interesting. 1 less star only for that. But other than that the food was good but not that great. We ordered:
1. Budweiser (3)
2. Virgin Mojito (2) - It was soooooo good.
3. Chicken Tikka - Could have cooked more.
4. Crispy chicken Asian Style
5. Dragon Chicken
6. Chicken pulao - Same as Biryani nothing great
Overall, I feel a little more work to be put into deco on the rooftop & a little on food. But a good open air experience. Best if you come as a couple. The dance floor will be open to you.",3,"2019-02-28 21:12:30",94,496,2

The DJ was so bad. He didn't play any requested songs.
He mixed all the songs which didn't set the mood right and ruined all the trippy songs by making them fast and adding beats eg for Manali trance, he made it fast.

There are multiple events going on this place, make it more interesting. The dance floor is big and closed to give u the thumping sound. There is a huge screen for live matches.
Food: I have loved the food here be it veg or non veg. Fish is quite good. The masala level is decent. Liquor collection is good. But I don't find cocktails much interesting here.

"30171042","Firstly the pictures that they have put up makes this place looks brightly light but it is kind of dark and the ambiance is not exactly as portrayed. Not very crowded which makes it spacious enough. Food is okay but the service was pathetic. When asked for spoons, the waiter asked us to use the serving spoon instead. There was a lot of delay in service and mismanagement.",2,"2018-09-28 03:47:28",96,350,0

"38233169","TLDR : an avg place with¬† moderately expensive drinks¬† ( a LIT in pictures at 550¬† )¬†A nice club with good ambiance , but they closed the roof top due to less crowd on a SATURDAY night . It was a happening place earlier , which couldn't cope up with new upcoming competition around it . The chicken wings were undercooked .¬†The only good thing about the place was the energetic DJ with crazy numbers & the dance floor .¬†The staff were not friendly because they tried to stop me & another blogger from taking pictures & videos of the place multiple times after even mentioning that we were lifetstyle/food bloggers (maybe they might have had a misconception initially ) .",2,"2018-09-20 16:30:35",49,283,2
