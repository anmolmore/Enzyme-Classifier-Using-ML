"213321","Big fan of All day Breakfast in bed? Order from this amazing little eatery!
From vegetarian heart shaped nutella pancakes to a classic English breakfast with omelettes and hash browns they‚Äôve got it all. 
They also have a dine-in available if you wish to drop by. Not to mention the place also whips up some amazing shawarma and rice combos. 
Juices to coffee, they‚Äôve got everything you need.  All this without burning a hole in your pocket. 
In picture:
I had ordered their Nutella Pancakes and coffee: the packaging was perfect and the Nutella was well smothered. The coffee hadn‚Äôt leaked either. 
While the pancakes were true to being eggless the baking soda/powder was slightly overpowering. But still manages to be one of the best eggless pancakes joint for me. ",4,"2019-04-14 10:31:16",96,1068,2
"80535410","As of now, I have tried 2 rice bowls and 1 shawarma from here -
1) non veg green slimy monster bowl
2) veg the iron monster bowl
3) desi original chicken shawarma
All 3 of them i liked a lot, especially 1) and 3).
Me being a healthy food eating person, instructions of using less oil and less chilli were correctly taken into account by the restaurant and the taste also was great.
Quality and quantity were both quite satisfying. Great job.üëåüèªüëçüèª
One suggestion from my side will be to add calories, ingredients and nutritients information (for ex: protein, fat, carbs content; micro nutrients information) for each dish being offered. This will be very helpful for everyone especially for people like me who want to eat clean and healthy.",4,"2019-04-13 16:08:22",1,0,0

If no maple syrup is to be included in your combo please specify it but serving pancakes and waffles without syrup or anything else is simply not acceptable. This is the second time this has happened. ",1,"2019-02-09 19:13:36",2,30,0
"15962386","Located near DLF, IIIT - This small place is mostly for Swiggy orders. Interior is simple and cosy. We had combo deals booked through Dineout. We were supposed to have pizza squares but they had run out of it. So they offered another shawarma instead. Shawarma and nuggets were served first. After waiting for sometime we got the mint cooler and waffles.
Food is tasty and delicious. However service is bit slow.
Will recommend for online delivery from comfort of home. Combo deals are really easy on pocket. ",4,"2019-02-08 10:55:39",74,210,1
"52508065","We dropped at this place on Sunday morning for breakfast. It's a small cafe with quirky posters and phases on the wall which will definitely catch your attention.
Coming to food, we ordered two combos : shawarma + Nutella waffle + citrus mint cooler and best of both worlds. We also tried spiced bell pepper omelette which was really good. Other items were average, nothing great. Quantity of the food was good.

"1777677","First Impressions: Not a place for breakfast for sure. They aren't ready for dine in customers.
Tells you blatantly that your order will take time (more than 40 mins before I placed the order). I checked in at 8 40 am!
Ambience is a great miss for sure. Super duper uncomfortable seats.
Add:
The pancakes are very average. Could be more fluffy.
They did not have waffles, so i can't tell.
Eggs: shambles not scrambled. Over salty in places. No salt in rest of the place. Why are you charging so much if you can mess up eggs.
Tea: the only reason I beimg kind and can say 2.5 is tea. Lovely tea. Quite a hassle btw for just tea though üòÇ",2,"2019-01-20 08:41:28",18,146,1
"41982703","I had ordered 2 varieties of shawarma. The order reached on time. The packaging was good and the Shawarmas itself were hot, creamy and delicious. It was wrapped in foil paper and quantity was sufficient wrt price. I used the 50%off coupon from Zomato. I recommend this place.

What a treat it was to look at the packaging taste and everything was so good.I am quitd impressed by their service. They need to work on just one thing.

"38735838","Just ordered special desi chicken shawarma from this place and was the worst shawarma i had lately, very very less chicken filling and dull flavour. Not at all worth the price.",1,"2018-12-22 01:13:19",3,1,0
"55689816","A good place to have value for money food , the staff is quick to respond and polite , what I didn't like was the hygiene as some kind of foul smell was in the restaurant also the lights are not up to the mark which needs to be improved and the temperature inside was kind of hot even in winter.
When it comes to food it is very good with good cost and tasty , we had desi shawarma , Peri Peri and chilli garlic shawarma regular size , all of them were really tasty , their other options are also a must try.",4,"2018-12-10 02:02:09",42,68,0

"34009097","I aplogize for posting the review so late (after a year or so) but yes, the memories are still fresh in my mind. I must say that this one is actually very special to me.
This is the first place I came with my best friend. He forced me to come out of my room and asked me to decide about the food. Shawarmas. That was it. I saw that I could try the vegetarian version here, so I was happy.
We had our respective types of Shawarmas: he had chicken and I was more than joyous about having the vegetarian one. We got to listen to good music, hear the incessant chatterboxes talking out loud but we found silence in our own way and conversed about our ideas. It was good food, good company and a great experience. Just that, it can hurt your pocket a little! ",4,"2018-12-01 22:53:17",122,636,0

"29562497","This place is very common to the corporate people who work in DLF and its premises for its reasonable price and food with perfect quantity and quality .The only thing i would suggest everyone is do not opt takeaway/homedelivery for waffles because when hot waffles are made they are immediately stored in plastic boxes due to which hot air is released by the waffles and condenses in the box itself thus it becomes very soft and disgusting to eat .I have ordered Best of both worlds (Reg. Waffles,pancakes,scrambled eggs and cold coffee)and Veg iron monster(panneer biryani and coke) pancakes were yummy along with maple sauce,scrambled eggs were amazingly toasted without using much oil.panneer biryani was just ok a bit more flavoured.Cold coffee tasted like regular one.Packing quality needs to be improved.",4,"2018-10-07 23:31:38",87,320,6

"44237244","Delivery review
What I ordered - best of both worlds which is a combination of waffles and pancakes served with scrambled egg accompanied by choice of beverage which I choose tea
Price - 199 plus taxes.
Food review - the food was in general leaning towards healthy taste though it was not mentioned as such. The scrambled eggs were without any kind of spices and just tossed in butter. Pancake was nice and fluffy but the maple syrup was too less to enjoy it fully u can see the pics. Waffles tasted bland but may be coz it was just plain waffle and it was too hard thumbs down üëá. Tea was really nice and was warm enough and they provided a disposable cup which was quite cute. Special mention to the superb packaging and value for money which urged me to give an extra one star though the food was a 3 üåüüåüüåü for me. Over all if u r health conscious may be it's an absolute visit for u but for me 3 and half for now till next time. ",4,"2018-09-11 22:54:42",23,330,1

Talking about the taste, we ordered chicken shawarma combo and rice bowl combo. The taste of shawarma didn‚Äôt reach our expectations but the rice bowl combo was really good! Need to work on the shawarma cuz the taste levels of shawarma is pretty high! Regarding the service, the waiters were good & humble the service was good but faced an issue with the payment. Their swiping machine wasn‚Äôt working so i had to go for an ATM which irritated me.      Management has to look after these issues. Their ambience is good and clean! Spent some quality time.

"1057042","I had ordered out everytime. The packaging is excellent although the food is okayish. The shawarma is like having roti and malai chicken. The rumali roti is soft and the filling inside is moist. There was not punch of flavour but a monotony on the pallette. Also their waffles are okayish too.",3,"2018-07-02 07:47:43",104,398,0
