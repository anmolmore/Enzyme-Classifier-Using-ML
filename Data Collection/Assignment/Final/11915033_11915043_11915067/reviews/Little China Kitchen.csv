"27934303","Never tasted pizza so awful. Pathetic smell and I have to chewing it so hard. They took around 1hour to prepare. I called them to enquire regarding the order delay, they disconnected my call. I called the delivery guy and asked him to pass the cell to them and they said after 30minutes of placing the order that they need more 20mis to bake it. Expecting a delicious pizza after such a delay. But can't say how I felt after having a bite, they are the worst pizza outlet in Hyderabad. I give them zero(0) rating as Zomato doesn't have the option. Plz ignore this outlet as per my experience, otherwise your wish. ",1,"2019-04-21 15:17:09",5,62,0
