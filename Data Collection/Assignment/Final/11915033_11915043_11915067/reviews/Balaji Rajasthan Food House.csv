"54305133","Very very disappointed. I ordered one full meal in which Rajma, Paneer curry, Phulka, even the simplest Aloo curry was half cooked. Daal was watery as it could ever be. It was very easy to make out that Papad was cooked in a bad quality oil. Only edible properly cooked things in the whole meal were plain rice and raita üôÅ
Not worth having at all.",1,"2018-10-10 15:31:22",4,4,0
"43902984","Yesterday, I ordered aloo masala and plain khicdi as I was missing my home food and guess what I got, A COCKROACH in my food. We called them and complained about the issue but they were like it might be some fried onion.Seriously, a fried onion dont have legs and wings. They didn't even care.
Really not a good place. These people are playing with our health. ",1,"2018-09-22 12:29:02",4,4,0

"2537878","Delivery Review:
Ordered regular thali/meals and plain milk.
Food Quality : 2.5/5
The gravy/sabji were doused in a lot of oil. You could see a thick layer of red coloured oil over all of them. The vegetables were small in quantity compared to the wet gravy.
The plain milk was hot but had some kind of brown dust (or) substance floating in it (not talking about the cream/malai). It seemed they had used a dirty pan for heating the milk.
The rotis were usual sized phulka and regular white rice; no complaint there.
Food Quantity: 4/5
The meal included around 6 rotis (phulka), bowl of rice, buttermilk, 5 gravy/sabji (mostly wet), sides.
Food Packaging: 3/5
All gravies were packed in thin plastic covers and had oil dripping all over them. Use of aluminium foil covers for rotis and plain milk.",3,"2018-03-29 15:48:09",26,597,0

Food quality doesn't meet the standard and sometimes you might even get upset stomach or a heartburn after consuming their extra spicy food. Rice seems to be of cheap quality, may be they add some soda in it.
If you are ordering any customized dish like Aloo Paratha then make sure to inform them about your spice meter.
Also FYI..... For 100 bucks, you will get unlimited food but eat at your own risk :P",2.5,"2017-12-25 00:15:48",9,65,0
