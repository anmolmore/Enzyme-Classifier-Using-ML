"43354373","I really loved these momos (huge momo fan!). I ordered the Cheese Mushroom steamed momos and the Tandoori Chicken momos tossed in sauce. They were huge and delicious. I personally didn't like the sauce that much though . They can definitely improve it. Otherwise, the momos are yummmm!",4,"2018-10-28 23:04:23",24,283,1
"27009361","We ordered it at home. So went for veg momo, chicken cheese momo and tandoori momo. Veg momo was nice not too spicy but tandoori momo was burning hot. Couldn’t eat more than one piece. Might try might not try next time.  ",2,"2018-09-05 00:00:25",76,113,1

"6928631","If you are staying nearby in Gachibowli and have an sudden appetite for momos, you can visit this place and have your choice of momos from a wide variety. They serve it fast so if you are down on time and need a good healthy steamed Momo then it’s the best place to be if you are nearby. ",4,"2018-03-30 13:59:46",96,1335,0

"39787580","A small joint in Gachibowli . Most of the time they don't have everything available from the menu. 
The momos are usually soggy and broken up. 
Didn't have a good experience. 
Only the fried momos are good because of the crispy batter as the filling is not that good. ",2,"2018-02-18 15:05:28",64,112,0

And crispy batter fried mushroom and cheese momos. My all time favorite momos joint in Hyderabad.",5,"2018-02-15 21:43:54",12,174,0
"226632","The momos aren't great. I wouldn't recommend this place. For someone who understands momos, this would be a real disappointment. The biggest problem is that the chicken momos are not at all juicy and the Momo shell is also dried out.",1.5,"2018-01-16 23:51:55",36,175,0

"27970325","Ordered chicken steamed momos (dimsums) with meonise and the food was superb in taste. It's a small shop so can't review on the ambience part but the prompt response from the vendor in delivering the order can rate him good on service.

"33093114","Known for momos,
Tried steamed paneer momos and chicken tandoori momos.
Momos are ok but stuffing inside momos are less
and the chicken is not cooked properly.
Mayonnaise is priced extra.",2.5,"2017-08-17 07:10:59",439,1012,2
"1727590","Visited and even ordered online from this place quite a number of times. They have a good variety of momos but i like the classic chicken momos. They have good amount of filling, good size and served hot. Sauce on the side is better than most other places. Worth the money. ",3.5,"2017-04-08 22:18:24",155,363,0
"31742250","Tried their fried momo and thukpa.I am big fan of momo and I found fried momo to be very yummy,its full of chicken minced inside.I  am from kolkata I know how cheap is momo in kolkata and taste is that to awesome.",4,"2017-04-01 15:31:06",71,116,0
"35919085","behtareen Momos.
was just roaming around with a friend when felt nostalgic to see a momos joint. momos are always enjoyed on the street so lets not talk about location and comfort of even standing. 
special thing about these momos is the we have variety. we tried veg and spicy veg and then chicken.
chicken is always good. but spicy veg is great. reminds you of delhi momos.
recommended : spicy veg steamed momos.",4.5,"2017-02-23 18:19:27",18,508,0
"27894707","Being from the hills where momos are priced at 20 bucks for 10 good pieces that taste delicious, finding the same or similar quality & quantity is always a task for me. But because I cannot stop the craving that I get most often, I cannot help but try them around; that may be one day I would find something just as good momos around & that is something that I have failed to witness in Hyderanad.
So, I visited ZomoZ, not that this was the first outlet that I was trying at, I have tried them at various locations but I thought of giving this another try; may be it would be better! The momos that I ordered were over cooked that its outer covering was sticky and broken for a few pieces. Firstly, the covering also was way too thick & the momos seemed almost half filled. The chutney was nothing but mashed tomatoes and made my experience even worse. I have always heard responses that the people out here want sweeter chutneys, but thats not how the chutney of momos are supposed to be. Also, it should at least not be watery so that it sticks to the momos. 
They need huge huge improvement!
One good thing, the person that attends you! he is so genuine!",3,"2017-02-12 19:45:58",276,1753,0
"36116413","Very delicious momos first time I experienced here. Every thing is fine expect sitting availability. 
Location 3.5/5 ( parking is available for two wheelers , lil bit hard for 4 wheelers )
Taste 4/5 ( really delicious and tasty momos , definitely every one will like them.) 
Ambience 3/5 ( don't think of ambience because it's model like Frankie )
We had red spicy momos  and mushroom cheese momos. You can see pics of red spicy momos. What ever momos you order definitely they won't disappoint you.",3.5,"2017-02-09 20:52:59",34,41,1
"8784821","Momos are zomoz are good and worth giving it a try, the person at this particular outlet is very friendly and makes it more joyful to enjoy your momos.

"35800421","Momos here are really nice. Steamed Chicken tandoori momos are damn tasty. Veg momos are not so good but chicken momos are delicious. A pretty decent place for momos lovers .Will definitely visit again.",3.5,"2017-01-19 00:10:15",159,1098,0
"2162468","A decent place for momo fans! Although taste doesn't match up to authentic version, definitely can be tried for momos cravings. 
Liked chicken momos both steamed and fried. Veg is just okay! Paneer can be tried. Mushroom wasn't great. Slight improvement on the quality is needed!",3.5,"2016-11-13 22:52:30",96,1175,0
"197648","Probably the worst momos I ever had .Me and friends  Ordered chicken fried momos and veg momos eventhough the service time was quick the momos were blant and greesy . We were not able to finish even half of what was served to us. The only thing working for them in food is the Chutneys they serve with the momos . ",2.5,"2016-11-06 10:52:30",65,635,0
"32511898","Zomos.. Best place to have momos in Hyderabad.. have tried their steamed chicken momo, tandoori chicken, chicken cheese, mushroom cheese and loved them all. Vegetable momos were comparatively not as good. Have to try their fried momos",4,"2016-10-05 08:21:18",157,873,1
"16319284","ZOMOZ - Its always the 1st place I think of for a quick snack, all the momos that they serve are delicious and the best thing about is that it feels to be home made momo's, This weekend on the menu was Chicken Tandoori Momo's (Steamed) .
Will Visit again !",4,"2016-09-19 14:55:22",127,1660,1
"895038","There are some 10 varieties of momos available. I tried chicken steamed and fried.. the momos were very nice.. They serve 5 momos in a plate so the cost is also ok. ",4,"2016-09-10 07:52:46",400,2709,0
"7943351","Ridiculous filling of Cabbage & Cauliflower and nothing else in veg momos. Paneer momos are filled with raw paneer. Highly Disappointed. 
The fillings should have carrot, capsicum and beans, how can someone just have cabbage & cauliflower filling with maida flour.",1,"2016-06-03 18:24:38",116,158,0
"1435776","This place is right outside my house and I love to nip down to this shop and have a bunch of momos. I love their chicken momos. Their mushroom heese momos are awesome. A lot of momo places don't get the sauce right. This place does.
You should definitely try the chocolate momo. They are the major selling point of this place. It's fairly affordable as well.
Highly recommended.",5,"2015-09-23 20:56:11",33,187,0
"29635813","The best momos i hav tasted so far :)
