"4743521","The problem with midnight ordering is that the restaurants provide sub standard food at high prices. And this restaurant is not different.Order 2 shawarmas for myself at 2 o clock in the night and what came was a disaster of the highest order. It was overflowing with oil. The mayonnaise sauce had too much of mustard in it and it had been haphazardly rolled up.The quantity they serve doesn't even justify half the price.Â Really disappointed with the attitude of the midnight delivery restaurants.",1,"2019-02-18 18:16:14",207,1048,0
