"467656","You guys need to stop taking online orders if you don't have bandwidth to deliver. 3rd time I have order through uber eats and u keep the delivery guy waiting for an hour to hand him the order. Why do accept the order of you don't have enough time ??? Why do you think that it is ok to starve your customer for hours ??? Why do you keep shouting and ignoring the delivery guys ?? They are waiting and suffering our complaints because you accepted the order ,because you wanted to serve, then why this behaviour and why such disrespect for the customer... HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY.",1,"2019-04-06 22:01:46",3,0,0

"3093673","I don't know how in the world have I not reviewed this place! It's one of my favourite, in fact is my favourite place when I'm craving for those gui gyi desi ghee mein banne buttery aloo pyaaz ke paranthe. So guys, I have even tried their paneer ko sabji and bhindi and all. I'd give maybe a 3.5/5 to the paneer. Bhindi was pretty good. But paranthas are what they specialize in. So if you're in Gachibowli, do try out this place, it's a small outlet, but has around 8-10 tables towards the inside, near DLF, right next to Triptify.
Also try our their special khoya lassi.
And if possible go empty stomach or when you're starving cause dude, no matter how full you go, the food is very heavy and delicious.

A rare pure vegetarian restaurant in Hyderabad that actually serves delicious food.
Parathas are served the way they must be, richly stuffed n topped with butter.
Chole bhature, aloo mutter and paneer mutter are a must try!!!
Limited rice options but they all taste amazing.
The only inconvenience face is the time taken to serve food. Like, it can take really long, so not a place to expect immediate food. But, IMO, it is worth the wait.",5,"2018-11-28 15:36:38",7,4,0

"27262822","One of my favorite places to have the best Punjabi food available in Hyderabad. Be it the baingan ka bhartha or paneer butter masala people are gonna love it. Apart from these paranthas with hari chutney is a perfect treat for your taste buds. 
Suggest you to have lassi once you are done with the food, one would love it!! 
Only concern here is the service time,  this place is crowded during dinner time due to the DLF office peeps but it's worth waiting. ",4.5,"2017-10-16 02:52:21",14,2,0
"2810826","One of the best places to have food around DLF. Quite a decent economic place for a good food.
Have to try their Paneer Curries or Parathas for sure.¬†
It would be great if they start serving on weekends too. Being a foodie I really love that they offer real value for food.",4,"2017-10-14 16:29:45",2,1,0
"31288688","Best Punjabi food. Pocket friendly. Parathas are huge and tasty af. The Dal Tadka here is THE DAL TADKA, a must-have in my opinion. Service is not that great and the sitting area is not so great. Longer wait time but the food is worth the wait.",3.5,"2017-10-08 15:36:40",109,1210,0
"573092","DLF is one of the best places in the area to enjoy street food. It gives you the look and feel of having street food and one of the best places to offer you those dhaba type feels is Punjabi bytes. They have delicious parathas and their Amritsari Kulfi is out of the world amazing. Everything on their menu is work going for. You have all the time to keep coming back and try everything they serve! ",4,"2017-10-07 08:19:39",115,700,5
"31888473","Hot and delicious food. Quick service and very pocket friendly. The quantity is good as well, for a quick meal . The place is small and gets crowded very quickly so go early for a seat and to enjoy your food at peace. The rasmalai wasn't great but the parantha's are yummy. Best place to go if your at work and need lunch and and if you're craving for some Punjabi food. ",5,"2017-09-28 14:06:10",4,0,0

"11880381","Dropped by this Dhaba of sorts after a strong recommendation from a colleague at work. 
First thing right off the bat, it was amazing to see the dedication of the sardar Ji working there , seeing him I couldn't control myself and automatically my Punjabi just came out, I think he too got a start for a second. 
Coming to the main stars, I ordered a Shahi Paneer and a dal Makhani to go. 
Service was prompt and waiting time was minimal, and thanfkfully onions were abundant ! 
The quantity was good too, but honestly the taste itself was not at all good, the paneer was definitely the worse of the too, with some weird khatta flavours, and the dal was just about palatable, which In turns leads me to believe that this joint is more of a dine-in kind of place where because the look of the food I had and what was served to those dining in was extremely different, no layer of dhaniya (Coriander) or butter was there in my food, and I think these small things can make a world of a difference. 
But can't necessarily complain since it was a tale away, and with take aways presentation is hardly the USP. 
I would certainly eat here again but this time surely dine-in , Though certainly wouldn't order the Shahi paneer again, and wouldn't advise you to either. 
Would probably gorge on the paranthas after a night of binging.
May the spoons be with you foodies.",3,"2017-08-25 00:12:15",116,932,1
