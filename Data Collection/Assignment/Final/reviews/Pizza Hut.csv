"29027266","Tried most of their pizza's and sides. One of our go to place for office pizza parties . They do offer good deals on Wednesday. Overall taste was ok. Can be improved in terms of cheese and toppings. ",3,"2019-05-18 18:33:52",42,615,9
"38069551","They never have magic plan pizza. Consistently I have seen that. Staff members are rude while talking. The moment I entered they said he will want a pan piza n started laughing. Shame on u guys",1,"2019-05-03 20:05:34",2,3,0
"68350022","The ambience is quiet good,I would rate that as 3.5 out of 5. Even the service was good but I was disappointed with the quality of pizza that was served. I ordered a "" Tandoori pizza"" (Medium ),where the kababs were not stuffed completely, extra cheese was not there. I would rate the food as 2.5 out of 5 .
Even the cleaning of the tables was not there . ",2,"2019-03-11 15:09:41",6,0,0

"35728378","Very bad and unprofessional service.. ordered pizza, but no response even after two hours.. when contacted them, they are giving irrelevant excuses like if ordered from zomato, they can't track it by any way..",1,"2019-01-26 21:38:20",3,2,0
"27934303","I have never seen such a pathetic pizza delivering outlet. I ordered in Zomato and waited for more than 90mins and still the status was order is in the kitchen. Can't say what they were trying with the pizza as if they were putting some gold in it. They are not using Zomato delivery also, so you have to contact directly with the outlet. Luckily for them the contact number was not working, so they were safe. Never ever go for Pizzahut, Gachibowli is the worst one in customer service.",1,"2019-01-13 22:42:30",5,62,0
"33076791","I ordered pizza from Pizza hut and these turdbuckets told me after 40 minutes that they are cancelling my order because they dont deliver to an area 100 m away from where they say they deliver to. Plus didnt even refund me",1,"2019-01-13 17:18:28",14,2,0
"50160196","I don't want to give single star but don't have an option to give ZERO stars. I have placed an order with Pizzahut online and the same is routed to Gachibowli store. The order is expected to be delivered by 8:15 PM and I have received a confirmation email saying that it gets delivered around 8:13 PM. I received a call at 8:22 PM from the Gachibowli store and they said they will be cancelling the order as they don't deliver to my address. They suggested I should place an order with Madhapur store. Unfortunately there is no way we can choose a store from which our order to be serviced. When I told the store manager that I want to complain he has given me the Pizzahut central team and have given me the number. I called the central team to complain on the same and after half an hour heated discussion they have routed my order to Madhapur store. My interaction with Pizzahut team resulted in an hour delay and have left my kids hungry. I want to caution my fellow Pizza hut lovers to be careful while placing an online order as the order may get cancelled. Especially if you are hungry then I suggest you AVOID Pizzahut and look out for safer options. The Gachibowli team is so insensitive and it is a waste of time talking toÂ  them.",1,"2018-12-22 21:27:46",1,1,0

"61433589","To start off, ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut only for it's brand. However, was disappointed with the outcome. My pizza was not fully cooked and it took a lot of time for them to make my order ( which was a normal veggie feast and not even anything fancy). So overall not a good experience, hopefully will order again and get a much good result. ",3,"2018-12-21 15:22:06",2,7,0
"33907635","The worst ever pizza restaurant I ever seen.
They take orders in bulk but fails to deliver any.

"193020","We visited this store on Friday 23-Nov with kids and the mosquitoes are flying around. The staff are not courteous enough asking for order and they are not asking to collect my food unless we keep asking for the food. They took almost 30 mins to prepare because the staff is doing chitchat with Swiggy delivery boys. The floor is wet and they do not care of cleaning it. Very bad service and staff",1,"2018-11-25 12:37:01",2,0,0
"45018320","Worst experience, for rs350 a pizza we just got 4 slices which are smaller than a normal bakery bread slice size and at least for that money taste is worst, really bad experience , ",1,"2018-11-01 22:26:58",3,2,0
"52169296","If the scale had lesser, I would have rated it lesser, with my own eyes I have seen them using something like mayonnaise in place of proper cheese,that's not what we expect.",1,"2018-10-28 12:45:58",108,241,0

"35623254","Pizza Hut has improved a lot. Frankly, it is better than dominos. Pan pizzas and big hand tossed pizza are really good. Base, toppings and cheese are all very good. But it really need to improve signature and supreme Pizza.",4,"2018-10-13 09:14:37",6,20,0
"27330757","Went here on Friday with the wife and bro. This was supposed to be an opportunity to start the weekend. We were immediately greeted with flies the moment we opened the door. We still stuck around as it was pretty late and we were all tired. We should have moved next door to domino's at that moment. It all started with the garlic bread and its tandoori flavoured dip which clearly was spoiled two days ago and it was still being served. It was changed thrice and I still got the same batch. Later, we ordered a Farmer's Pick pizza and we clearly mentioned that we did not want capsicum on one half. It was delivered with capsicum throughout. It was promptly replaced but, not only were we given again with the capsicum, this time they forgot to add the mushroom. When asked about it, they said that they don't have any and they forgot to mention it. By this time, it was already close to midnight and we were not only hungry but irritated as well. Their manager, by the name of chary and another by the name of prakash tried their best to convince us that this is the best and only service that we can get. Based on this horrible experience, it's safe to say that I lost all respect for pizza hut and this is a clear example of how bad their standards have fallen. Never eating at a pizza hut again.

"51197514","Rediculous, I never had such type of pizza in my life. Such a worst experience, taste less and 2-3 customers throwed it on dustbin at that time when I was sitting.such a worst outlet go for Kapil towers outlet or search for se other instead of this.",1,"2018-09-29 16:52:39",9,1,0
"39441735","I usually visit this place for pizza. Garlic breed and jalapeÃ±o poppers are so tasty. Recently when i visited i have one complaint these people they donâ€™t clean the tables as soon as one customer leaves from the table when asked to clean it took them so long to clean it. I have never seen such service from pizza hut. Food was good enjoyed our pizza.",3,"2018-09-23 23:27:53",22,19,1
"54007466","We ordered meal for two with stuffed crust. The pizza was prepared nicely and cheeze was spread till the ends. Garlic bread and potato pops were also good.",4,"2018-09-19 00:18:02",44,117,3

It made my dayðŸ˜‹",4,"2018-09-17 02:29:20",36,532,0
"910659","Well firstly, this is a take away restaurant predominantly. So the typical Pizza Hut ambience with nice cutleries and well setup dining space is unavailable, but it could be maintained well as it looked shabby. 
Secondly, the food standards are maintained well. Same taste and the staff are kind and gentle while taking and delivering the orders. ",4,"2018-09-16 20:49:06",7,12,0
"35322723","I tasted the worst pizza of my entire life at this outlet. The only thing good about this outlet is it's washroom that at least doesn't suck. I would have given it 0 rating but Zomato won't allow that. I simply paid 1500 bucks for a nice washroom experience and extremely sour cheese and hard as rock garlic bread.",1,"2018-09-02 19:09:18",1,1,0
