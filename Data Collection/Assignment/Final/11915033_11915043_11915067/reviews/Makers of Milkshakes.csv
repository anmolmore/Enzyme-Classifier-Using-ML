"33336845","The Irish Coffee Milkshake tasted very good. But, this eatery did not accept my order even after payment. One zomato valet had to go there in person to place the order manually. The valet informed me that there was no one at the counter when he arrived and later found one person busy on phone somewhere else. Very poor service, hence downrating.

"30940686","This signature milkshake outlet is now  at the biggest drive-in of hyderabad. Yes really its The biggest drive-in in at hyderabad which is just coming into limelight.
No matter why you go into a drive-in sure for a flow for long its mandate to order this shake. The taste and quality was just same as when you take a strong heavy sip at any of its 48 other outlets in the city. 
Had my favorite Ferrero Rocher shake. 
This drive-in has its beach volley ball and football court which is very huge. Best for a group of sporty friends to play and hage out with. There is live music this place during the weekends and if any events going on. Huge seating space which is air-conditioned is available at the top and also open space available. Separate party session for groups is available with very good party ambience. Contact the management for bookings. This place is open till mid-night 2 a.m and campfire kept during some weekends.",5,"2018-10-22 22:28:46",144,1087,4
