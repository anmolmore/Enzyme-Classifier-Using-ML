"33606923","I was searching for a good Veg place around Gachibowli to host my daughters 1st Bday and ended up with Lime. Dinesh was the manager and he made sure the menu and other arrangements are all taken care off. Over all i was happy with the way it went except for few points to caution. 
My personal fav foods - 
- Welcome drink - Pan shots
- Starters - Yum banana tikki
- Gravys - Malai kofta
- Noodles
- Mango dal
- Chats and Chocolate gulabjamun
What is good :
- Food is great in contrast to what we generally see in party places where the hall is free
- Staff is friendly
- Their roof top gives a different experience than a regular AC hall
Things to keep in mind :
- The Mic system caused issues which spoiled the party mood. They have good mic system, please make sure its in working condition and there is AV operator in stand by through out the party
- This place is strictly for a small group. Statis crowd should not exceed 60 - 65 pax. You can enjoy the place to fullest with 50-60 pax.
- Since it is roof top, summers can be pain ful even with coolers. There is always this tension of rain ;P
With the above exceptions, i loved the place. Their suite rooms are one of the best in the area at a reasonable price. Their ala carte menu also serves the best veg food in this part of the city.",4,"2019-04-11 21:22:03",1,56,0
"2432298","Really don't go with rating. We had here in the evening and trust me food was not at all good and coming to Service, they are damn slow. 90% items in the menu are unavailable. Only available items will be served 40mins later your order. Even people were very few when we visited here. Waste of money and time",1,"2019-04-08 17:41:53",34,40,0

"373014","I booked The Lime for catering for a private occasion for a gathering for around 80 guests. To start with they are very professional in getting the arrangements clear to customer and provide all necessary details about the services to be provided on event day. On event day they were sharp on time and had all things well set before guests started coming in. Starters and welcome drinks were floated to the guests nicely. The main course and desserts were also pretty delicious. Overall I was extremely impressed and satisfied with the services and highly recommend it for any events.",5,"2019-02-23 23:34:10",2,29,0

"42015520","I was at lime for buffet once. I was just really surprised to see the quality of food for the price they offered. It was amazing. That moment i decided to celebrate my son's first birthday in lime. Enquired with mr. Dinesh. Met him and decided the menu. He agreed for the changes i made. We ordered the cake too from them as i wanted a normal cake.
The birthday party was a huge hit with guests raving about the food. The starters were yummiest amongst all. Baby corn chilli garlic is the best. Bajjis were very hot and good. The highlight of the day was SIGNATURE drink from the lime. It was lemonade kind. Guests were
enjoying it alot.
We wanted no onion no garlic items in t
the menu. Dal was very tasty without onions and garlic. Elders were surprised to see that in a restaurant they could get it.
One of my relatives commented that he ate such great spread after 10 years in a restaurant.
What else does a host need?
I strongly recommend lime for those who want great vegetarian food at best price. Mr sohail was available during the party and made sure every item was available till the end.
Thanks so much squeeze SQUEEZE AT THE LIME ",5,"2019-01-30 00:39:15",1,1,0
"37383383","One among the good pure vegetarian restaurants, ambiance is average.
Food is good quality wise. However, I have been there multiple times and have observed a deterioration in the service. Earlier they used to being finger bowl on the table, sauf in the end , even have sometimes offered some complimentary chocolates for trial. Now, despite of asking multiple times for finger bowl, they didn't gave a damn about it.",4,"2019-01-29 19:40:53",20,17,0

The service was good and there was issue even when our guest count was more than what we estimated. We have chosen Squeeze @ The Lime for our Kid's B'Day party as we found it very good when we attended few parties at roof top banquet. It is the best place if you are planning to have a party with around 90-100 guests. I look forward for another event with Squeeze @ The Lime.",4,"2018-11-29 18:54:33",1,1,1

"43253672","The quality of the food is bad. The noodles, starter and the sweet, everything was drenched in heavy oil. The taste itself shows that the oil used is also of low quality.

I visited this place for about 6 times with family, friends & colleagues (reunions).  Every time I happened to have a variety to taste....especially the SOUP and the platter is colourful.....the STARTERS. In fact to be precise.....like the ""Death by Chocolate"" in icecreams, their specialty is ""Death by Starters"".....they are just enough for your craving muscles & blends of buds. 
The hospitality is a near very good and courtesy is the topping on the ice.  My 3 cheers and 5 thumbs for this place.

"2250560","Simply the best place in town for hosting a party specially if you are looking for a pure vegetarian authentic north Indian food. I hosted a lunch party for about 40 adults and 15 kids today and what a memorable experience we had!! It was an important personal occasion for me and I wanted it to be a memory for lifetime and Lime staff (specially the manager, Dinesh) made sure that it happens just that way!. Food was excellent. Starters were plenty and each one of them was outclassing the other one in taste. My guest just kept asking for more and more and Lime staff kept serving them without any fuss!. I just loved their Ajwaini Paneer tikka, corn Manchurian and cottage cheese pizza. Pain puri and dahi puri were good too. And yes, the delicious manchow soup that we opted instead of tomato soup they offered by default. Main course was also matching with the high expectations that starters set. All curries were great in taste, rotis and naan were served hot and whenever one wants. Rice item were also good (didn't try one myself but as told by my guests). They served Jalebi with rabadi and chocolate gulabjamoon as desserts and everyone just loved them.
Would also like to specially mention the courtesy and hospitality shown by each and every member of their serving staff. They were actually requesting my guests to taste everything and were treating my guests and their own! What more I could have asked for. At the end special thanks to Lime manager Dinesh who made sure that we have the experience that we had. I would strongly recommend this place if you want a memory for a very long time.",5,"2018-09-09 22:13:36",1,1,0

Be any cuisine, they do justice to it. Whether it's Chinese, Indian or Italian, everything tastes good. It's a must visit for a Vegetarian food lover.
Must try are Soups and Chinese Starters.

"46890022","Must read - I went to this place with my friends for buffet lunch. We had two options for welcome drink - one is pineapple and other is grape which were not natural fruit juices they tasted as preservatives, then moving on to soup - manchow soup was good, waiter forget to give us the starter. Served us after we reminding him, we liked crispy baby corn among 3 varieties of starters which he took 10 mints to serve for the second serve when only 10% of the place was occupied. When I asked him mayo dip waiter was giving us the left over part of dip on the table beside. When I asked for chilled water they were saying they don't have, later one of my friend asked the same person he gave us chilled water. All the items which were placed at buffet were cold not even Luke warm. Biryani was totally dried out rice was sticking to the vessel had lot more bad experience here on same day",1,"2018-04-30 04:18:17",3,1,0
