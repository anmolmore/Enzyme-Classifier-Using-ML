"108895326","Hello Hyderabad..!!!!!My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the  awesome food court around Hitech City and Gachibowli. it is  located near the DLF signals and beside Creamstone Gachibowli above Thick Shakes. 
The ambiance is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design with array spans of Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits
Red hot roasted Chicken Wings  ❤️ - Juicy chicken wings are coated and fried along with Mexican                                                                   Jerk Suces Yummy unforgettable. 
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Drum Stick Dum Biryani-OMG very different as i never experienced trust me  you guys will fall in love with it. 
Drum Sticks ❤️ - Nachos topped with red sauce and I JUST  loved it.  
Combos ❤️ - The true fact i have ever seen even in KFC, Mc-Donald's such awesome combi within a convincing budget. loved it. 
I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out all kinds biryanis so far The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mock-tails. Sluches chocolate flav is an absolute delight! Also a fan of coke float.
The staff is ever so courteous. Awesome place to hangout with friends it really fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!!!!!",5,"2019-05-18 16:25:23",1,1,0
"48257693","It's hard to find places which give delivery upto morning 4am. American Wild wings is one of them. It's just beside Creamstone, Gachibowli. They deliver chicken wings,salad,popcorn,fries,biriyani and Andhra style chicken from evening till morning . They have a decent seating arrangement too. For chicken wings, you got almost 10/12 sauces to choose upon. Among them my favorite are Texas BBQ and Mexican jerk. Also tried their strawberry mocktail which was refreshing. Their biriyani comes with drumsticks / wings. Tried the drumstick biriyani. Chicken were well spicy and well with Curry leaves ( Andhra style). Service,ambience and prices all were decent. Nothing fancy to be expected.
So if you are planning to have something beforig indulging urself in Creamstone visit here.atoneplaceonline.com",4,"2019-05-17 13:12:54",85,190,5
"38201383","American Wild Wings is an affordable version of B-dubs. Mainly focused on Wings, Fries and Burgers with a touch of Desi dishes as well.
I was there with my wife for dinner and we had a delightful time as we both love Chicken Wings. The various Sauces on offer is amazing. We tried Pattaya Thai, Texas BBQ, Mexican Jerk, Original Hot and Amazon Wild. I liked BBQ and Original Hot, both were exceptional. We then moved on to Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Fried Burger and Grilled Chicken Salad. Nuggets were amazing, crispy and soft while Burger and Salad were delicious as well.
We had this with a few soft drinks and mocktails, namely Lemonade and Mango. Both were pretty good but can be improved.
Service was great. We were very well taken care by Mr Srinivas, the branch manager. Ambience is okay and needs to be worked upon a bit being an upcoming fast-food joint.
Overall, an excellent place for Chicken Wing lovers and that too at a moderate price range.",5,"2019-05-15 15:34:37",129,599,9
"43309790","I absolutely love chicken wings so I had to try this new place in Gachibowli as I’ve heard about it from a few friends.
I’ve been to this place with a group of foodie friends.
This is a small outlet located on the first floor ,right above dirty burgers.
The place can host upto 30 pax max.
The place was bright and colourful with good lights all over the place.
Food:
We tried different sauces:
The Texas bbq ,spicy garlic ,Pattaya Thai ,original hot ,Mexican jerk and Amazon wild.
All of the wings were delicious and had varying spiciness.
The wings were slightly crispy outside and soft inside,just the way I like them to be.
Next we were served with chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn.
The best munching dish I love till date are the chicken nuggets.
They tasted really good and were tastier than expected.
The nuggets were my favourite.
The chicken popcorn was not that great.
The presentation was not at all good and the chicken was very chewy.
Need to improve this.
Surprisingly the menu had biryani in it.
We tried their wings dim biryani .
The biryani was not that proper Hyderabadi biryani but had a good taste .
They served a really good quantity of biryani.
The management has to improve in their food presentations.
I personally liked this place and recommend everyone to do give it a try.",4,"2019-05-15 11:11:10",58,595,25
"43495179","American Wild Wings = Amazing Wings
I happened to visit this place yesterday for dinner. Well who doesn't like chicken wings? I love wings so wanted to check out this place.
It's a small cozy place, giving cafe feels. Interiors are decent and so is the seating. There aren't any sections as the place is streched longitudinaly. They have self service system.
Coming to food and menu,
The menu looks quite economical with respect to the portion size of the food and taste. So it is value for money. The only thing which needs improvement is the presentation of the dishes.
Taste, quantity and price are all up to the mark.
I tried their signature sauces for the mains, texas bbq, Pattaya thai, spicy garlic, original hot, Mexican jerk and Amazon wild. To my surprise all the wings were delicious specially the bbq and original hot, loved them.
Tried out the chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken... Among which nuggets were really good but chicken popcorn needs some improvement.
The menu seems interesting as they also serve biryani, not the authentic one but related to their respective genre, like wings dum biryani and drumsticks dum biryani. The quantity of chicken in the biryani was heavy and it tasted good too. Also had the chef special gongura chicken which was not on the menu. It was the star of the evening though, tatse, texture everything was perfect.
Also had a ceaser salad which required more dressing and flavour. Had fried chicken burger too, which was tasty and ya tastier than the KFC burger.
Overall the place is affordable and nice. The hospitality was very nice. Thanks Mr. Srinivas, you were always up your feet and served us well. The staff is humble and friendly.

"62886127","A great hangout place for the IT employees and with with really reasonable prices.
Peaceful ambience with no much of chaos in the place.
Order was taken as per our wishlist and made the items accordingly with the required spicyness and etc.
We had chicken fry , chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn and then boneless chicken biryani which were served really very hot and tasty.
Overall a very comfortable place with affordable prices and quality food.
Would surely drop by sometime whenever possible :)",5,"2019-05-14 22:29:09",1,1,0
"69306757","American Wild Wings is a very affordable place which serves quality wings. Located in Gachibowli main road, just beside creamstone, it is a place to relish Chicken Wings.
I tried out their Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Salad, Chicken Fried Burger and Various Chicken Wings. The sauce I loved the most was BBQ Chicken Wings. Chicken Nuggets were amazing as well.
We tried their Lemonade and Mango Mojito, they were okay but can be improved. The service by Mr Srinivas is quick and he is very understanding. Ambience needs a bit of touch up here and there especially at the entrance.
This place is a must try for their Wings and Nuggets. ",5,"2019-05-14 20:48:29",3,1,7

Visited this place on a Friday evening. The interiors are okayish, they need to work alot upon that.
Now coming to food:
We tried their wings in 8-9 different sauces. Most of them were really good and the chicken was fresh and meat fell off the bone.
My personal favorite was Mexican jerk, Barbeque and Konaseema. Though the sauces can be reduced a little.
Also the lemon garlic and original hot need to be improved. The lemon garlic had so much oil in it and the original hot tasted nothing but red chilli powder.
We also ordered Virgin Mojito which was very very sweet for our palate.
The Chicken Caesar salad was a big disappointment as it was full of lettuce and sauces. The chicken was very chewy.
We also ordered Chicken Biryani and Patiala Chicken.
The biryani was good but had a lot of oil in it. Meat was fresh and tender.
Patiala Chicken had good flavors but alot of masala in it.
Also the Chicken Popcorn can be completely avoided as the chicken is very rubbery and needs alot of improvement.
The white sauce pasta again was very sweet for our liking.
Overall this place needs alot of improvement but you can definitely try out their wings as they are good and economically priced.",4,"2019-05-14 14:12:33",84,367,22
"1700577","American Wild Wings is another fast food joint located amidst the Cream Stone outlet of Gachibowli. The place is open and has an ideal sitting space for 20-30 people. Went there with my friends to try out their food. I found their Ambiance quite ordinary and I felt it can get some makeover.
Starting with their appetizers, We first tried out their in house Chicken wings. So, the chicken wings served over here are classified into various types. They offer a wide range of sauces for their wings ranging from classic Texas BBQ, Pattaya Thai, Spicy Garlic, Amazon wild etc.
My personal favorite of the lot had to be Original hot Chicken wings and Mexican wild Chicken wings. The wings were super juicy and delicious. However, I also feel that the sauce content was too much for the wings which can be slightly reduced in order to make it taste perfect.
Next up, we had their Classic Chicken Nuggets and Popcorn Chicken. The nuggets were super tasty and very much similar to what we usually get to eat at all fast food outlets. The Popcorn chicken was chewy. It requires serious attention and changes.
For mains, the place has also introduced authentic Indian dishes such as Chicken Biryani with Salan, Raita and Gongura Chicken. The Gongura Chicken was an absolute relish. To my surprise, the meat fell of the bone quite nicely and it worked really nicely with the clean flavors of the Biryani.
Thanks for a wonderful time Mr. Srinivas. Moreover, this place is comparatively quite pocket friendly and can be given a shot for their Chicken Wings anyday. Happy eating, :)",4,"2019-05-14 11:39:46",275,1978,7
"2452778","They say ""count your chicken before they hatch"" and this weekend I did almost that. Hehehe, well, we were counting them before having it 😆🍗😉.
Our visit was an invite for a complimentary lunch by Mr. Srinivas Lanka incharge of the restaurant operations, management and marketing. This place on a main location of Gachibowli, Hyderabad with a dine-in. They offer American Cuisine for 🐔🐓🍗 chicken lovers and as the name suggests they specialise in Chicken Wings.
We got some thirst-quenching mojito mocktails- lemonade, orange and strawberry. They also offer slushies but was not available at that time. Moving on as suggested we ordered the wings with 4 kinds of sauces- Pattaya Thai, Spicy Garlic, Texas BBQ and Mexican Jerk (👈 this one was my favourite). They were slightly crispy on outside and juicy on the inside.
Pattaya Thai- spicy sauce with coarse texture
Spicy Garlic- Finely chopped garlic and chilli flakes sauce
Texas BBQ- the same old barbecue sauce with sweet and savoury taste and a hit of chilli. 
Mexican Jerk- a sweet and spicy smooth textured sauce that won my 💓.  
We also ordered for Popcorn Chicken which was crispy fried but not very impressive, Original Patty burger which was quite simple (no veggies in it, not even the basic ones like- tomato, onion rings or lettuce) and was served pretty hot with French fries so be careful when you take a bite. We also ordered for Asian (fried) Chicken Salad but was served with Caesar Chicken salad 🥗, which was little disappointing to taste as well.
You can definitely visit this place on Fridays and Saturdays for drinks (liquor) as well. So here is my rating on this-  
Food- 4/5 (this is just for the chicken wings alone)
Service- 3.5/5 (little slow but courteous staff)
Ambience- 3/5 (nice and decent)
Overall I would like to rate it 3.8/5 as there is lot of scope for improvement in future.

"48499440","We happened to visit American Wild Wings on a Friday evening and the place was desolated. The place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept.
We started with a lemon mojito. Though refreshing, it was a tad too sweet for my liking. We thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately, our Chicken Ceasar salad was drenched in dressing. It almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise.
Then came in an array of wings, each with their own signature sauces. We tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them. All the wings were fried well and had a good crunch. Of all the sauces, my top picks were there barbeque, konaseema amd mexican jerk. Barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio, the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper, coriander and coconut, and the Mexican jerk had a garlicky peri-peri kind of flavor. Must try sauces! While these sauces were good, few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing. The lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate. The original hot didn't taste of anything but spice and bitterness. They also have a sauce names Atomic - the hottest on their menu. It was indeed very hot for my liking. We also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent. Chicken nuggets were good. Nothing out of the ordinary.
Though their USP is wings, they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving Biryanis, fried rice and a few curries. We tried their chicken fry-piece biryani and it had a unique flavor. The meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt, but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well. Chicken Punjabi, a sarson ka saag version was actually really good. It had the perfect saag flavor. Again, too oily.
Upon their suggestion, we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn, both of which were terrible. The pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard. Stay away!
Another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes. The first serving of our wings was dead cold. When brought to their notice, the second serving was mouth-burning hot. The biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl. The bowl was so hot, we couldn't even pick it to put the food in our plates.
Overall, they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve. The quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes, serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon. They also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds. Price wise, they are pretty pocket friendly!

"37381843","I was invited by Mr. Srinivas, the man in charge at AWW for a tasting lunch session, the food was complimentary from their side. I had a nice afternoon there. The restaurant is very well placed in Gachibowli, just near Karachi Bakery on Old Mumbai Highway. 
The best part of the experience (beside the wonderful time spent with Mr. Srinivas) was the food. I tasted their chicken nuggets, caesar salad, different types of chicken wings and I took a parcel of grilled chicken burger with fries.
- I really encourage everyone to try their wings! I had texas bbq sauce, parmesan and garlic, mexican and lemon pepper sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed every style. The wings were juicy and tender, yammm.
- Caesar salad was very nicely dressed, nice chunks of chicken there and the croutons made the dish complete.
- The burger was definitely above the average burgers you have in the city. The burger patty was a real burger patty not some sweet bun.
- Nuggets were regular, deep fried with mayo, nothing special here, just a decent starter.
More of that, I checked their menu and the prices are really reasonable!
Aside the good food, there is some room for improvement. The place should be better maintained. At the entrance door there was a bit of mess and the cleanliness is not their strongest point. The order and cash counter side looks more like a storage area with boxes and bags over there. The tables, floors and windows should be spotless because this restaurant really has potential! And also I would suggest to have a better quality cutlery because the plastic fork given was horrible, it bended every each time I tried to pick some food. If they will focus a bit more on maintenance and details it can be a busy place because definitely the food is good.
Overall a reasonable priced restaurant with good food and some room for improvement in the ambiance area. But definitely recommended for a least a try!

I ordered Chicken Burger + Fries + Wings + Soft drink combo through Zomato, and received my order fairly quickly. However,
(1) Fries were totally cold and soggy. 
(2) Burger was average - tasted like the low-end 40 rupees burger at McDonalds.
(3) Wings were either burnt or double-fried. There were parts of the thick coating which were burnt black - and they perhaps tried to fix it by adding too much sauce on the top.
Looking at other reviews it feels like it might be once-in-a-while exception but they ruined my Monday Lunch!

Well, I opted for signature wings combo. Indeed it was fresh and mouth watering recipe.

"72130564","Ordered Chicken and Rice Combo. The packing was horrible. A portion of the Coke dripped into the packet leading to make the whole thing sticky. Even the tissue papers were smeared with Coke. The rice tasted sour. The drumstick smelt foul. The only thing met expectations was the Fries. May be for the first time in my life, I had to throw away half of my food. Would to look forward for the betterment of the quality and taste.",2,"2018-11-15 16:34:53",8,8,2

"33167664","I'd rate it 2.5 I ordered 'the original patty burger' and wings. The burger was quite average or maybe even on the lower side. The buns felt dry. The patty wasn't anything special. The fries that came with it were too salty. The wings, however, were tasty[4/5].",3,"2018-10-27 17:12:25",15,51,0

The menu is really good and pocket friendly. It gives you a variety of options.
We tried the chicken original patty burger, chicken wings in bbq sauce, fried chicken burger, chicken wings, French fries, curly fries and coke. The quantity and quality are both worth the money
Loved the curly fries. They were crispy and very tasty. Must try!",4,"2018-10-17 14:42:48",77,305,4

"31676376","I ordered the signature chicken wings through zomato, which is 1xfrench fries, 6x chicken wings, and one coke(350ml).
Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.
I would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself. ",4,"2018-10-08 14:03:29",11,1,0
