"50309081","Ambience is based somewhat related to Wild West. Barrel Tables like they have in Texas. Got a decent screen to watch matches. Music is not too much loud so you can hear what your friend/ colleague says. Food is good as well. Got a Pool table and mini Futsal table as well. ",4,"2019-05-18 22:02:58",2,8,4
"43582215","The English cafe ends where it starts. There is nothing English or Brit about it. Staff unfriendly and really donâ€™t care about service. Food is just about ok. ",1,"2019-05-10 15:25:28",6,3,0
"41879648","We had a drink there. Fries were really good and the ambience was really great. Pool table was also really great and we enjoyed trying some shots there. Service delays took a one star away from me.",4,"2019-05-05 20:34:12",43,88,0
"572861","An awesome place. Actually, we are regulars at komatose on weekends but due to a bulk booking the place was full, hence while driving back we chanced on the English cafe and decided to give it a try since its listed on Zomato gold. A sports bar with apt ambience, well stocked bar, comfortable seating. Good food, superb offers on drinks. The pinacolada cocktail was fresh, fruity and delicious. The quantity and quality of food is worthy of the price. We specially enjoyed the broccoli malai and veg Alfredo pasta. Our request for a saucy pasta was happily catered to. The staff is extremely helpful. Special call out to Ratnakar who serviced our table and ensured we had a lovely evening. Please do maintain the quality and service levels. Definitely going to frequent the English cafe, its worth it. ",5,"2019-05-04 23:46:27",3,2,0
"73492729","Excellent place to spend an evening with friends and loved ones. Very nice ambiance friendly staff and pocket friendly ðŸ˜Š Food options is limited but testy food indeed, specially the fish & chips and crispy corn. ",5,"2019-05-04 21:19:07",3,2,1
"33180314","This place can be easily located and there was no issue finding it. Special shout out to the two dishes we absolutely loved, Chicken Picatta steak (served with creamy mashed potatoes, veggies and mushroom sauce) and fish and chips (served with fries, salad and mayonnaise). Both the dishes were authentic and best part was both were moderately priced. I ordered one mocktail (blend of mango, chocolate sauce and mint) which, tasted decent but nothing great and one Kamikaze shooter. They offer +2 complementary drinks to ladies. The staff was courteous and so was the chef and the owner. We decided to appreciate the food which, they accepted very gratefully. To be honest, I didn't had much of an expectation but to my surprise it turned out to be great. ",5,"2019-05-04 16:58:36",6,46,1
"39588579","Very honestly speaking did not have very high expectations from this place but was glad that this place proved otherwise. Was in two minds while ordering fish and chips but I can safely say that this place makes very good fish and chips. Ordered beers and vodka; was rather disappointed to learn that they won't serve french fries which is a must with the drinks. The food is pretty good be it the potato cheese fries or chicken side dish. Very pocket friendly too",4,"2019-05-01 00:57:04",7,12,0
"36174068","Well the ambience is good...starters are very bad...good service from staff...drinks are okay....zomato gold is only applicable on cheap alcohol brands...Egg fried rice is very nice...not many options in food",2,"2019-04-30 17:45:58",10,5,4
"56832598","Overall a decent and pleasant place. Good range and variety of music from polite DJ . Snooker table is an added attraction. Vegetarian fare is limited.",5,"2019-04-29 21:12:51",1,0,0

"42399752","Ratnakar, our server was really great at helping us with the order and food and drinks. Free drinks for ladies on weekdays and amazing food though the menu is very limited at least for vegetarians. But it's a nice place to hang out..",5,"2019-04-24 22:52:37",5,1,0
"32994663","The service was not up the mark. The staff is rude and does not clearly communicate or honour the ongoing offers. Why do you guys have to run offers, if you don't want to fulfill them. ",2,"2019-04-21 14:23:57",8,2,0
"29567493","Ordered a couple of beers, fish & chips and onion rings. Fish was good but the onion rings were below average. Staff was courteous. Music was poor. I guess that's what happens when your security doubles up as the DJ. The fact that there was a large group of middle aged men dancing and whistling was a bummer. This is probably not the target segment for this place so the management should handle this tactfully. Overall: below average experience. I would not be going back anytime soon.

"36279697","A perfect combination of good food n soothing ambience. An ideal place to hang out with friends. The fish n chips in particular is highly recommended. The only suggestion is to increase the no of items in the food menu.A highly recommended place @",4,"2019-04-20 04:21:05",2,12,4
"7840001","We want to have a quick lunch and we narrowed it down to English Cafe as I heard good reviews about it. Once we stepped in and tasted the food, I realised the decision is correct. Food is really good and definitely worth a visit. Will visit again soon!!!",5,"2019-04-18 07:26:06",6,43,5
"16216326","Been there yesterday post checking out over Zomato. Food and service have been good but what struck our group was absolute dissimilarity between the images on Zomato page and actual place.
It is completely different place in ambience and structure. It does not have any resemblance with images. Images are far too good, place is not.",3,"2019-04-13 13:06:19",2,91,0
"33219460","One of the decent places. Ambience is pleasant. Had crispy onion rings, which was a best bite with drinks. Beside this, also had crispy corn which was crispy and yummy. Overall had a good fime and will visit again.
Service - 4/5
Food - 4/5
Ambience - 5/5. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š",4,"2019-04-12 21:22:47",10,1497,3

"773374","I gave 2 stars for two reasons 1) Ambience was good 2) Staff was courteous.
Food, the most important thing lacked quality. I ordered Veg.food, and it was not at all up to the mark. It lacked taste. I would request the owner to make sure they upgrade their food quality.",2,"2019-04-07 14:56:55",2,0,0
"29973853","Had that extra spice missing. Felt that they can improve on the range of items served. Very limited items to choose from particularly in the veg section",3,"2019-04-06 17:54:33",25,5,0
"29205968","Best service and ambience.  Served customised food on request even its not there on Menu.  Great place to hangout with friends especially in IPL season.. ",5,"2019-03-30 02:03:26",10,8,0
