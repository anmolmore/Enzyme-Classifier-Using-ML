"60097942","Ordered zinger doubles and hot and crispy chicken....taste was good....packaging was very good( I really liked the KFC sticker on the outside which made me assured food is not tampered with)....delivery by Zomato also on time....just hoping KFC would consider to bring out more option in grilled or baked chicken items so that food can be healthy.",5,"2019-05-18 20:52:09",8,0,0

Fast service, but inefficient. On multiple occasions they gave the wrong order. ",3,"2019-04-20 21:33:14",195,612,0
"41520741","I had bad experiences at this place multiple times. The management has no sense of customer experience. The people working there dont even respond to customers properly. While ordering, they don't check the inventory. We had to wait for 30 min for order to be served and even after that, there were some items missing. When asked how long it would take, they just responded vaguely. Iam not planning on visiting this place ever again.",1,"2019-04-18 23:12:56",3,6,0

"8169781","I have ordered from here using the Zomato app. The ordering was simple. They responded very fast and I had the food delivered within 30 minutes of the order. This was a happy experience. The burgers were very good and the chicken legs still warm and succulent. The rice with small chicken nuggets was also excellent though the quantity seems to be a little less.",4,"2019-04-07 16:18:58",61,1188,0

"47894683","Don't know what is going wrong with KFC as a brand , they are doing it wrong in every aspect! No proper management of customers on the counters, the food they are serving is not upto the mark as it used to be. I was a fan of KFC, but slowly I am loosing interest in going. I had a very bad experience. The coke they served was very sweet without any soda in it , I though I was having a sweet water. The chicken was not served hot. The quality of the rice they are providing is going down day by day!
Management please look into this, or else you will be loosing a lot of patrons. It's high time to think! ",1,"2019-03-27 09:21:59",74,97,0
"7114841","on March 20th 2019, I've ordered 3 8 piece Smoky Grilled, which is worth of 1,857 rupees through Zomato. Instead of getting three 3 8 piece order, i was only given 2 8 piece order and 1 Hot crispy. I've called the customer care and i was assured call back. But, they didnt. when i've approached Zomato, i was told that there is nothing that they can do about it. Here is the twist of the tale -   instead of refund or replacement, i was only given 150 ruppes zomato credits. I would really not recommend orders from this place, as the customer treatment is pathetic. Since this is a corporate order, i strongly recommend my Food committee not to order anything from KFC in bulk.",1,"2019-03-25 14:11:05",2,23,0
