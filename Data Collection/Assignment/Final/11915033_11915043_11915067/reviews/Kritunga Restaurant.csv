"86873240","The worst biryani i ever had in my life till date. I am sure kritunga biryani tastes good, hope this is zomato fault they have delivered me a local biryani instead kritunga, theres no kritunga cover when i got it, it was packed in a normal cover. The worst exp i had today ",1,"2019-05-17 18:19:17",2,0,0

"57863536","A complete and absolute disaster. The place where we sat was dirty. There were cracks on the walls. We ordered the food to be less spicy but I guess they cook how they want to cook. The AC was non-existent. It felt like we were sitting in a tandoor. The service was pretty slow.¬† If you bring food you bring the starters together and then you don't put a gap in between the starters and the main course. The taste was appalling, sub-par service, being in one of the prime locations. I have ordered a lot of times from Kritunga Madhapur and that one is very good. I think Kritunga Gachibowli has a long way to go before it becomes worth the money. Wish them the best",1,"2019-05-02 12:00:53",5,1,0

"53335571","Hi,
I have ordered king of kodi pulao, Never expect too much from the title of the food. It is the worst thing I have ever eaten on this planet. The chicken is undercooked, The rice is giving a weird smell. As it is not cooked today. I have ordered Paya as well. I don't know if it is fat or oil but it's too spicy and oily. This is not the adept quality of Kritunga because I have been eating in this cuisine for more than three years. It's getting worse every year.",1,"2019-04-29 21:17:05",1,1,0

"98315225","I‚Äôve been to other kritunga‚Äôs many times since 6 years and never was disappointed. Ragi sankati one of the benchmark dishes served by kritunga was bad and I‚Äôm hesitating to use the word worst. Pulavs weren‚Äôt good either keema pulao was below average and veg pulao wasn‚Äôt properly cooked. After receiving the order and started eating waiter says they ran out of soft drinks which we ordered. If kritunga really consider reading these reviews I would like to quote a statement ‚Äú kritunga you‚Äôre just selling your brand but not good food anymore‚Äù",1,"2019-03-03 00:15:01",1,0,0

"2319082","I had ordered food from Kritunga many times to my office and had visited this place once(Gachibowli). The ambience here is good and the staff was attentive. 
The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry, it was very delicious. I also tried gongura chicken it was fine. Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. Overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies. 
Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order, it would great if the food could be packed in boxes.",3,"2018-12-03 22:25:39",12,2,0

While going healthy and done with enough of biryanis it was time for Ragi muda. Ordered one ragi muda, the quantity was good, properly boiled and happy to satisfy me. Have gone with many orders from this place.
Also visited their restaurant in madhapur branch and must say am very happy with the service, food and ambiance.
They have given it a old town look. Butter and Tandoori naan were amazing with the butavankay curry thick and 3 pieces of brinjal in it. Little spicy but absolutely homely food is what i can say about this place.
Again Ragi muda is my all time favorite from here, no doubt the chutney served with it is deadly spicy. But again you ask for some more ghee or take another curry.",4,"2018-12-01 09:03:09",139,662,9
