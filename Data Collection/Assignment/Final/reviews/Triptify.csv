"35725017","This place might be good but it's the worst now. Ordered a Chicken Keema paratha and got some vegetarian paratha instead.
Not only was the order incorrect but it was burnt!
Zomato refused to help on the issue.",1,"2019-05-18 19:27:09",2,2,1
"44074078","A very nice option for Paranthas lovers with so many different options. The taste is quite good and I love that they provide option to customise each combo so that we can select any combination of Paranthas. The Packing is also really nice. Totally worth it to have 5 star :)",5,"2019-05-08 23:24:41",16,5,0

If you are craving for some home style paratas this is a really good place.",4,"2019-04-02 22:31:54",22,92,1
"44849554","Good ambience.. Great food.. Well I would say best Parathas out there in the area. Served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy. Comes in Great packaging if you order online. 15 to 20 mins is average cooking time. So less wait more taste and great value for money is all that you need. ",5,"2019-04-02 14:10:08",7,3,0

The packaging is just so good, you get pickle, chutney, curd and butter with the Parathas. 
I‚Äôve tried Paneer Tadka, Paneer, Aloo, Punjabi Aloo, Capsicum corn, Cheese capsicum, chilli cheese. 
The Paneer and Cheese options are really yum. The parathas are served hot and heavy. They‚Äôre quite filling as the stuffing is pretty amazing.

"34884988","This has become a favourite place to have parathas.. they serve an Excellent quality with ample quantity of food. Fully Paisa wasool place.
I ordered paneer and aloo paratha thinking that small paratha will be delivered. But what a pleasant surprise, two monster size of parathas of each flavour were delivered. Packing was perfect and it reached my home hot and fresh. Both the types of parathas were really crumptious. Even the green chutney they serve with this was awesome. Those who have complained about less stuffing inside paratha should definitely try this. For sure, You will not be disappointed. Undoubtedly, full marks to the food.

"32911989","One of the best places quite possibly the best in parathas. I hear 13 dhaba and parathas and more to be better in This area.i have tried them all and there is no other rather than this I will order. I am the biggest fan of alloo and gobi paratha and this restaurant would know I order every 2 or 3 Rd day the same usual deAl. Of both above parathas. They are delicious. Absolutely perfect.

"2290562","I had heard a lot about this place and their amazing paranthas so i decided to try myself. I had ordered the combo of punjabi aloo parantha and cheese corn parantha. I loved the food packaging. The chutney, dahi and pickles came is separate containers and the parantha were packed so well and were piping hot.
Coming over to the taste, I would say i loved it. The aloo parantha was excellent. The corn cheese parantha was good too but i couldn't find any cheese in that parantha. I guess i would never order corn and cheese parantha again. But I would love to try other paranthas by triptify and wpuld definitely recommend others to try this place!!",4,"2018-11-10 18:45:33",34,77,0

Full marks for packaging and the way they serve you 2 big fat aloo parathas ( just the way they should be) with pickles, butter, dhania chutney and curd. They actually kept the Punjabi paratha feel alive so thank you for doing total justice to the food you serve.
A small complaint would be adding more aloo and not make the dough too thick, but overall, it was wonderful. And just like a true Punjabi, I even burped thrice after having this meal. Paisa Vasool! ",5,"2018-09-06 13:42:36",115,700,0
