"1874218","Ordered veg falafel, it was good. I didn't expect this vegetarian food to be this good.
The taste wasn't bad but the salad and mayonnaise was put in too much quantity.
Also, there was NO KETCHUP PROVIDED with this.
The overall review would be good but in this price it could be a little better, I hope they would review the quality and make in better.
Overall rating - 3/5
Taste - 3.5/5
Quality - 3/5
Packing - 3/5",3,"2019-05-01 02:08:36",10,13,0

"100969821","Best Chicken Shawarma I have had with the perfect ratio of Mayo to chicken to sauce, the chicken is well spiced and perfectly cooked, but veg shawarma is only average. ",5,"2019-04-20 13:06:34",1,1,0

"16142730","I ordered paneer shawarma to try something new.
And it was pathetic.
Was very weirdly spicy. The paneer and mayo was not very fresh. The bread was burnt at the end.
Not ordering again. ",2,"2019-02-03 02:54:22",166,977,0

"36495441","Ordered special chicken shawarma from here through Swiggy. Loved the fact that they have late night delivery.
Thoroughly enjoyed the shawarma, very subtle flavour which was not overloaded with mayo unlike few other places. Will definitely order again. ",4,"2018-09-15 03:15:17",140,362,0
"32917034","Been eating here about an year and half now and have never been disappointing by either the food or the service provided. This place also delivers food on time and has always been a life saver.
The shawarma has been my dinner for quite a while now.",4.5,"2018-04-30 21:50:50",63,334,0
