"1853730","Located in the newly opened drive-in in Gachibowli. Dropped by for a late night meal..
Must say, the pulao was very delicious. Tried egg pulao - perfect spice levels and the right quantity for the money you pay..
Totally impressed with the taste here...
Suggestion - will taste even better when served hot! ",4,"2018-10-22 19:08:02",61,261,1
