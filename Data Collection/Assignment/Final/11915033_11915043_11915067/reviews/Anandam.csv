"44074078","Quality & Taste of the food is quite good. Have ordered Roti, Dal Tadka chatpati, Subz chatpata,Jeera rice and felt that I'm eating home made food. Having said that, I felt the prices of curries can be little reasonable and food can be served with salad.",4,"2019-05-06 22:34:29",16,5,0
"109287303","I've ordered Thali. I'm really not satisfied with the taste. Only the papad is good rest but that comes in very less quantity. Either order from other restaurants if you want to have a North Indian meal. Totally not worth the money.",1,"2019-04-28 17:14:25",1,0,1
"51561637","Great place for vegeterians. Good quality food with good packaging .Try jain thali and other customized thali from wide range of thali they have.also don't miss to try out paner Kadai,rajma, and dal makhani which tastes awesome
And for all the good food, taste and packaging credit goes to the kind and humble owner Mr Gautham",5,"2019-04-26 22:41:28",2,1,0

"47377852","Last Sunday evening i ordered hot pongal from here. I was so hungry at that time. I waited eagerly for my food. order was delivered and I opened very fastly. But by seeing it only I felt like I can throw this. Because it is not at all seems like a rice. They have given the last bottom of the rice when we cooked. It was sticky sticky. I think They poured water in the morning rice and mixed with dal just added some pepper and packed it. The taste and quality was worst. I can give 0/5 for this.",1,"2018-10-19 00:02:03",48,15,0
"76182884","We ordered regular and mango Lassi. Both of them are really bad. First of all both the Lassi's are very diluted. In the Mango Lassi, they added the Mango flavored essence so much that we can smell it.",1,"2018-10-14 22:09:57",2,0,0
"36899585","Its a big surprise that they claim they prepare good north indian food. They are worst. I ordered executive thali from Anandam. It was very bad. Paneer and dal makhani was prepared with execssive tomato/tamarind paste. Chapati was of pure maida. Curd was also sour in taste.Gulab jamun was good. Thali from this place is not preferrable.

"53320041","Ordered JainÂ food. The food contained human hair as a condiment. I guess hygiene is compromised by this restaurant. Even the containers were broken and food leaked into the cover.

"37864042","Ordered a jain thali from this place today for lunch.Â 
Phulka is worst, trust me you wouldn't wanna eat it.
daal tastes weird and spicy. daal makhani was eatable.
curry was spicy too but eatable. with few pieces of paneer in it.
Raita has red chilli in it too with salt which i cudn't eat too.
rice, gulab jamun and salad was good. :PÂ 
And price is double the price of a normal thali which is eatable. I ordered a gujrati thali from a gujrati mess yesterday for lunch for half the price and it turned out to be home made food. :)
Overall not a nice experience.",1,"2018-09-07 13:46:09",2,11,1
