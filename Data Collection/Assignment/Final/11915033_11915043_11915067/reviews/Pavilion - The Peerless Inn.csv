"90824224","The zomato page describes the breakfast to be a lavish assortment but it turns out to be cold and tasteless foods lying unattended. Ambience is decent to be at but food is a below average. Breaksfast buffet cost is more than that listed here. Staff is friendly and helpful in nature. Location is very accessible.
Overall, not a tasty beginning to weekend.",2,"2019-05-04 08:58:24",1,0,0
"39118650","It is a hotel restaurant. We went here for team meeting and then lunch. The buffet contained variety of veg and non veg dishes. Chicken tandoori was good and tasty. The chicken curry and fish curry which they had was also goood. From my vegetarian friends we got to know veg dishes which included crispy corn, cauliflower manchurian, crispy veg and the veg curries were above average. The best part was the pani poori and sweets. Though the gulabjamun which looked tempting was not the way it looked.
The buffet was quite affordable and good according to the rates. It's a good place for team gathering and meets. ",4,"2019-05-03 10:16:46",50,69,0

"2977466","My 100th review and is of a spl place. It's the hotel where I am currently staying in and will continue to do so for another couple of weeks. Been having my complimentary breakfast here daily and also had the buffet lunch & dinner some times.
The buffet spread is really diverse and always tasting nice. Never had any issue with the taste of the food nor the service of the staff here at the Peerless Inn.¬† The starters, main course items keep changing with one thing being constant which is the Hyderabadi Biriyani.¬†¬†
Have tried almost all of the items on the buffet and have to say that never been disappointed with it. It really fills you up nicely when you are about to hit the dessert section. Marimuthu & Bala from the staffs are really courteous and I had a good time interacting with them&¬† all of the other staffs too.

"15697596","We we're searching for buffet at reasonable price for a team outing and finalized on this one.
It's typically a hotel which has a restaurant in the ground floor. The Ambiance is regular and decent, nothing special.
Food is just about above average.
The buffet spread is limited given the budget.
But most of the items served we're nice and tasty.
About the spread:-
Starters were decent, a slight disappointment, because a Chinese chicken Starter with bones just puts me off.
Main course is good.
Deserts we're very average. Just regular stuff. Not even one off them was very good.
Service was good, we hardly had to wait, though the restaurant was barely occupied other than our table.
Price is very reasonable, we got it for 399/- Al.
Overall, not completely satisfied, nor disappointed.
If you are really tight on the budget, this is a good pick. Else you can give it a miss.",3,"2018-05-28 14:07:56",197,519,0
"2728952","Hello Foodies!!!
This Restaurant is hole-in-the-wall kind of place. Hard to find and not easy to locate. You would have driven past it many times but would have barely noticed it.
Having done a bit of research on Buffet options near Orion villas ended up at this place along with three of my colleagues.
Typical hotel with restaurant on ground floor was my first impression. Then after quickly zooming past the menu realized we are in for a good lunch. 
Now the realization time and we are still having a good time üòä
Coming to the starters it was OK and main course was OK too. Nothing really stood out, but it was not bad either.
Ambiance was OK and the filling up of buffet was good and there was no waiting time. 
The deserts were just a regular affair.
Visit this place if you need your buffet not to hit your pocket badly and have good food.
Here‚Äôs my verdict:
Ambiance: 3/5
Food: 3/5
Service: 3/5

"4502511","The place comes at a lunch spread for 350+taxes and provides quite a decent spread and coke/sprite as a complimentary welcome drink.
The food is sumptuous and I loved the Pani Puri concept best. The ambience can be worked upon and so can the interiors be changed. The food spread includes 3 starters veg and non veg each, pasta, chowmein, soup both Veg and non veg, 3 types of Raita, 4 kind of salads, cut fruits and quite a few dessert tastes. There might one or two dishes or more I could be missing but overall it is a great dine in. There is valet for parking.
The staff is courteous and quite accomodating. The rating is 3 only for the ambience of it. The food is lit but the place isn't. The decor and furniture is ordinary. Can visit once for a reasonably cheap lunch with good quality food. ",3,"2018-04-05 02:34:08",77,669,6
"35404442","Friend treated me here for her birthday as we were a quite in no. and she heard good reviews and also because she had a budget.
For the price which is 370 for each person they have quite a good spread.
We reached there on time and in the span of having our lunch, we saw 3 different office team lunch being held. So I guess it's quite popular.
They gave us a Complimentary Fizzy drink. Coming to the starters, they didn't have a lot to offer but everything they served was yum. Few starters but everything tasted good. Each starter impressed me. Chaat was delicious as well. Definitely surprised me there.
Moving on to main course, the spread they offer here is not very large but good enough. They have noodles, rice, pasta, gravies etc. Shoutout to the butter naan, one of the best naans I had.
Now coming to desserts (reason for my low rating), horrible horrible desserts, looked appetizing but tasted bitter. As soon as I had one bite of cake I had to spit it out. Left a stale taste in my mouth and ruined my lunch! Not one dessert tasted average, they all were spoilt. Trust me when I tell how against I am on wasting food but I couldn't help it this time. And all of my friends said the same. Don't be fooled by how they look.

Been there couple of times and loved every dish served. Place doesn't look crowded which is what I want to enjoy a pleasant evening. Staff courteous as ever and quick to serve.

"1546123","I visited this place with my friends on a slow Monday afternoon for their Lunch buffet as a farewell treat. We choose this place considering the budget we had in mind as we were quite in a number and thus was not expecting much but, we were gladly surprised by The Pavillion.
They had a considerably decent spread with:
1. A complementary orange fizz drink;
2. 2 veg ( Malai Tikki Kebab & Veg Spring Roll) &
2 Non-Veg starters (Ginger Chicken - was Good , Rosemary Chicken - A bit dry) ;
3. 1 Veg ( Tomato Soup with Croutons) & 1 Non-veg (Chicken Manchow with crispy fried noodles - Loved it);
4. 2 Veg Salad & 2 Non veg(Chicken and Egg white) salad options ;
5. Chaat counter with Paani Puri & Dahi papri chaat;
6. All these were followed by a number of main course dishes including A Fish gravy, A chicken palak gravy, bhindi fry, mixed Veg curry, dal, veg pulao, Chicken Biriyani, Veg Manchurian, Veg Noodles, Steamed Rice, Curd/Raita/ Assorted fryums.
We tasted a little bit of everything and all the dishes including the chaats tasted very well. It was fresh, well done, served hot and fulfilling.
We were pretty full with all that but their dessert section tempted us to push ourselves a bit more as you always have room for dessert and their Hot crispy Jalebi's was a stealer ! They also had 3 options of fruits, Cakes, Mousse, Creme brulee and Hot sevai kheer but i couldn't stop obsessing over the jalebis :D
The best part is all the great stuff mentioned above was for just Rs. 350 + taxes for 1 person. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good buffets under a budget !",4,"2018-03-19 18:42:45",44,213,6

"50160361","We were looking for a hotel for my son's religious ceremony function for some 75 odd guests. Having checked many hotels around kondapur we discovered this wonderful place, Peerless Inn. What really clinched the place for us was the attitude of their manager Mr. Rafi Mohd. He sat with us, took us through the whole planning process and even involved the chef Mr. Sanjay Sahu to give us a edition experience. The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, quite aesthetic & pleasing. The hotel restaurant was exceptional, not only because we enjoyed the variety of options but each was a classic in its own right.
The prices was also quite reasonable and competitive to the competition around but what was really good was that Rafi assures you to leave everything to him and in the end he ensured what is promised is delivered. He surprises you with small details (like he provided us a small platform for the artistes to perform in the crowd and also gave a kicker of a welcome drink). Chef sahu gave us 'haasil-e-mehfil' cheesecake and a 'wow' dahi bada.
Highly recommended!",5,"2018-01-21 17:44:03",1,1,0

The starters were limited and were served cold.

"45727223","I should use Prologue for this review cos it triggers the complete opinion ü§£
I've no idea about those who rated below 3 over this decent ambient restaurant. After dining here, I felt that:
""If you're hungry, food should be good enough to fill your hunger in all ways""
I'd say these people had quite good menu compared to others. Well, I went on a deal where ‚Çπ350/- plus GST for a Veg buffet.. (Guess, Non-Veg also the same)
Looking at the ambience, I cursed who rated so bad for this decent one.. (Remember this isn't a paid review or sort of) I had plenty of food.. If I list out it'd be like an essay written in childhood by every kiddo!!
But, still if you wanna see what are the recipes available.. just take a look over the snaps I got.. Damn good service man, I was overwhelmed with their courtesy üôè
If you are the one who calculates ‚Çπ350/- for a buffet is not good, c'mon if you are hungry and if you choose a la carte, what'll you get hardly?
Yes, they might have offered dal makhan curry, methi chaman, naan, jeera rice but that doesn't sum up to what you pay for ‚Çπ350/- (No idea how long this offer would be).. So rush now and have the feast ü§ó

I would have enjoyed my food thoroughly in a dhaba or a small cafe but the reason we went here was to have something better , experience fine dining, try something different. I was utterly disappointed with the food , cannot mention a single item which was worth the price, by the way never pay full price here for the buffet , always look in nearbuy or little cause its not at all worth it.

"37332707","I have been there twice and I must say this place needs good management. They need to look after the the ambience..  The restaurant is at the lobby level where you will find dirty rug and cheap quality artificial plants.. There are many other things which will make you feel as if you are sitting in a roadside hotel.  Coming to the food..  It is pathetic. Soups.. Starters... Main course all are at the same level.  The only saviour  was the paneer and rice.. Mutton was not cooked properly,  fish curry was completely mashed,  Biryani rice was overcooked  and dessert was not at all up to the mark and one item was old. Please stop serving the same dishes all the time.  One of the major problem of this place is unattended buffet. I saw two managers having food next to my table and the restaurant manager is least bothered to ask for your dining experience or to take feedback. You guys can make it a nice place by putting more effort... All the best",1,"2017-02-17 00:03:59",59,725,0
