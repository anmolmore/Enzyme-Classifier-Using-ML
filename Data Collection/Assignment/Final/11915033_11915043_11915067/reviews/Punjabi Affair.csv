"56966340","Really good food. Had their butter chicken, kadai paneer and lassi.
Their butter chicken was smooth, mildly spice and amazing. Their kadai chicken was spicy and flavourful.
Their lassi was the right amount of sweet.
All and all really good food and a must try.",5,"2019-04-26 08:21:08",20,36,0
"48696276","I went here with my friend to have dinner. Ordered the masala Papad which was nicely decorated with onions, tomatoes and chat masala. It tasted good.
Then we ordered our favorite the chicken patiala, butter roti as always. Chicken patiala is the best thing to have here.
Final touch we gave with our favorite Patiala Lassi.",4,"2019-04-25 23:26:11",48,67,0
"3095480","Punjabi Affair...... another awesome place to have punjabi foooood........
Food: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
The food is very very delicious. The typical taste of the punjabi food can be experienced here. The special Patyala lassi is a drink which you must try at this place.
Ambience: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
It's a small place but is very good. It's a perfect place for a family/friends get together for a lunch/dinner. I personally prefer dinner. The typical dhaba sitting(Cot) is available.
Service: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
The service was great. They were very good and well trained at their work.",4,"2019-04-21 11:09:35",44,117,9

"221486","First time so we ordered Murgh Dhuandhar in the starter which was very good. Then we ordered garlic naan & tawa roti with Murgh Patiyala which is a gravy main dish wrapped in omelette, which was ok because it had a bit of smell. Patiyala lassi was great too. The staff were mostly courteous & service was in time. Medium sized restaurant with Dhaba kind of ambience (half of the place had beds & chowki) if not for the bright lights up above.

"3205625","Food is ok, not as good as Kondapur branch. Service is slow, I felt staff strength is not enough to handle the capacity. I had to wait 20 mins between starters and main course. On top of the wait I got wrong order.",3,"2019-03-23 21:09:29",2,1,0
"72546600","I would like to give (10) negative rating, but Zomato is not providing such an option to rate..I went around 9:20pm and ordered veg sheek kabab and one american chopsy, up to 10pm they didn't serve the food and when we asked they told it still takes more time. Very worst service. Thankyou so much for treating customers in such a way. Felt Disappointed....",1,"2019-03-11 22:24:15",1,0,0
"14171481","One star because rating is mandatory else 0 star is what they deserve.this is the worst outlet of Punjabi affairs.
First we got fly in our salad, then the order took 45mins to come. And it was not busy at all. Then waiters were not interested to serve us, busy chatting within themselves. I have been to Kondapur Punjabi affairs many times, but this outlet is not matching their standards at all. ",1,"2019-03-05 11:09:25",32,143,0
