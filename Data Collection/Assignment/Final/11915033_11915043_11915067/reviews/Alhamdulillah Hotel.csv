Area for improvement - food packaging & price seems to be on higher side
Quality & Quantity both are good.
Thanks",5,"2019-04-29 07:35:06",2,2,0

Going for rice items is the best choice from this hotel",4,"2019-04-26 12:21:31",15,2,0
"1874218","Ordered chicken noodle, the taste was above average but not up to the mark and there was no ketchup or sauce provided in the package, I would request you to add it with the noodles because everyone would appreciate it.
The packing and quantity for the price was good.
Will order again from this hotel if needs be.

"35391956","The food here is not fresh . I ordered a talawa last night and IAM suffering from a bad stomach because of this stupid decision I made . Selling Stale food to cut losses is just unethical from the business point of view as well . ",1,"2019-03-22 12:03:57",29,11,0
"52498672","I ordered food from Hotel Alhamdulillah. Not only did they take a long time to prepare, but the food wasn't edible either. They didn't even add salt to it and the meat was undercooked. My friend vomited because of this. ",1,"2019-03-15 15:15:46",1,1,0
"41158452","I have to give a honest rating about the food. I have order chicken noodle from this place.As soon as I opened the box, it started smelling badly. They have given wasted food. I think that's the restaurant policy to sell anything..not taking care of customer health. The quality is so bad that, you will vomit by the smell of it.
Note- Zomato should take stern action on these partners who does not maintain the quality of food. ",1,"2019-02-23 03:09:38",1,4,1
"1774947","Are you guys seriously da branch of nampally outlet? I don't think so ..taste of biryani or anything you order from here is awful and tasteless. I suggest you to close down your restaurant than torturing the public like this. Total useless ",1,"2019-02-01 14:51:49",3,42,0

"46652328","please don't get cheated by ordering from here. this is here only to ruin the Nampally Alhamdulillah's name. I ordered full talava ghost (Rs. 185) and it was not even half the quantity of the talava that you get from Nampally for Rs. 100. ",1,"2018-12-30 22:27:37",1,1,0
"16244215","I have ordered for a biriyani, and the food what I have got from this particular restaurant is spoiled and stinking very badly zomato also is not serious about them zomato just needs our money not our safety, people please be careful about this restaurant, this is not even a restaurant it's a Bike garage kind of place where they sell food only through online order.

"75881151","I ordered talawa ghost with roti. The rumali roti they provided was half cooked and hence got upset stomach. The beef was also little little hard to eat. I had great expectation when I ordered with Alhamdulillah. Their nambally centre offers nice talawa ghost. But gachibowli centre is disgusting. My sincere advise is not go for this branch and if you really want to have good beef and roti items, go for other branches of Alhamdulillah ",1,"2018-12-13 14:08:41",3,1,0
