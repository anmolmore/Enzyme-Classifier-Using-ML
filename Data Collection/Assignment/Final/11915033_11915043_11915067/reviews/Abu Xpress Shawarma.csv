"51298166","I placed an order from this place for an item and two add-ons. They accepted the order but didn't deliver the add-ons. When I enquired, they said that the item was not available. So, in short, they accepted the order while having only a third of the items in stock and won't even show the common courtesy to call you and let you know the issue and offer any alternatives that they can provide. This is extremely unprofessional behavior and shows a lack of respect for customers.
PS: The one item that I got was definitely mediocre in taste. Nothing special like the other reviews suggested. The portion size was fine but the styling (taste) was that of a road-side fast-food stand than a proper kitchen. Not that it is bad but just very different from what the other reviews would suggest.",1,"2019-04-07 10:12:31",3,0,0

"30327960","I wonder what these guys at Abu Xpress Shawarma add in their Shawarmas, but these Guys are by far the best Shawarma that I happened to taste..
Happened to Order a Chicken Sabbah Shawarma thinking what it would be like and a Chicken Shawarma along with Chilli Garlic Potato ü•î Shots & Chicken Popcorn..
To my surprise, the Chicken Sabbah had Boiled Egg White along with some really nice Grilled Chicken and their mayonnaise was tasting so good too..
Chilli Garlic Potato shots were really nice too..
Chicken Popcorn were very crispy and hot..
Very happy with the food that was delivered and the overall experience..
