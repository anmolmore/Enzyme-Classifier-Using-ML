"34407330","Where shall i start?
This place is a complete disaster in terms of, drinks, hospitality, hygiene and service.
Food tastes bad and when i complained about roti, that it was hard, reply was ""madam apne thandi krdi"". After repetitively asking for manager, he didn't come to see us.
Water n lime served to clean hands was cold.
Bathroom was pathetic, tissues all over n it was smelling of filth.
NOT RECOMMENDED.",1,"2019-05-01 16:36:49",120,2509,4
"39022892","Loved the food. We went to this place on a weekend night at around 11:00pm we thought there wouldn’t be anything to eat as it was the closing time ..but I was surprised that there were all items in veg except for butter naan and ragi sankati ..so for starters we ordered miriyalu panner tikka it was very good ...aloo Kaaram vepudu ...it was pretty normal ..here comes the man of the match baby corn pakora ....it was sooo good ....for main course we ordered panner butter masala which was fab and chapathi and we ordered green peas kheema pulao which was bomb ....we also ordered curd rice which came with a mirchi ...it was very fresh ,we also ordered samba Rice which was also great .....in the pulao the soya was minced and green peas were added to it ....I still regret that I couldn’t try Ragi sankathi for which we came and butternaan which is their best seller ",3,"2019-04-15 09:33:49",25,11,0
"84174874","good food great ambience... totally different menu and covers all kinds of varaities ....if you r in gachibowli a must visit place and paya shorva and yellamma mamsam pulusu are must try dishes",5,"2019-01-31 16:25:38",1,1,0
"35422959","The ambience is really good. The quality of the food is good and quantity is very good. Service is okay,not so great. Curd rice is one thing to try. The people serving are not able to suggest what to have.",4,"2018-12-01 18:21:30",91,126,0
"34009097","Let's say you go to a restaurant just by looking at a fancy board and expect too much. And it disappoints you so much and hurts your pocket as well as your stomach. Well, that's pretty much what I experienced at Kritunga- Palegar's Cuisine.
I went out with my family expecting that we'd have a good dinner. We had Jonna Rottelu (which was the only good item we had during the meal), Rayalseema Paneer Kura (terribly pathetic) and Miriyala Paneer Pakoda (okay-ish). We regretted spending so much money on sub-standard food, really. ",2,"2018-11-24 20:15:44",122,636,0

"33906369","This place is good for rayalaseema cuisine. Kurnool Kodi vepudu,chicken ghee roast are very good here. Always been a fan of biryani and pulao from this restaurant chain. Had biryani in multiple outlets of this chain in Hyderabad and Bangalore. Mamsam dum pulao delicious here ",4,"2018-11-20 12:44:57",17,215,0
"35728156","One of the best in class Sangati, Natukodi Kritunga Sangati, which is also the Restaurant's special item. Yummm. One must have to try it for sure. This has changed my love towards Sangati. I guess I already had 5 times in 40 days. MUST TRY.
And yeah, The ambience will make u really feel like having food in a high class rayalaseema theme restaurant.",5,"2018-11-17 13:28:53",1,1,0
"37427566","Ordered Biryani and tandoori chicken from Kritunga. Biryani taste was avg nothing special about it and tandoori was good. Felt there is a difference in taste offline and online order",3,"2018-11-12 13:49:20",8,1,0
"44644468","Very less items in the menu....very bad for veg people..very bad experience ..try to increase the menu and taste....the veg cuisine is very bad compared to non veg.",2,"2018-11-10 22:55:25",5,20,0
"8267981","This place is mainly famous for Rayalaseema/Palegar's cuisine. It has a vibrant and spacious ambience.
Coming to starters, we have ordered almost every Non-veg starter available in the menu. Of them all Nalla Miryala Kodi Vepudu and Kurnool Kodi Pakodi are really delicious with perfect mix of all ingredients. Rest of the Non-veg starters like Natu Kodi Ghee Raost and chicken Ghee Raost tasted mostly the same. Adding to these Fish fry is also really good.
In the veg starters Mushroom Kaaram Vepudu and Miryala Paneer Pakoda and Aloo Kaaram Vepudu are good. And the masala papad here is stuffed fully with chopped onions and tomatoes and with sprinkled lemon juice. This was really yummy.
Paneer Kabab was luscious and it was the best from the vegetarian picks. Alongside chicken wings that we have ordered was too salty. And one important thing that we have noticed is that the starters are served in very less quantity.
In the main course all the birya byni's are good but the curries that we have ordered for Butter Naans and Rotis have too much of salt in it even after specifically mentioning about the high salt content in chicken wings.
Please do try the Kobbari Kodi currey (chicken curry made with coconut ingredient) as the combination made out an fresh taste.
Service here is really good and all the staff are very much responsive with the customers. And also the order reaches your table with in no time and will be served hot. Do try this place if you are lover of Telugu/Rayalaseema cuisine.",3,"2018-11-01 02:48:23",64,540,4
"1533419","This is my favourite place for Rayalaseema/Palegar Cuisine. Must visit place in Gachibowli. Been here for 4 times and tried most of their menu and I loved it. Signature dish Mamsam Ragi sangati is must try here. Friendly staff and nice ambience. Only disappointing thing here is the price for the quantity. Too less quantity for the price we are paying. Hope they review it soon.",4,"2018-10-31 20:48:14",66,237,2

"20533","This is one of the most pathetic restaurants I have been to. The taste of the food is very terrible. The restaurant is very dirty and food served is not at all hygienic. The fish served was very stale and undercooked. The forks and spoons were stinking. When questioned, the staff went into a defensive mode and behaved rudely. Everything is unnecessarily expensive and insanely priced. They are overcharging for a bottle of water than it's MRP. AVOID THIS RESTAURANT AT ANY COST!",1,"2018-10-14 18:32:30",4,105,0

"31929629","There is one chain as soon as you hear their name your taste goes for a spicy valley ride. Kritunga does some spicy food which is something their significant USP. Kritunga palegar's cuisine serves distinct dishes like their patented Chicken & Mutton. Kritunga Ragi Sankati, Spicy Natukodi Pulusu, Yellamma Mamsam Kura, Karjam Soya Kura etc.
While many of the folks relate Rayalaseema food with just the spiciness caused due to extra chilli, the food at Kritunga speaks more about the right blend of traditional native spices that are used in the preparation of food.
Kritunga is one brand which is made available in every part of the city. This Branch in Gachibowli will help reach the corporate crowd.",4,"2018-10-08 07:37:39",128,5520,30

"27900555","Ordered like 10 family pack of chicken biryani last sat for office function and was thoroughly embarrassed. No trace of masala, was just raw looking chicken pieces with red basmati rice. They were certainly not prepared for the order, they actually could have refused it. I have been to other branches of kritunga and they serve good food. This branch is a big no. Biryani was dry, worst part was the chicken pieces did not have any salt, chilly etc applied to it, looked like a 3rd grader cooked. ",1,"2018-10-07 06:02:33",10,23,0

We ordered ragi sangati with spicy Kodi pulusu. Ragi sangati is a bit pricy for quantity served (110), but Kodi pulusu was totally worth for money. Even we had to order extra chapathis to finish up the pulusu after ragi sangati. Peices were well cooked. Worth trying. Cheers....!! ",4,"2018-09-03 01:19:48",46,23,0

I ordered Rayalaseema's special recipes Ragi Sangati and Natu Kodi Pulusu as my main course. I have to say that the best food from seema I have eaten in the city. The taste was authentic and I could relate to my childhood days when my mother regularly made Sangati.
I also tried Kurnool Kodi vepudu, which is a dry dish which puts Chicken 65/chinese dry dishes to shame.
Whether you want to spend quality time with your family or friends or new to the city or a food lover, this is the place to indulge your taste buds, I strongly recommend Palegar's experience.",4,"2018-06-11 12:35:11",1,0,0
