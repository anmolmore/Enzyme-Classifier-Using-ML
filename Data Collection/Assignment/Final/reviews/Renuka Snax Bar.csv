"34403078","We had Sabhudhana Khichdi, Aloo Bhajji and Gobi Paratha from this place.
Aloo Bhajji - 5/5 for this one. Aloo we're thin sliced, batter was not too heavy and crisply fried. There were coated with Salt and Spice powders. Also the quantity was good. 15-20 pieces.
Sabhudhana Khichdi - 4/5 It was piping hot. The Sabhudhana was tempered with Aloo, Red chilli powder, Kadhi Pattas and few Green chillies. Taste wise also good.
Suggestion : Tempering with green chillies alone and also topping with coconut might increase the taste !!
Gobi Paratha : 3/5 Not too spicy. Well cooked on inner sides. Can be improved overally.",4,"2018-11-10 00:53:04",91,177,3
