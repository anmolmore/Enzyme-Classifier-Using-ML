"30527407","I had ordered 5 chicken tikka burger from KS bakes. The burger was super sweet, something one would not expect from a chicken tikka burger. Also the chicken was not cooked well, and didint seem tikka pieces any way. The bread was sweet and had a sweet fragrance to it. I don't know if it's their speciality to serve sweet burgers, but I didn't liked it a bit. It was my 1st burger order from K s bakes and I would not recommend anyone to order burgers from there. Not sure if it was a one off thing but all the burgers were sweet. üòÖ Quantity was good though.",1,"2019-05-11 19:27:28",3,29,0

"3074831","KS Bakers stick to the tried and tested spread of options - pastries and quick snacks. They have a wide variety of baked pastries and burgers along with cakes too. 
Their space in Gachibowli is quite roomy yet simple.  On the whole, a must visit if you want to receive quick service and decent food. ",3,"2019-02-05 01:36:15",46,129,0
"36263035","I really like this place for its pastries, cakes and biscuits. I see it a real competition to other bakery in the area. My favourites are bournvita cookies and pastries and also choco almond pastery. I would personally feel that their fast food or snacks could be improved in taste and the way it is served. Also I personally do not like it self service scheme here. This does not mske you feel privileged as you feel when you are entering the shop. Also, its announcement system is too bad. Makes you feel like on a railway station. Hence stars cut as these are part of ambience.
Overall the products are good and one can always try them. Prices are midway and therefore acceptable.",4,"2019-01-31 23:04:48",59,182,2

"38233169","A new place that slowly turned out into a hangout eatery for people with shallow pockets. The lighting & ambience is warm . I love eating the chicken roll that hardly costs 35 bucks . A burger costs only 70. Lot of University students depend on KS for a cheap dinner delivery. You get free chips with everything you order .
But personally I felt the cheese they use is a bit weird & about sweet for the taste of a traditional Pizza hut afficianado.",3,"2018-10-20 12:21:38",49,283,1

"41983142","I often visit this place. It does offer good food and seating.
The expense to satisfaction ratio is good. One can always kill their hunger here without burning a hole in your pocket.
Amidst all the fancy food establishments with their over priced items, KS Bakers does stand out. It offers good food at relatively low prices. The place is never too crowded, so one can always manage to find a seat on the first floor.
I had their Chicken pizza, chocolate milkshake, red velvet pastry and all varieties of their chicken burgers, not one is disappointing. All the items taste good. I might specially praise their chicken cheese burger because that is my all time favorite.
They have to improve in the milkshakes department. ",4,"2018-10-01 14:52:04",35,30,0

The burger was disgusting. The patty had a weird cloying, sweet taste, and the mayo made it worse.

"8027731","A week back, I ordered a black forest cake from KS Bakers Gachibowli. All excitement died after the first bite. It was for the first time in my life (after tasting black forest cake a zillion times before) that I tasted a black forest cake with a strong lingering elachi flavour. After reading a previous review mentioning this same issue, I thought that the suggestion was taken and improvement/change would have been done. I am sorry to say that the situation of the black forest cake remains the same. I would recommend everyone NOT to try the black forest cake from KS Bakers. It is a true disappointment.",1,"2018-06-14 23:42:36",2,80,0

"33503433","So, we had a combined birthday celebration for almost five people and housing a team of almost 50. We decided to order cake from KS Baker's. Following is my experience on the same-:
Presentation- Looked lovely and the gum paste flowers on it just made our mouths to water. The colour was sharp and had the perfect blend of black and white. The presentation was superb. 4/5
Delivery- Got everything delivered on time. Nothing outstanding. 3.5/5
Cake- Now this is what was actually not good enough. The black forest tasted much different than any other black forest.
Black Forest Cake- A really huge cake for a good number of people. It tasted exactly like elaichi and nowhere like black forest. A damp squib. 1/5
Will I order from here again? The cake was a turn off but I would like to give them another chance because of the reviews I have read. ",2,"2018-04-27 15:31:08",316,1157,0

So I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich through swiggy and upon receiving the order I found it was grilled chocolate sandwich, even bill was wrong. Raised a complaint and got a replacement. This time I checked the bill which was correct but even then THE ITEM WAS WRONG. They sent veg instead.

"35358952","Well, all the time I have ordered here it has been Veg Corn Burger and Paneer Cheese Roll.
They are too sweet to be considered as fast foods.
The pastery I tried once was over moist. Don't know why but I guess the refrigerator wasn't working well.
The have a really good value for money. But I have seen that they don't make burgers and rolls at that time. They simply defrost the frozen food in the microwave and put in some mayo and sauce and give it.

"5029721","The burger was just decent but complete value for money at 75 bucks! The ""Premium"" Butterscotch pastry was a letdown though. Also ordered ""Tangdi Kabab"" and found it decent.
This place's USP is value for money. The rates are really nominal & easy on pocket. ",3.5,"2017-08-14 02:09:03",169,680,2

"39137427","This bakery is located at very prime location in Indranagar , Gachhibowli as many of good restaurants are located in same lane.. It is the center of attraction for food..Have heard many people so finally decided to visit this place..While I enter into the bakery the baking smell made me more hungry..I have ordered paneer burger and aloo tikki burger..After giving my order I thought to see what kind of bakery products they have..while I was at muffins rack, I saw the muffins and there was white fungus was on top of it..Very disappointing..They should change their show case items..
Then I got my order..Aloo burger was good but paneer burger was horrible..it was too spicy and only red chilly powder was dusted with mayonnaise..And mayo was too sweet..I was not happy with service as they have numbers of chain in Hyderabad then atlist they should maintain the quality..",1.5,"2017-07-21 18:29:37",148,2104,0
"32992096","Very Impressed by the Batman Cake they delivered. Though I was never a fan of their stuff(except the cookies) but the cake was made with sheer perfection as you can see in the pic. They very calmly listened to our requirements with a budget friendly deal whereas the other famous outlets denied for customized cakes and charged a lot. Happy customer üòä",4.5,"2017-07-17 14:27:35",6,70,1
"1601824","I ordered mini veg pizza, manchuria, veg hot dog , veg pizza bun... Machuria was good but it wasnt hot they just gave what was kept there, veg pizza was kind of nice but it has to be more crispy, veg pizza bun and filling inside was smelling worst as if its life span is over, veg hot dog was bad it was having same filling as bun... It was totally a bad experience and over that the A.C was not at all working.... Please improve the quality",1.5,"2017-07-09 19:29:10",32,107,0
"311505","It's a good option but the bread they use for hot dogs and burgers is something which has to be improved. Burgers buns are too thick and the patty and filling at times is way too oily.  They have pretty good dining area too on the first floor. The place is neat and service is pretty fast. Being an old brand catering to twin cities this place has always been a good option to grab some quick bites and lip smacking pastries.",3.5,"2017-07-08 16:28:33",140,929,0

"34009097","It's affordable, accessible and there's quick service. I had been to other outlets (Chandanagar, Kukatpally and A.S.Rao Nagar) and the experience in each was satisfactory. My friends dragged me to this place when it was raining heavily. It was one kind of adventure. 
I had Vegetable Burger. My friends had Vegetable Samosa and Chicken Roll. After eating a burger, I did not have anything for dinner. It was good enough for me. Go for it, if you want to have bakery stuff at lower prices. Great VFM! ",4,"2017-05-18 19:02:13",122,636,2
