"29027266","One of the best fine dining restaurant in Hyderabad . Superb ambiance and great service. I personally loved the place and the way they treat .
Tried spring roll, Tempura squid ,Drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. Fish tasted awesome. Overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.
Coming to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and Dak bungalow chicken. Pulao could have been better. One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.
Overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. Better to have a reservation during weekends.

"2505892","Food is great here. Surprisingly even veg food was good. we ordered variety of veg and non veg starters and food was simply awesome. Their staff is very coordial too. Live music and the goa feel adds to lot of fun. I believe the photographs talks itself for amazing ambience they have to offer. ",5,"2019-05-18 15:34:27",9,4,0
"109046150","Great ambiance, its a theme from Goa but I'd say its better than Goa itself.
The food was amazing, the service was great, and everything was organized.
My favorite dish out of all would be their pasta.
Would definitely love to visit again.",5,"2019-05-18 03:04:38",3,0,0
"37981430","Goan themed restaurant with great picturesque view and vastly spread. Great place to chill all around the day. The price is a bit on the higher side.
Ordered Zafrani Paneer tikka , amritsari fish tikka and butter garlic prawns for starters. Fish tikka was okayish, paneer nice and the prawns were delicious.
Tried thai green chicken curry with Jasmine rice for main course along with butter/garlic naan, daal tadka and paneer butter masala. Loved the thao curry.
They offer multiple options in cocktails and mocktails, however the prices are a bit high on the pocket. Had the best long island ice tea till date.
All in all a great experience. ",4,"2019-05-16 15:04:05",12,7,6

"2808962","Excellent ambience, great food and service... There starters, desserts and mocktails are absolutely delicious. The main course is above average. That's what makes this place a 5 star fine dining restaurant. They have different sections both open and covered and named under Goan beaches. They have a fresh catch section, from where you can choose fishes, crabs and lobsters and ask them to prepare it.",5,"2019-05-15 02:15:25",14,5,0
"32728257","Goan food at its best! This place is as good as it's sister outlet in Goa. Mimicking the Goan ambience, this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experience.
The food had great flavours, brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds. The southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! Great lighting and courteous staff.
Tried the south indian fish curry and rice. Probably not the best I've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.
Must try: masala fried prawns, kadhai jhinga, mutton xacuti, pinwheel delight (mushrooms)
Would give it a 4.5/5 just because of the prawns!",4,"2019-05-14 08:44:01",52,123,0

"31432992","One of the best places to chill in Hyderabad after a long week’s hard work. Love the place, the ambiance reminds of Goa and the food definitely yes. I love the prawns and the sea food, especially the butter friend prawns and the prawn Balchoa. The drinks added for the flavour, I would recommend for a nice evening, but check the reservations before hand, the first time I went had to wait for more than 25 mins. Service is great. Overall a 5 star rating. ",5,"2019-05-10 01:35:34",24,74,0

"4167021","This place makes you feel like you are at the shore of a beautiful beach in goa, sipping on your favourite drink and just taking the whole feeling. Designed to make you feel like your on vacation, it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me. Different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goa,making it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation. We had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourful.Mushroom tonak and Mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well. It is the place if u want to try goan cuisine. ",5,"2019-05-08 18:20:34",7,18,5

"54372212","Ya i Started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy, yum and many pieces were given too.This hotel is famous for sea food.Thought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in India too.I felt like limited edition of varities are a available here.then my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280.This hotel gave a Goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music too.cocktails and mocktails are available too.The waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures also.

"6124621","Went there as a group of 10 for lunch buffet. The place is easy to find and at the entry you have an option to choose either AC or outside. because of the heat we went inside. The starters and soup were served on the table. There were numerous starters and it was very good. the starters actually make you full. The waiters were very friendly and helpful. they had asked multiple times for the starters to be repeated. the main course was good and there was a huge spread there. the best part was the desserts which were awesome. Next time would like to go on a evening for the outdoor seating and ambience.",4,"2019-04-27 09:12:02",97,152,0

Food: Delicious. Exotic. Hygienic. We tried lobster, prawns and red wine. We wanted to try crabs and other kind of wine but that was not available. Maybe they should keep the menu items in stock. You may not get all the items listed. 10/10
Ambiance: Beautiful. Live music. Great lightening. For parties and a nice dinner. 8/10
Service: Satisfied. They prepare food just like you would like it, asking for instructions. Waiters were polite and nice. They served us cake as we went for birthday celebration. It was just a pastry but still nice gesture. 8/10",5,"2019-04-22 16:03:35",14,2,6

"34458689","#6packfoodie goes The Fisherman's Wharf!
Food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)
Ambience: 5/5
Courtesy and staff: 1/5
Zomato gold experience: 1/5
When we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""Outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.
Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.
Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.
Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.
Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.
Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.
Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).
The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!
This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.
We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.
Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.
If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.
Peace✌🏻",3,"2019-04-21 10:40:42",55,681,3

Tawa fry Fish is a must try.
Service is fantastic.
Music is mostly great.
Ambience is hands down a winner and good food along with a perfect mix of cocktails.
Goan style dishes would take your taste buds literally to Goa.
Special occasions like Diwali and Holi are also welcomed here like home.
Family or friends fits in good for both.

We ordered catch of the day lobster & Pomfret, Fish was very ordinary, the lobster was done well. Main course was super, prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours. The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

"1903288","Went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place. Had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try. 
During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. 
Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.
The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 
Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

It's a huge restaurant with very spacious seating...they have outdoor seating, indoor seating, bar area,buffet area, roof top area its pretty huge place..and every bit of the restaurant is amazing.. Ambiance is spot on...waiters dress code is good too. Service is amazing. They have perfect knowledge of what they are serving..and always ready to help dinners. Hospitality is awesome. But Only one washroom is a meh🙄
Coming to the food..i tried many dishes like thai green curry,butter garlic fried rice, stuffed crab, fish and chips, alfredo pasta, cheez garlic bread.
I order thai curry every time I go..it comes with rice.. its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistency...it tasted different all three times i tried.. It was good but different. Consistency matters!
Stuffed crab is amazing...overall must visit resturant. Its a expansive one but worth the visit..! I sujest night times around 7 is a good time to go. ",4,"2019-04-06 10:18:37",29,66,3

I went here as part of an office party. So can't really comment about the Al Carte.
The ambience is really cool. Full Marks to these guys for replicating Goa in such a great way.

They say 2+2 drinks but when you order cocktails they say it won’t be applicable as they use 60 Ml

"811014","This place is a paradise for seafood lovers especially it gives you the look and feel of the west coast. The ambience is something you can get no where in Hyderabad. A Goan themed restaurant with a bar attached has wide variety of sea food and the typical desserts of the west coast too. It is slightly expensive but it is totally worth the money. The look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise. This place is for friends, family and your loved ones. They have good variety of appetisers. Their service is very friendly. They do have valet and ample parking space. I have visited this place twice and I am so in love with the food and the ambience. ",5,"2019-03-24 15:45:01",81,247,8

A beautiful dine out place and especially if you are on a date. The live music was a soulful experience. Even without it, it had the right playlist. The ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical, romantic evening. The music is light, If you’re interested in a good conversation. The Mutton Roghan boti kebab was delectable. The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children. Overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location. I would definitely go back there for another amazing experience!",5,"2019-03-22 23:28:30",33,10,3

Parking: ample
Music: not too loud but entertaining and lively

"58828788","Fisherman's wharf used to be our fav joint when we lived in Goa. Excellent food and bevs.
Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.
We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.
In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.
Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.
We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.
Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.
Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.
Fisherman's wharf- such a disappointment.",1,"2019-03-19 22:30:38",1,0,0

"1972056","I had a serendipitous encounter with this place on a friday night, while we were driving along the Financial District road to enjoy the cool breeze post a day with shitload of work. As we entered the place, I was just mesmerized by the #beachvibes that it was radiating. The place was already full by 9p.m., but we couldn't resist taking a walk and absorbing the mood. Thereafter, we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then. The food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to get reminiscent of one of you Goa trips.",5,"2019-03-17 12:01:45",9,109,1

"40948069","Surprisingly well versed ambience. The place is massive with a get-away-from-city feel. They serve wonderfully cooked seafoods(Goan focused). A tad bit of coastal flavoured along with choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. I would recommend, to book table before hand; there are variety of sit outs to choose from. I would highly recommend this place if you’re a seafood lover.",4,"2019-03-17 01:01:49",21,246,0

"1610279","Sea food cravings. Close your eyes and reach this place in Hyderabad. A very wide spread variety of sea food. Can't pen it here coz you have to visit here. I have always been here for the love for 2 things. Crabs and only crabs. It is a must try speciality of the restaurant. The Goan preparation made with recheado masala.would rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied. Thats the fun of it. Ambience awesome . Staff too good. Feels homely. Love this restaurant more than anything. 5/5 for everything.",5,"2019-03-12 23:16:42",8,24,0

"802245","Ambience is really good. Lot of space, laid back ambience, mist sprays - perfect for a lazy Sunday lunch! Coming to food, recommend trying only Goan cuisine. Didn’t feel the Buffet was special or so but their Ala Carte is real good. Sea Devil is a starter that stands out - prawns wrapped in Beacon, perfectly grilled. Butter Garlic crabs are good too although slightly on the expensive side. Goan chicken curries are well made and taste good with plain steamed rice - Chicken Vindalho if you are looking for spicy or Chicken Xacuti if you want something less hot!",5,"2019-03-11 13:38:51",16,115,0

"2043230","Been here last February. Went for lunch buffet. Two options fish enjoyed regular buffet one price and sea food buffet another price!!! Once you go to a groan themed restaurant you need to try groan sea food. So went for the latter.
The sea food starters were not what we expected. Prawns were overcooked and rubbery. Fish was bone dry. When pointed out fish came out better on second serving. Main course although groan curries and cuisine, felt were tampered to the hyderabad palates. Dint feel the groan vibe except in ambience. Food was disappointing to my expectations after Bangalore experience.",2,"2019-03-06 11:00:36",34,821,0
