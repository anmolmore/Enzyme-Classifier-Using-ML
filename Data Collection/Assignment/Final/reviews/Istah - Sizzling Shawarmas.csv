"15390331","Not your standard Shawarma but you'll love it. It was delicious. There was good chicken filling and the chicken was succulent as well. If you're pedantic about your Pita Bread and Hummus, then this is not the right place for you, but if you can live with a major customisation then do try Istah. Minus 1 for calling it Shawarma :D Cheers!",4,"2019-05-14 03:25:08",207,400,0

Sometimes when you crave for good food at night Shawarma is one of the default options that comes to your mind. I have a strong liking towards the same but a lot depends on how well the chicken is cooked.¬†
I have tried quiet a few joints in the Gachibowli area and I guess Istah is amongst the top two for me. What i like about their shawarma is that it is well cooked and neatly packaged. From a packing standpoint i guess they are the best¬†
Shawarma Tried¬†
Istah Chicken in Rumali - good - my personal favorite¬†
Spicy Chicken Shawarma - good - my wife's favorite¬†
Istah Chiken Kubus - average probably due to the thick bread¬†
Overall definitely worth ordering if you live in the Gachibowli area¬†

"3093673","So one day my friend called for one of their rolls, sadly she didn't recall the name. I tried that, and it was so delicious, just the way I love it, lots of Mayo and their special sauce, and chicken cooked perfectly. So the other day, I called for their Istah's chicken shawarma in Rumali üòÖ it was good, but not as good as the previous one.

Then, hesitantly I ordered an Istah's Chicken Shawarma, the one filled to the brim with chicken. 25 minutes later, it arrived. I loved the packaging. I just hoped the taste was as good. It was better. I loved the Shawarma. The chicken had a touch of Hyderabadi tandoor zing to it and the garlic mayo complimented so well.

The packing was really good and attractive which a delivery only restaurant should have.
This is no where near to authentic taste of shawarma with all Indian spices put into it and I somehow ended up ordering chicken shawarma with rumali which basically meant shawarma with salad. Salad only had onion which I hate consuming raw.
Not so authentic and confusion from the menu didn't go well with me. Definitely a over rated place.",3,"2018-10-10 22:38:39",81,869,0
"873715","I ordered chicken Shawarma (khubus) aa home delivery so my review is not on ambience or staff but strictly on food.
The Shawarma was very delicious and non spicy. The Khubus bread was a little dry but that still did not affect the overall good taste of chicken. It was simple and stuffed with well marinated chicken, onion and Mayo . The only thing is, next time I should try Rumali Shawarma instead. ",4,"2018-10-09 00:04:08",40,32,0

"30127794","I‚Äôve been hunting around the city for paneer shawarmas, and Istah‚Äôs paneer shawarma is the hands down the tastiest one I‚Äôve had yet. Its neither too spicy nor too dry. The amount of garlic mayo might surprise you, but for me it was a welcome surprise. FYI the mayo here is eggless.
I got it delivered via Zomato. The packaging was very neat. It was so well done, I felt bad for ripping it apart before digging into the shawarma. I also ordered the Cheesy Jalapeno Poppers, which was also packed very neatly. The sizzling spicy dip was a nice touch.
Only issue I had was with the price. I felt the items were a little bit on the expensive side - probably good for me cause if it were cheaper I‚Äôd be dining here every day.",4,"2018-09-25 18:23:15",37,35,0
"1903288","Ordered chicken and falafal shawarmas from here on a late night.¬†
The first thing you will notice is the packaging. It looks professional and the shawarmas are nicely wrapped in aluminium foil. They grill the shawarmas so you can see the grill lines which add a nice touch of crispiness to the shawarmas.
Price wise the shawarmas are value for money. The chicken quantity was substantial as well.
The only downer for me is that I don't¬†prefer too many sauces in the shawarma. Unfortunately, while Istah folks provide quite a lot of meat in their shawarmas, its taste is subsided by way too much mayo for my taste.¬†
Would definitely give them another shot but would prefer to have low sauces so I can taste the flavour of the meat.
