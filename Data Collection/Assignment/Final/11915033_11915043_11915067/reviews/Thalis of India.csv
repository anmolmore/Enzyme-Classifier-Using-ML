"80982923","We were planning a Lunch party at home for 6-7 people and were too confused with the food. We made a plan to order some snacks with good thalis. While navigating, we came across this outlet called Thalis of India. We ordered snacks like Idli Sambhar, Vada Sambhar and main dishes like Kadhai Chicken Dal Makhai thalis and many more, and yes Shakes too.
Order delivered in around 1 hour, it was worth to wait for 60 minutes. Food was yummy and we all loved the packaging.
Awesome experience overall with them.",5,"2019-01-17 15:08:24",9,0,0

I tried shahi paneer and dal makhni thali,Am not a big fan of paneer but the shahi paneer gravy was spicy & sweet and i loved it also the dal makhni was good,

"1700577","Absolutely awful experience. Thought of trying this place today evening so I ordered a Dal tadka and Veg jalfrezi thali.
There was nothing working in favour of thali in terms of both service and food quality. I almost waited an hour for the food. Their veg jalfrezi was super salty and quite runny and dal tadka was bland in taste. Even if I could possibly ignore these aspects, I cannot expect the breads to be raw. Paranthas served were unfit for consumption. The photos are attached for reference.
Don't try this place at all guys.",1,"2019-01-03 21:49:04",275,1978,2

"29942723","Ordered kadhi paneer thali.. Got 2 table spoon of sabzi and rajma with lot of rice and paratha. How do you expect to eat so much rice with so less rajma and sabzi? Overpriced.
Please use your good mind and check your parcel containers. It definitely requires a bigger size pockets for sabzis and dal/rajma. Food is average and overpriced.
