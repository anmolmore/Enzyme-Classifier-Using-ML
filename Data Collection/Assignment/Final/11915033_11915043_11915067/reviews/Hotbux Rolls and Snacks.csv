I ordered Paneer Tikka Rollfor a quick snack.Â 
On a first bike itself felt like our regular Frankie. In deep fried white floor chapati small paneer cubes mixed in tangy chilli gravy. Great chewy tasting roll with right blend of flavours.
Seems like the cook is experienced Frankie maker to make such great taste.
However all seemed well, still it was oily and small in size. Quantity of paneer were little less than expected as per price.
