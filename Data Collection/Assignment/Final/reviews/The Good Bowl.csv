Had these 2 amazing bowls: Chicken Tikka Mac n Cheese Bowl and Paneer Tikka Rice Bowl ‚úåÔ∏è
.
Both were superb in their own way.
.
Just one suggestion, the content of cheese could be definitely worked upon. Then, these bowls would be unstoppable.
.
Overall, a great experience!",4,"2019-05-13 16:11:47",34,47,10

They took the responsibility that they would deliver the food instead of zomato vallet and later didnt receive the call. They delivered my food after lots of complaint and 50 minutes after the promised time. Worst experience.",1,"2019-05-12 09:58:10",2,1,0

A place I trust to get my kind of food bowl is ‚ÄòThe Good Bowl‚Äô.
They have lots of variety and it‚Äôs so yummy!
I‚Äôve tried 4 food bowls from here, both veg and non veg. All of them were lip smacking and delicious!
I also received a chocolava cake with my order, soo happy!
Will definitely order again :)awhitedandelion.me",5,"2019-05-03 02:25:46",73,360,0

"30921630","Ordered Dal Makhani Rice bowl and Malai Chicken Tikka Rice bowl.
Malai Chicken Tikka Rice bowl had yellow rice with chicken pieces, some gravy and some veggies. which didn‚Äôt taste or look like Malai chicken but more like chicken tandoori. This bowl tasted average.
On the other hand, Dal Makhani Rice bowl was really good. Rice had good flavours and Dal Makhani was upto the mark. There were also some veggies added.
Must try: Dal Makhani Rice bowl

"36387823","Had an amazing time tasting these ""GoodBowls"" ‚ù§Ô∏è
Delivered on time piping hot , these bowls contain a perfect balance of protein and carbs, loved their proportion of food.
Of chicken roast bowl and chicken tikka bowl with omlett , amazing combo with veggies like olives, bell peppers and corn!!
The rice is flavourful not spicy not bland, the chicken had a nice BBQ flavour to it.
However the gravy served along with the rice can beads much better and would be great if packed separately as it becomes too messy in the bowl!
Kudos to the team!!

"39209847","About Rajma Rice Bowl , Rajma was good in taste but quantity was very less compared to rice. And rice tastes more like biriyani rice less like plain rice. If you don't love experimenting with food and looking for the taste of home made rajma rice then it won't make you happy otherwise it's nice .. ",4,"2019-04-05 14:57:51",1,15,0
"4597451","Ordered Dal Makhani bowl today.
The Good bowl never disappoints you on packaging.
The garnish of bell peppers, corn, olives and onion, certainly is fancy.
Rice had good texture and was flavorful.
But the quantity of Dal Makhani in the bowl was way too low. Making it a dry bowl. And finding too many onion peels in the bowl was off putting.
So, my experience is a 2*",2,"2019-04-01 11:31:00",7,134,0

Zomato was kind enough with a refund, but this restaurant people have even stopped picking up my calls.
Never ordering from here again. They should only accept orders that they can actually deliver",1,"2019-01-27 23:48:03",6,4,0

The chicken is really good and soft
