"20278600","Been here with mom as she was interested in tasting authentic Godavari delicacies. Simple yet standard interiors made for a pleasant welcome.
So here is the catch - I am a vegetarian & my mother is a non vegetarian.
She was very excited looking at thali exclusively dedicated for prawn based food.
I choose to try multiple starters in veg.
Mushroom fry & Corn bajji were the choices i made. 
Both of them were totally different, each one had its unique taste , mushroom is for people who love a bit of spice. 
corn bajji is a must try here especially for its unique, freshly made chutney.
My mother totally loved her thali , it isn't like other thalis where standards are compromised. She said it goes for a paisa vasool 👌
kaju paneer pulav is a great choice for vegetarians, simple but sure to tingle your taste buds. 
Ambience, cleanliness & most importantly attentive & courteous staff, serving quantity & of course the food fetches a 5 star rating.
My only request is- please increase the no of items for vegetarians.",5,"2019-05-12 11:32:50",4,58,0
"418203","Good Ambience, if you like to try Andhra cuisine( Godavari Style) you can opt this. We have tried Thali options both Chicken & Mutton, they were limited but good enough for single person. Mutton Iguru and Chicken Pakodi are good, curry items could have been better, Pulav tastes awesome as its little spicy. Sambar rice was average, curd rice was super. Worth a try.",4,"2019-05-05 12:30:33",31,115,1

"5574461","Located on the busy roads of Gachibowli, this place brings the authentic flavor of Godavari. Wanted to try their Thali’s so ordered chicken and fish thalis. And they tasted nothing less than perfect. The quantities were slightly more than what we can eat. The Sambar Rice is just perfect, The andhra fish curry has its perfect flavor. Their chicken Pulao needs a special mention and the menu has many more dishes which are from the Godavari.. If you are looking for the South Indian spice recipes, they have them right. The Ambience and Service is good. ",5,"2019-04-30 13:09:05",27,13,4
"44070595","We did not a have a good experience at all. While taking the order they said that there is no tiffin section at all as the chef was not there. So we said we can wait for a while if they could arrange for a chef, but we got a strong NO for this. But When we decided to leave the place they told they can arrange for a chef. This is not a good practice from the management side",1,"2019-04-20 00:03:44",2,11,0
"30785857","This is your go to place if you love spicy good food.
After some great reviews from friends we tried this place. We ordered some paneer pakoda which our 5 year old boy enjoyed a lot. Then came the mutton thali, everything on the plate was delicious not one dish that disappoints you. Very nicely put items. A complete 10 on 10 thali.
Then came in the star dish for me.....I think it's called the prawns special pulao. Never have I had such spicy food in these two years of my stay in Hyderabad. The most delicious Pulao I have had till date, I doubt I am going forget that taste ever.
A dish I will talk about to all my friends who love spicy food.
The ambience, decor and the staff are also very polite and helpful.",5,"2019-04-19 12:53:43",21,17,0

"47894683","There we were, just finished yet another busy day at work, all hungry and craving for something delicious and satisfying. Initially, the plan was to go to a Shwarma joint, but “Raju Gari Pulao” caught our eye and we were excited to check it out.
From the banks of Godavari to the bustling streets of Hyderabad, Raju gari Pulao opened their third restaurant in the city. The place was great, well lit up and the ambience was welcoming. It was around 2 weeks since they just started. The owner Mr Chaitanya, happened to greet us as he was there to make sure the place runs as expected. He was a smart gentleman who seemed to know exactly how to run a restaurant.
The menu was handed out to us and we noticed it was moderately medium in size with the number of dishes limited to a handful and yet they looked interesting. The authentic ‘Konaseema Andhra style’ dishes were definitely a fresh lease of air for most of us to try on.
We ordered starters, like ‘Mushroom fry’ and ‘Baby corn bajji’, which were nothing unusual. They seemed just like a dish, perfectly cooked to the right texture and flavour.
‘Mutton kheema balls’ was and interesting dish. Minced mutton balls blended with Andhra spices was coated in a batter and deep fried to perfection. Thumbs up to this dish.
Prawns pakodi was also very good. It certainly can be served with chilled beer and you wouldn’t be disappointed.
Boneless fish fry and the Karvepaku kodi roast are a must try and one should not miss them if they visit this place. The fresh aroma of the karvepaku (Curry Leaves) was clearly something you cannot miss in this dish. The taste of the dish was elevated to another level. Also the chicken used is not the regular Broiler chicken, but they are the Naatu Kodi variety you get in the rural areas.
The fish fry was very tasty and homely. It reminded me of my mom’s ‘fish fry’ recipe as the choice of the fish kind of made the whole difference, with bear minimum number of bones to uplift the flavour.
Main course dishes we ordered were the restaurant owner’s personal favourite and the popular dishes there, Chicken Sambar rice and Special Prawn Pulao.
We the team of “WhereInHyderabad” vouches for the main dishes we had like ‘Mutton korma’, ‘Kodi kura’, ‘Konasima Chapala pulusu’, ‘kodi pulao’, ‘Special prawns pulao’ and the epic ‘Chicken sambar rice’.
The ‘Konaseema Chapala pulusu’ was very well cooked with the right amount of tanginess to it and it tastes best with plain white rice.
‘Chicken Sambar Rice’ was the dish that won the “Koffee with Karan Hamper round” by far the tastiest sambar rice with fried chicken pieces submerged in it was served piping hot.
We also had their best and most ordered tiffin dishes in the menu. Nice and crispy ‘Chitti gari’ with ‘Kodi kura’, ‘Pandemkodi kura’, ‘Mutton kura’. We also had ‘Appam’ and ‘Pulkas’ with these dishes. Finally, to cool this off we had ‘Lassi’ and ‘butter milk’",4,"2019-04-08 19:53:04",74,97,11
"440166","If you have been staying in and around Hitec City, Hyderabad you wouldn't know about this place. This restaurant has come up in place of Moti Mahal restaurant which used to serve North Indian cuisine.
So, we entered this place by chance and found it to be pretty good. The setup is identical to that of Moti Mahal restaurant besides the dishes served. I really don't have any idea about all the dishes. But, we ordered a couple of their pulao. To be specific one was the Kodi Pulao and the other was Fish Pulao. I found both the dishes to be upto the mark. Especially the Kodi Pulao was very good. It's basically boneless chicken based pulao dish which a bit on the spicy side.
I think it's good place to visit once in a while of you are staying in and around Hitec City, Hyderabad.",5,"2019-04-06 15:56:20",15,11,0
"33093114","Located above Ratnadeep super market.
This place is replaced by Moti mahal.
Ordered starter: mix veg pakoda, kaju paneer pulao and evening tiffin: chitti gaare with natu kodi chicken curry.
Mix veg pakodi is ok.its a pakodi with a mix of French fries,onion, mirchi pakodi.
Chitti gaare is good but  natu kodi curry is not upto the mark.
Kaju paneer pulao is worth a skip.",2,"2019-04-02 23:06:24",439,1012,3
"14459641","""Spice Food for You""
The taste and craving for ""Spicy"" food is magical when you know the true value of it however if that is not your cup of tea, would still suggest to check out this place as they can adjust spice level according to taste. 
This is another addition to their existing and well received franchise know for good authentic food. Well there area many a kind which serve similar food but they have a different take on it. This place has very minimal attention in terms of ambience and have been given enough lighting.
Food is something that gets you hooked to this place and trust me personally being a spice lover i thoroughly enjoyed it here. Their menu covers most of the dishes found else where along with some traditional ""Bhimavaram"" dishes especially ""Pandem Kodi"". 
There is absolutely no problem with what you order as long as you know what it is and mention about your spice level to relish. Chicken Pakodi, Prawn Pakodi, Boneless Fish Fry were a few of the starters which kept me busy drooling. While the Idly, Dosa, Appam or Vada with Country Chicken and Mutton Curry is a pleasure to taste buds. 
Bhimavaram specials like the fry and curry is a must if you like country chicken and definitely do not miss their ""Sambar Rice with Chicken"" - one of my personal favorite here. I would recommend you to try their ""Fish Pulusu"" with ""Steamed Rice"" which is divine. Last but not the least is the ""Pulao"" and you must go with ""Prawns"" which is absolutely delicious. 
Well there are a few misses just like anywhere else for e.g. vegetarians find it a hard time to survive and might decide elsewhere. The most important of all is the location which is a disappointment and will only find it if you are looking for it.  Service can be improved overall but satisfactory!!",4,"2019-04-02 16:23:03",202,1148,17
"1039870","Excellent ambience.
If you like to try typical Andhra cuisine, this is a must visit.
We tried Thali options here- Chicken, Mutton & Veg. It’s limited thali only.
Starter: Mutton Iguru & Kodi Pakodi were awesome.
NV Curry: Chicken & Mutton r awesome.
Pulao: Average coz it had too much of spice
Sambar/Curd Rice: Super awesome.
Overall, it’s worth a definite try.",4,"2019-03-30 22:30:59",101,172,0
"32792467","So new place in town, heard a lot about spice levels and taste of the items on menu so had to try it.
The good -
1. Veg and non veg thali both packed a punch and for the cost had more than sufficient variety and quantity.
2. Pandem Kodi pulao - gud in taste but as always the issue with country chicken is meat on them. The rice is more than sufficient though.
3. Better than decent service and definitely a smiling staff
The need work items -
1. U can't have a restaurant without ice. I need my drinks cold so u better have ice cubes that I can use.
2. Seating can be a bit awkward for large groups
Overall a decent 1st experience, need to check more to rate better.",3,"2019-03-30 20:49:29",52,54,0
"15754473","The food that is served here is authentic and apt to the name of the restaurant. I'm a biryani lover, when there are days when I'd want to eat something else but biryani, pulav takes the next place. If you've ever tasted Andhra Pradesh's butta pulav, you'll be able to relate to the love for good pulav. The pulav served here tastes exactly the same. Also, the other dishes served here nothing but authentic 'Teluginti bojanam'.",5,"2019-03-30 13:32:52",29,109,0
"33916626","South Indian food has earned much fame across the globe. There are a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes and styles, with each holding its own uniqueness and habits. One such style is the Godavari, which is best served at Raju Garu Pulao. And it's sure to delight your taste buds!
A well lit interior with comfortable seating and minimal decor makes the ambiance of this place is just perfect. We started off with a few of their special starters; Mushroom fry, baby corn bajji, mutton keema balls, prawns pakodi, bonless fish fry and karvepaku kodi roast. All of these were made using authentic South Indian Godavari flavours, and each one of them were super delectable and delicious. My personal favourite were the Keema Balls, Prawns Pakodi and Boneless Fish Fry.
Next we had a few items from the main course; Mutton korma, Kodi kura, konasima chapala pulusu, kodi pulao, spl pranws pulao and Chicken samber rice. Mutton Korma was a one-of-a-kind dish that I've ever had. It was creamy and luscious with juicy mutton and tasted incredible with rotis. Both Pulaos were really nice, they were loaded with roasted golden cashew nuts and had a sticky, extremely moist texture that was just amazing. But a star treat was the Chicken Samber Rice. It was very palatable.
We also ordered some of their signature dishes from the tiffin section of the menu; chitti gari with kodi kura , pandemkodi kura, mutton kura, appam with kodi kura , pandemkodi kura, mutton kura, pulka with kodi kura , pandemkodi kura, mutton kura. All were delectable and delicious!
Something to drink is always necessary when you're having a heavy dinner, and so we had Lassi and Buttermilk, I had Lassi. We had a great time at Raju Gari Pulao, having something different from the usual and it was incredible. The service was also very good, a huge thanks to the staff. We will definitely come back for another Godavari style dinner soon.",5,"2019-03-29 06:54:23",57,1122,8
"38201383","A delightful place to try out the best of traditional Andhra and Godavari food. Started off from as a small start-up, they have now successfully grown to have four branches across the city.
I was there for a Monday evening dinner with friends and we ordered Mushroom Fry, Baby Corn Bhajji, Mutton Keema Balls, Prawns Pakodi, Boneless Fish Fry and Karvepaku Kodi Roast. I loved the Meat Balls, Prawns and Fish Fry. The spices used were mind blowing and made the dishes more special.
For Main course, we had Mutton Korma, Kodi Kura, Konasima Chapala Pulusu, Kodi Pulao, Special Prawns Pulao and Chicken Samber Rice which is one of their standout signature dish. Mutton Korma was fablulous, spicy and creamy with Phulka while the Prawns Pulao was great as well. Chicken Sambar Rice was nice, cooked to perfection and delicious.
We tried each of their tiffins as well including Chitti Gari with Kodi Kura, Pandemkodi Kura, Mutton Kura Appam with Kodi Kura and Mutton Kura Pulka with Kodi Kura. Each tiffin was a combination of their main items and were exceptional with traditional spices and flavours.
For sides, we had delicious Lassi and Butter Milk which made the evening complete.
Overall, a fantastic place for traditional Andhra & Godavari cuisine.",5,"2019-03-28 20:59:24",129,599,9
"69970310","Godavari Style cuisine at Raju Gari Pulao
Hello everyone! I’m back again with another review. It was Tuesday night and we started our trip from our office towards this restaurant. We were actually confused about the address but when we reached, we found that Raju Gari Pulao is located at the old place of Moti Mahal Gachibowli. It was quite shocking.
The interiors and lighting really impressed me. Earlier Moti Mahal had dim lighting which seemed very dark, but maybe that was their idea.
We started with their amazing appetizers; Mushroom fry, Baby Corn Bajji, Mutton Keema balls, Prawns Pakodi and Boneless Fish fry. All the starters are just ultimate, like mushroom fry was the perfect dish to start our dinne. Every time you have a meal, the starting dish and end dish matters a lot. Then we ordered baby corn bajji, it was just unique dish which was big and covered with besan and then it was deep fried, it was lip smacking. Then we moved to the leading dish of the night, mutton keema balls. Mutton was properly cooked with a crisp outer cover, it was just tasty.
Next we tried some sea food, in that we selected Prawns Pakodi and Boneless Fish Fry. Prawns pakodi was a new dish for me, and it left the best impression. They were crispy and perfectly cooked. Boneless fish was tasty and fresh and so soft to bite and well marinated. The taste of fish is best when it is fresh and here it was very fresh and tasty.
Now it’s time to move onto the main course. We were already full with the starters, but the main course was double in taste and everything so I didn’t want to miss it. We had Mutton korma, Kodi kura, Konasima Chapala Pulusu, Kodi Pulao, spl. prawns pulao and Chicken samber rice.
Every dish was breathtaking from mutton korma to the samber rice, I just loved them all. The special dish which I loved most is mutton korma, it was just lips smacking. Soft and juicy mutton and the creamy curry, it was amazing. And the Spl. chicken prawns pulao, it was the best pulao that I tried in a long time. And coming to the epic dish at the end, samber rice. We heard about samber wada but tonight we had samber rice, it was an the elite dish.
Then we moved to their signature dishes that is in the section, chitti gari with kodi kura, pandemkodi kura and mutton kura, appam with kodi kura, pandemkodi kura, mutton kura
pulka with kodi kura and pandemkodi kura. These were all just remarkable dishes, must try at Raju gari Pulao.
At the end we had Lassi and butter milk for refreshing ourselves. Thanks to Mr Chetan and their staff who served in a good way and it was the best South Indian dinner ever.
Must Try:
Mushroom fry
Prawns pakodi
Boneless fish fry
Mutton korma
spl pranws pulao
Chicken samber rice
chitti gari with kodi kura , pandemkodi kura, mutton kura",5,"2019-03-28 16:35:01",28,1624,7
"1878196","I went here for a quick snack. Me being a vegetarian, did not find a great variety. Actually about 10 percent of the non vegeterian choices. I have ordered for some mixed vegetable pakodi, butter milk, and fresh lime soda. All of them are good. Ambience is just average and the manager is very courteous ",4,"2019-03-24 20:50:09",22,15,4
"553112","After Middleeast food, we wanted to try something local and due to heavy traffic that day, we zeroed in on our nearest good place - Ulavacharu. When we stepped down our vehicle, we saw Raju Gari Pulao opened in the same place where Moti Mahal used to be there! It was a mixed news. Sad to see a place like Moti Mahal getting closed and happy that a new place with godavari food opened up.
Initially I thought its a total new place until I opened zomato and realised its the same place that I've tried few months back in manikonda, only place was very small there.
Regardless, we went in. No change in ambience from its predecessor. Service quickly came in and took our order.
Kaju kodi Pakodi and fish roast were part of starters. Though kaju kodi Pakodi was good, I've had better. Fish roast was made with rohu and tasted good.
Ordered Raju gari kodi pulao for mains. It was dry unlike few outlets where it is served wet. First bite into it and the flavors that pulao carried did magic on tastebuds and made me dig more 😋, though I would have loved a little more spice to it. We also ordered chitti royalla fry along with it. It was perfect in taste and added more flavor to pulao. We also had it with rice, but I loved it with pulao. We then ordered Konaseema chapala pulusu ( rohu again) and it was delicious, tangy and I'm drooling right now when I write about it. One of the best!
Overall it was a great experience and would love to go back to try more.
