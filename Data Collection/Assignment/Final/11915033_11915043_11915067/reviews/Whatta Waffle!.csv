"36263035","This is a small place at Gachibowli right next to the Bajaj electronics showroom. I had gone with my friend and we ordered couple of things like waffle sandwich, classic waffle and the bubble waffle. To be conclusive with my belief I would say the toppings are same here. What these guys are offering are the different waffle bases. But yes to be fair their waffles are really good. The thing that I did not like was that the place is too small and felt claustrophobic. This also created uncomfortable and non ergonomic seating arrangements. And I also felt that the serving portion could be better considering the price. Hence 3/5. ",3,"2019-04-11 17:34:14",59,182,0

"35151224","This place is located right behind Keventers. The interior was quite small and the stool I had sat on wasn't quite stable which kind of annoyed me and the chairs didn't exactly seem comfortable either. I had ordered kitkat waffle (belgian) and they were quick in preparing it. The waffle was served on a paper plate and the cutlery was plastic, it wasn't impressive at first glance.
Coming to the waffle, it was covered in milk chocolate and crushed kitkat, topped with whipped cream. The milk chocolate was delicious and it really went along with kitkat, the best part being I could clearly taste kitkat through every bite (which I can't say for most kitkat flavoured shakes and waffles). I don't usually like whipped cream but here, it blended well with milk chocolate topping and kitkat pieces. The waffle was delicious and I look forward to exploring the other items on the menu but I feel the interior and the ambience can be improved. ",4,"2019-02-18 15:48:35",14,31,2

"33167664","I've tried waffles from a lot of places and this place has some of the best waffles. I tried apple cinnamon and belgian¬†white chocolate. The packing was also nice. The only issue I have is the pricing. For Rs. 150ish you get HALF waffle. I don't know how this has become sort of¬†the standard price. You simply make the batter(that too in bulk most probably) and then put it into a waffle maker. This simply feels absurd to me.",5,"2019-02-03 22:23:23",15,51,0

Whatta Waffle has already managed to impress us with their amazing waffles, shakes & pancakes that they're successfully running their fourth outlet now in Hyderabad.
I was invited to review their menu at the Gachibowli outlet which is just behind Sholay the Bbq bike. The outlet may not be easily visible to your eyes but once you get there I bet there is no chance of avoiding it either.
This dessert joint is tiny-mini with barely 3 tables of seating but its menu ,esp their toppings are going to spoil you for a choice.
They have amazing range of crisp and hot belgian style waffles,fluffy pancakes ,refreshing thick shakes, wonderful waffwiches, puffles & savories.
I went with few other bloggers/food reviewers so managed to taste a great variety here.
THICK SHAKES:
Tried the Popcorn Shake. It was unique , tasted incredible and had full popcorn flavor and was so refreshing at the same time. You are a popcorn lover you cant miss out on this.
Also tried the very berry shake and mango shake which were fruit flavors and tasted superb. And their brownie fudge shake was out of this world. It was made using fresh brownies they baked so the shake had chunks of the brownies which was gooey and melt in the mouth.
WAFFLES:
Tried the Banana Salted Caramel Waffle and Bluberry cheesecake waffle . The waffles were hot and crisp and both of them had the right flavors as per their names. The banana salted caramel waffle had toppings of real banana and caramel and was a nice combination. The blueberry was tad bit sweet but yumm at the same time.
PANCAKES :
Instead of the regular size pancakes we opted for assorted mini pancakes which by the way were still big when compared to other outlets serving mini pancakes.
We tasted so many different flavors in this- blueberry, strawberry, milk, white chocolate, choco almond, nutella, maple, apple cinnamon, brownie, Belgian dark chocolate and butterscotch.
Of all the flavors I absolutely loved the choco almond, nutella, apple cinnamon & brownie maple. They literally energized my soul and tasted supremely good.
WAFFWICHES:
Waffwiches are when the stuffing or ice cream Is placed between two pieces or layers of regular waffles. In this range we tried two variety which were Almond crunch waffwich and cookies and cream waffwich, both were delicious.
PUFFLES:
Since people have trouble eating bubble wraps the team at Whatta waffle came up with the idea of Puffles, wherein they serve the bubble wrap in a plate instead of conical shape wraps. We tried the Triple chocolate puffle which came with dark,white and chocolate syrup dressing and looked breathtakingly beautiful and tasted even amazing and was also hassle free to munch on.
Everything here is mind bogglingly amazing, value for money and to the point. And even though it's a small place it's well maintained and the host were genuinely such nice people.
The best part is they have placed hand sanitizers on the tables which just makes me give them an extra bonus point. Kudos !
Their menu makes you go drooling and definitely makes you scream WHATTA- WAFFLE üíï

They serve amazing waffles!!! Have tried the classic Belgian style Waffle with assorted fruits. This one is pure perfection.
Thick Shakes- Finally a place that has got the consistency right. Neither too thick nor too dilute.

Whatta Waffle, which has its outlets in Madhapur and Jubilee Hills, is now in Gachibowli. We were here to checkout their menu on a Saturday evening. They serve Belgian Style Waffles, Puffles and Waffwiches in a vast variety of flavors. We tried many of those flavors and among them the following stood out
Brownie Chocolate: The brownie was perfectly gooey.
Nutella: Everyone's favorite.
Banana Salted Caramel: A good combination to try apart from the usual chocolate ones.
Choco Almond: The crunchy almonds went well with the chocolate.
Dark Belgium: Liked the smoothness and texture of the Dark Belgium Chocolate served with the waffle.
Triple Chocolate: It was a combination of dark, white and milk chocolate which tasted great.
We also tried their assorted mini pancakes, Apple Cinnamon Rush, Choco Almond and the classic Honey Maple Butter were the best.
They also have a great variety of thick shakes, smoothies and quenchers. Their Popcorn Shake was amazing and surely a must try. The other two thick shakes, Brownie Fudge and Chocolate Hazel Nut were also great.",4,"2018-12-14 00:53:03",169,1259,7
"573349","It was only a few months back that this cute little joint from Mumbai came to town with their first outlet in Madhapur and after garnering such an avid popularity in town, it's only natural that the brand expands far and wide after setting their foot deep in the hearts of the locals. Located right alongside Keventers and Ratnadeep in Indiranagar Gachibowli, this outlet of Whatta Waffle is strategically placed in the heart of the food market of the area. 
The thing that I personally like about Whatta Waffle is that even though they are serving just waffles, they have brought in a myriad classifications within them being the WaffleWich - a crispier variant having goodies sandwiched inside, the Belgian - the classic waffle with slight crisp exterior and cake soft interior and the Puffle - bubble waffle served with loads of ice cream and other toppings. Apart from that, their menu also sports delicious pancakes, savory waffles and some thirst quenchers to cool you off in the perpetual Hyderabadi sun.
Coming to the food, I ordered for their Salted Banana Caramel Belgian, Chocochip and Gems Puffle and the house special Assorted Pancakes which for me has kind of become a must-order dish whenever I am visiting them. On the owner's recommendation I also ordered the Popcorn Shake, a concept which sounds quite astounding at first but boy that milkshake was good. A hint of the smoky popcorn overtone with the sweet thickshake was complete bliss in a glass.
Banana Salted Caramel Belgian again was a great dish with the salted caramel doing a great job in cutting through all the sweetness, providing a fine balance of flavours. Chocochip and Gems Puffle was one that actually surprised me as it looked exactly like those sinfully indulgent desserts you often see in magazines and food channels. A crisp bubble waffle loaded with milk chocolate drizzle topped with a generous helping of gems and chocochips and to top it off, a scoop of vanilla ice cream - pure heaven. Assorted Pancakes are ofcourse my all time favourite having 6 soft and fluffy pancakes topped with different flavours like Dark Chocolate, Swiss Choco Almond and many more.  
The service too at Whatta Waffle is on par with the good food. The place currently is tad bit short-staffed as they are still setting their foot in the game, but I am pretty sure once it's all done and dusted the place would definitely be something that their competitors might want to look out for. In a nutshell, with the variety on the menu and current pricing this place easily lists in the top waffles places in the town and most definitely becomes worth a visit!instagram.com",4,"2018-12-12 00:44:52",241,3414,4

We visited the recent outlet of Whattawaffle yesterday and realized that the name it is garnering is all well deserved. This outlet is relatively smaller and can accommodate around 10 people. It is located right behind Keventers(next to Ratnadeep) in Indira Nagar.
.
What we tried-
1) Popcorn Shake- The flavours in this one stood out really well. I'd strongly recommend this one if you wish to try something different from the regular routine flavours.
2) Banana Salted Caramel- This one is again a really fresh and new flavour that I tried here. It had a perfect balance of sweetness and salty flavours. Definitely one of their finest preparations.
3) Chocochips and Gems Puffle- This one was another category of puffle waffles that they serve. It was drizzled generously with chocolate sauce and topped with gems, chocochips and a mighty scoop of vanilla ice cream.
4) Assorted Mini Pancakes- This platter has 6 mini pancakes in the following flavours:
Blueberry cheesecake
Strawberry
Butterscotch
Milk chocolate
Dark chocolate
Swiss choco almond
The pancakes were really succulent and delicious. The taste of each flavor stood out distinctly and the overall presentation was really tempting üòç
.
One of my favourite waffle places in town with an impressive variety and interesting new options.
