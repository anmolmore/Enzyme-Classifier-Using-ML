"12212881","They don't have a proper menu to choose from. The only menu card available is a small board on the table. Food was good but had a lot of oil in it. The bill showed a different item to what we ordered and when asked about it they said the prices in the menu are wrong and hence we had to do this. All the prices in the menj board are miss reported as said by the waiter.",1,"2018-08-10 07:28:06",4,0,0
"38732040","We had ordered a simple veg thali. To our, and as is believe the other customerâ€™s sheer dismay, the rice was undercooked, practically making our meal inedible. What was even more outrageous was that even after we had complained to the staff about the issue, we were once again we presented with the same undercooked rice, only this time reheated.",2,"2018-07-28 14:31:40",1,1,0

A must visit place for all those who want to try out Andhra food. An amazing and very courteous staff treated us truly like a king. Thanks for the memorable experience guys ",5,"2018-07-05 09:30:20",51,2438,0

"29032517","First impression was that it is a remake of Simply South. But the experience is much better. A true South Indian restaurant in a different way. Tried the tomato corriander soup. A bit spicy but felt good. Chicken pulao and chicken dum biryani are at par with the best. Egg kothu paratha was awesome. Overall it is a tasty affair. Staff are very courteous. Ambience is excellent for family and friends alike. A sweet touch is the lovely Telugu songs from the 2000's playing in the background. Would love to go back. Slightly on the expensive side but it's ok for a pleasant evening.",5,"2018-05-23 20:32:47",5,5,0
