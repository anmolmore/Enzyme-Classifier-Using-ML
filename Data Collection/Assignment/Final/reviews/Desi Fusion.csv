"1874218","I've ordered bhindi fry, ghee roti and phulka roti.
The ghee roti was absolutely perfectly cooked was exactly how a roti should be i.e. Slim and soft. The phulka roti was a bit thicker but okay.
The bhindi was good but not upto the mark and the quantity what we get in that price is very less.
They should've add some more quantity in it.
Overall rating -3.2/5
Bhindi fry - 4/5
Ghee roti - 5/5
Quality -3.5/5
Quantity - 2/5
Packing - 4/5",3,"2019-04-17 02:55:13",10,13,1

"100074725","I won't recommend. Not happy with the quality. Just two hours ago ordered fish thali. Got rice, three rotis, Dal and fish. The first two items were ok. But the Dal was salty. The fish was overcooked. There were two pieces...a tail and head portion. Both tasted yuck. God knows how they cooked fish. Have to throw them away. Could not eat tonight.

"52721752","We ordered paneer butter masala with 6 roti(s).
To start with the review the panner sabzi was so awesome in taste but the roti was really a big downside it was slim and crispy like chips and broke at even a sensitive touch, all in all the sabzi was amazing but the roti was the worst one I had ever tasted even my hostel serves better roti than that what we found in the order",2,"2019-02-24 09:45:30",24,8,1
