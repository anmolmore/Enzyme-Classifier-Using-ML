"2717132","I was a initially a little sceptical to order my food from a new place with no ratings and reviews. But considering that it had the kind of food I was craving to eat and the fact that it was close to my area, I decided to give it a try. And here I am writing this review immediately after finishing my dinner as being in Hyderabad the food reminded me of Delhi food.
I had ordered Aloo Pyaaz Parantha and Dal Tadka, and with the portions size and the quality it offered, the price is more than reasonable. The Paranthas are tandoori with good amount of stuffing evenly spread across and cooked in the right amount in the tandoor. The Dal Tadka was yet another item with the right amount of spices and cooked to perfection. The Paranthas came with coriander chutney and pickle. To makes things even better it came piping hot and it gave a fabulous experience.
For people wanting to eat North Indian food with the right flavour, this is the place you must certainly try as I certainly said Oye Hoye Balle Balle after having my food.
P.S. one suggestion to the restaurant management is to probably serve the chutney is a small plastic container than the aluminium sleeve to help avoid any spill over.",5,"2019-05-16 21:27:20",266,1558,6
