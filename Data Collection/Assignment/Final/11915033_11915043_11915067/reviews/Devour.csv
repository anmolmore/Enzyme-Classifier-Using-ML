"70280941","The food is amazing and the service is speedy and assistive. I ordered a Duo Chicken Pizza and it was delicious. The crust was crispy, flavoured and chewy. The toppings worked together wonderfully. By the end of my meal I was already planning my next order. Thanks.",5,"2019-03-18 17:53:39",1,2,2

Pizza - Spicy paneer pizza was the best pizza I ever had, it is overloaded with paneer and olives good amount of cheese.
Pasta - Veg pasta are the best at this place. The sauces in them were soft and qualitative. Tasted on point , you should surely try them out.
Lemonade - All the lemonade were good enough to give that relaxing and soothing feeling. They have the mild flavours yet outstanding .
Green apple and watermelon.
Rice - Veg pilaf rice was great with spices and feel like taste of india.

"36521042","The food is amazing here. The veg pilaf was really a amazing. The buttery flavour of the rice was standout. Other dishes which I tried were equally good (peri peri Mexican rice, duo Chicken pizza, spicy paneer, Caribbean spicy rice,fiery chicken pizza,green apple lemonade, blue Curacao lemonade, strawberry lemonade, watermelon lemonade, peach lemonade, farfalle Alfredo with broccoli, farfalle Alfredo chicken).
I will really recommend my friends and family.",4,"2019-03-16 16:11:36",5,4,2
"36263035","Devour is unlike other brands for food business. It is basically a remote kitchen only but I have been told by my friends that they have an outlet at the DLF as well. I am not so sure of it though. My friends treated me to a some pizzas from the place and I liked it. It was pretty much balanced in terms of taste and toppings. But since I am used to having my sliced completely filled, which I believe is the case with most Indians therefore I felt may be a bit more could have been added. Again the taste was also quite balanced and I could savour it without much discomfort.
To be fair it was quite a good experience of getting a food from there and I would just like to add that they could get a bit more generous with cheese and toppings.",4,"2019-02-21 00:32:55",59,182,4

"47087577","Dear Zomato and Devour,
The pastas were a crap, was not cooked properly and the pesto sauce appeared deprived of spices. 
The chicken was soggy and hard to bit conforming that it‚Äôs uncooked as well. 
With this I would like to warn you about your dropping quality. 
I consider myself a genuine lover of Italian cuisine. And, I would contemplate treatment like this to be quite offensive. I hope this wouldn‚Äôt be repeated in future, or else I will have to opt for other delivery services.

"33503433","Ordered from here for dinner. I found some things not at all upto the mark while some were better than average. Following summarizes my experience-:
Service- The delivery was got on time and there were no issues at all there. 4/5
Packaging/Presentation- The Packaging was good. The chili cheese Toast was in an aluminum foil bounded box while the Mexican Rice was in a plastic box. The presentation was okay, nothing extraordinary. 3/5
Food- We ordered the following-:
Chili Cheese Toast- This was a LOL item. It was just Amul cheese on toast with some green chilies on it. I could have made this at home. Do not try this one or you may just bang your head to the wall. The taste was fine but not worth it. 1.5/5
Mexican Rice- A quite good tasting rice. Garnished with tomatoes, broccoli and onions. The taste was similar to Cheetos if you have ever tried it. 4/5
Will I order from here again? Have seen on Zomato that the Pizza is good. Want to try the same. Will definitely not order the Chili Cheese Toast.",3.5,"2018-04-09 15:08:35",316,1157,0

"4532951","The good thing about Delivery Only joints is that they do few items, and they do it well. I had been eyeing to experiment from this place for a home delivery. 
Ended up ordering a Farafelle Alfredo with Broccoli, and thanks to Zomato Treats, got a Basbousa piece complimentary.
The packing of the pasta was quite commendable, and so was the quantity. I couldn't finish the entire thing in one go. Not only was there ample broccoli, there was a load of black olives as well. Only the overall taste was a miss. It felt quite bland despite being served with seasoning. 
As for the Basbousa, I am not an expert of how it should taste, but the big chunk of it could have easily satisfied the sweet cravings of 4! 
Probably, would try other dishes from them to be more conclusive. ",3.5,"2018-02-18 10:52:06",150,2105,3
