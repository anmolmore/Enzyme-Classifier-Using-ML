"112421887","We have ordered Schezwan chicken fried rice from 9Grill and I must say it is one of the best Schezwan chicken fried rice we haven eaten in Gachibowli, Hyderabad area. ðŸ‘ŒAnd it is especially for the people who love spicy fried rice.
I would definitely recommend it to taste atleast once. You can even order this from Zomato, Swiggy etc.
Price : 4/5
Quantity : 5/5. Sufficient for 2 ppl.
Taste : 5/5
Delivery : 5/5",4,"2019-05-14 01:23:43",2,0,0

"2977466","Another place very close to the hotel where I was staying in Gachibowli. Very much walkable distance too but the street on which the restaurant is pretty much lonely, dark and you get that fear of getting mugged.Â  First impression that the bar is very much dingy and the lights make it that way. It has a very hazy feel and the constant smoke inside the bar also make it that way.
I didn't have a good first impression but I did come here 3 times more later because of the proximity and also the prices.Â  The liquor cost is very cheap compared to the other bars around the area. The food also tasted quite good. I have mostly tried out the starters like French fries, Chilli Chicken, Chicken Lollypop & Dragon Chicken. Everything tasted very well and the service of the staff too is nice. They keep checking on you all the time and very courteous.Â 
Overall a very cheap option if you're in the Gachibowli area but ambiance wise it can be a lot better.",4,"2018-12-16 23:48:22",119,469,1
"41983142","The place looks good, on the whole. I've been to this piece a good number of times now and I've not been disappointed. Do logon to the Little app for money saving offers.
The price to satisfaction ratio is not so good.
9 Grill has a bar with No Smoking, a bar without No Smoking and a restaurant with no drinks. There are a lot of places around the area which offer way better service and seating at the same price. But Little app saves the pricey trouble.
The place looks like a cross between a desi and a fancy bar. Both the Bars are dimly lit appropriately with not so spacious table arrangement.
9 Grill serves tasty starters. I had their Chicken biryani and Chicken Manchurian. The biryani will not give you a Hyderabadi dum feel but it tastes alright.
I would recommend the place, provided one uses the Little app's deal. ",3,"2018-11-01 10:06:02",35,30,0

"34243542","Visited this place one fine evening. We were stags and were allotted a corner table which was cauzy and a bit too dark. The food was normal with no surprises. If you are opting an economic booze place then you can have a try. The menu has some variety but lack interms of variations. Hospitality is not that great. Overall a casual place with some extra normal food. Harish Raghava Chaithanya Krishna ",2.5,"2017-10-13 23:17:27",30,41,0

"16097008","I had been to this place last night, the entrance itself didn't give a good impression. Neither the roads r proper nor the entrance to the restaurant. V started with chicken manchow soup which was pathetic, noodles was old & soup was thick. V later ordered egg 65 & Bhutan chicken which was surprisingly good. For main course v had ordered chicken chatpata, garlic naan & pulka, this was good as well. Lastly v orders mango ice cream which was yummy. Overall I feel food was good only the ambience has to be worked on.",3,"2017-01-29 23:27:50",94,496,7
"1641223","food is excellent and I guess it's worth nd very effordable prices in total Gachibowli area surroundings. Whereas service it's good and Chinese & starters,kababs are really excellent whereas pullavs are awesome including Bilal biryan guntur style",5,"2016-11-28 12:30:56",4,2,0
"30432015","The food and service here is generally nice. The ambience is good too. Whatever we tried turned out to be good. Recommended for an occasional visit. ",5,"2016-11-15 10:59:25",71,250,0
"1366361","A friend referred me to this place and after the pathetic main course I definitely regret coming here.
When we reached here the place was empty and we got a nice seat. The interiors are well done with a village like atmosphere being presented. 
The place is dimly lit and does justice to the ambiance. The only thing missing was some background music. 
Well, now coming to the food, we ordered dragon chicken and garlic prawns for starters and both the dishes were okay. There wasn't anything to go gaga about. 
For the main course we ordered chicken chatpat which was recommended by the server and Dal Fry. But to our utter dismay we were told after 10 mins that they have run out of Dal !!!! So we ordered kadai paneer instead.
Now this Chicken chatpat can be counted as the worst Chicken dishes i have had ever. It had got ni taste and the description the server gave us and the end product and miles in between.
The kadai paneer was good though.
The tandoori roti too was way too bad and served cold.
In short, a terrible place.

"11846861","I went with my team for lunch. This was our second time to this restaurant. Hard to locate for the first time.
Spacious parking.
Food taste = 4/5
Ambience = 4/5
Value of money = 3.5/5
Service = 3/5
Veg starters & main course was well cooked. You will feel satisfied.
As per my team's comments non veg also taste well.
The restaurant has Telugu/ Rayalseema ruchulu in their menu which attracts customers. Full justification was done with Telugu/ Rayalseema cuisines.
The only thing which was a drawback was Service. You have to wait for a long time to get your order served. For me after food taste, servicing is having higher priority than money and ambience. This was our second time to the restaurant but there was no improvement in terms of servicing.
9 Grills staff has to improve their servicing (atleast reducing the wait time after order is placed) for rising up in the market.",4,"2016-09-17 20:36:12",21,86,0

"16255534","The restaurant was bit difficult to figure out found it while passing on road 
When we entered the interior was attractive with a traditional touch and ambiance was very good 
Started with starters-Drums of heaven(wet) and chicken maongolian was finger licking should try for sure 
They have vast menu with telugu ruchulu with different regional foods 
Tried guntur  Bilal Biriyani(mutton) and kodi vepudu and chicken biriyani they were spicy and tasty which made me feel the traditional touch up finally totally liked it very very much 
I recommend it worth it",4.5,"2016-06-09 08:07:53",14,72,2
"15697596","Wow this new place is one good experience of nice tasty food.
Its would be a bit difficult to locate this place. It somewhat gets lost, as the approach road to this place is not good.
The ambiance is really nice. The walls are given a tradition touch. The place is quiet neat and tidy. They do have separate cabins for some private dining experience.
Contrary to the name. This restaurant specializes in more authentic Andhra food.
We started off with dragon soup, its was very good. The starter Chilli Paneer was excellent and the tandoori chicken was just amazing. With help of some of the reviews, we tried the Guntur Bilal Mutton Pulav, its was pretty good, but we more liked the Chicken Dum Biryani, it was very sumptuous. The chicken was tender and juicy, full of flavor.
The service was very good. The staff were courteous and prompt.
Only thing we had a concern was the Lemon Soda, it tasted very bad, looked like the lemons were spoilt , that disturb our very good experience of this restaurant.
They dint charge us for the spoilt soda, but still it spoilt our good taste. These kind off things have to be taken care by the management.
Since its a new place, hope they keep up the good work and not get carried away.
Overall it was a very good experience and would definitely like to visit again.",4,"2016-06-02 18:27:37",197,519,14
