We expect the food to be decent enough to eat. I ordered chicken biryani on March 14th night. It isn't biriyani, it's swollen rice soaked in turmaric and spices ( maybe couple of them ) with extra added salt and an half cooked chicken for the sake of 'chicken piece' in the biriyani. We aren't absolutely eating free of cost, I hope food served for free at least tastes 200 times better than what you giving to your customers. This isn't the first time that I am disappointed in you but this time I wouldn't stop myself from writing to make your place a better place.
Please take this feedback seriously and watch where is it going wrong. Otherwise you would be left with your staff to feed each other. Importantly you disgust a hungry person, nothing would be wrost that this.",1,"2019-04-13 10:46:01",1,0,0

"33670707","Ordered Omelettes from here 3 of them. Mentioned in the instructions NOT to add chillies and they have added them anyway and there are egg shells in the omelette. They probably don't care about the reviews of the way they run their restaurant. I do because its my money and I care. Never ever ordering from here.",1,"2019-02-21 22:24:50",4,1,0

It tasted like as if I am eating turmeric.
