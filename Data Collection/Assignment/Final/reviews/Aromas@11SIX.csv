"469689","This place is located in khajaguda. It used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste, quantity and pricing. I used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week.
Food is no doubt good..their soups, starters dal makhani, etc.. However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden.
Prices have been almost doubled . I used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs.. I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50% is really a good decision with no changes in ambience. ? I believe their main USP was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience.. Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience..
With hike in prices, customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience, fancy cutlery on the table .. well decorated tables , and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use, well dressed waiters.. etc..
Hope the management would rethink..",3,"2019-05-05 10:24:50",7,6,0
"166651","This review was long due. Located on the Khajaguda Road this restaurant claims to be part of the Gachibowli cluster and when I asked the owner he said he was just on the edge of Gachibowli and, therefore, technically they are in Gachibowli. The place has good parking and nice natural setup which has still been maintained despite the recent road construction.
Coming to the food we went for the Gulaabi Chaap after checking on Google, unfortunately this is the only place in India that offers this dish and we had no clue about the dish until we got it. Simply put it was amazing, mild rose smelling chicken cooked in the tandoor and served with mint sauce. It gave a heavenly feeling. Next on the list was the Chicken Momo which was soft and fresh again reminded me of some amazing momos I had in Manali. I hope some day they make Mutton Momos as well.
Butter Chicken was by far the best in town which went very well with another amazing bread called the Malai Warki Paratha. It was soft and was melting in the mouth with the Butter Chicken. Seemed like a match made in heaven. Much said about the main course we went for their version of Special Biryani. As is known from my reviews I don't eat too spicy food and this was just the perfect spicy level one could ask for. It had boneless pieces of chicken pan fried and served on top of the Biryani Rice. The taste was good and to my liking. Our Vegetarians friends were enjoying their Daal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala which was again good and their Veg Biryani as per them was equally good.
Thanks to the friendly staff we went on eating for close to 2 and half hours without feeling the time passing by. The large projector added to the aura of the place and we enjoyed the IPL on the large screen. They offered us a 20% discount and another 10% on our next visit apparently one of their limited time running offer. Thank you aromas@11six for being such a good host and an amazing food. We shall be back again.",5,"2019-05-03 21:14:29",78,2464,0

"1961006","I did not like this place at all. This restaurant do not match zomato gold standards. First thing , the price and ambience do not match at all. This place looks like a shady dhaba from highway but prices for food compares to ohris restaurants.
Even if we ignore prices , taste and services are worst that I have encountered in any Zomato Gold restaurant.
This place do not deserve 4+ rating. Totally disappointed.

"31609772","I have been ordering from this place for a long time. They are fantastic in terms of following any specific instructions you might have when you order via Swiggy or UberEats. The food is as described, there is no overdose of spices or oil. The menu is varied. I have tried Chinese and Tandoori dishes from here, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. This is my first choice when we want to dine in. My favourite dishes from here are Chicken Lababdaar, Kafuli and Chicken Afghani.
I took away one star from the review as there are rare issues with quality control, like tandoori kababs were once a little burnt.",4,"2019-01-20 20:59:15",10,1,0

Food is average. Few items very bad mainly their special biryani. Oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
It is not so happening place.
Their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

"8621791","Food: ordered crispy honey chilli potatoes, kafuli, shaam savera and naans, everything was spiced appropriately. Kafuli was less spicy and shaam savera was good in taste nor too spicy nor too sweet, a tangy taste of tomato gravy. 
Service: a little bit slow as there were only few tables occupied but i think they have just few staff members. 
Ambience: it has indoor and outdoor seating both, we sat indoor where a projector is mounted and songs were played. Ambience is overall very average.

The butter rotis were a little overcooked but ok. Service was also good. Points deducted for cleanliness as the outside area was infested with fleas so wasn't able to get the dhaba style experience (with benches and lanterns which made the outside experience desirable), the inside seating was good tough.

Food: We reached here just to have sizzlers as we wanted it and could find only some on the list being this one of them. We took sizzler again it was not what we thought of it was just about fine. Then we ordered panner tikka and something in non veg starters. Starters were good they grilled properly baked properly proper taste. We ordered some curries and naan again the main course was just about fine not great. Overall we only liked starters here.

"736954","Review No 514: In my recent visit to Hyderabad, I was introduced to Aromas@11Six. While the name sounds interesting, but I was not able to find the reason behind their name. 
Our teams in Hyderabad have been ordering food from here for team events etc for quite some time and hence when we ordered food from here, I was keen to find out how they fared. Here's what we ended up ordering over a few days from Aromas@11Six Gosht Rogan Josh: What a beautiful preparation of spices and meat. The meat in specific was cooked very well and the spices were also within moderation. I usually get scared with the spice level in such dishes but Aromas@11Six got it absolutely right with this dish. Butter Rotis: Even when they were delivered to us at home and as well in the office, they were warm and soft. Nothing beats such a meal on an unusual cold Hyderabad winter evening. Paneer Butter Masala: The quality of the Paneer used was excellent. The quantity of the gravy and the paneer pieces were adequate. I loved the consistency of the gravy and the balance in the spices used.  Dal Fry: Again, in many instances I have seen how it can go easily wrong with this humble dish. Thank you for serving this up well.  
Paneer Biryani: On of the days, I could not have non-veg food and ended up ordering their Paneer Biryani and it was filling to the core. The quality of the rice and preparation was nice. Thank you for not being stingy with the Paneer. 
See if you can check for some good combos on popular food app portals. That way you can try this great dish and club it with something else as well. Price: In line with the competition. They have tie ups with some of the popular food apps and hence sometimes we end up getting a good deal. Service: They have ensure we always got our orders within the stipulated time in spite of the rush in the orders (especially during dinner time). Ambience: We have only done take aways from here and hence going to leave this neutral. 
Here’s the final ratings basis my experience at Aromas@11six. I’m going to hold back a bit on the ratings because they have depth in their Menu and I would want to try them out more and perhaps revisit my ratings again in the near future.:
Food: 4/5 
Price: 4/5 
Service: 4/5

"48593408","I wish i had a 0 star option for this.We visited for the first time and it was a very unprofessional way of having food there. The service was although fast but the food was terrible. We ordered apollo fish which was not at all worth eating and the mushroom starter itself gave a unwilligness to eat. The main course we ordered was Murg and Veg Kolhapuri which absolutely had no salt in it. The restaurant couldnt even provide lemons to us even after requesting multiple times whereas they had cut lemons for finger bowl. A must “No” to this place. ",1,"2018-12-09 21:38:54",5,3,0

When I called the restaurant they say that it was the Zomato delivery guy declined it. I called Zomato and they say that the restaurant never responded to their call and so they had to cancel it. I called the delivery guy and he said that the restaurant told him that some one else picked up the order. I am not sure who is at fault here but I had a horrendous experience overall.

"32732002","The ambience was good. We 12 ppl went there for dinner. Some of us ordered biriyani, some had kulcha nun with Kadai murg. For starters we all ordered chicken drumsticks. Starter was delicious but they didn't provide salad and sufficient chatney. For biriyani they took much time and at the end when we tasted it we felt disappointed. They told special chicken biriyani and mutton keema biriyani are their special dishes. But the rice was sour. With biriyani the gravy they provided didn't have any salt. May b they tried to compensate. One of my friends ordered jaljeera which was the most humorous and worthless thing they provided and it took 40 Rs.
And about the service, it was good till we pay the bill. Frankly speaking we found this restaurant from dine out app and we wanted to pay via that app. But they showed some vague reasons and showed reluctance to accept. Atlast though they agreed.

We have ordered Paneer Majestic nothing extraordinary about it was good. Later we have tried Bhami Goreng, Veg Kolhapuri, Butter Naan and Murg Biryani. Bhami Goreng had very unique different flavour/taste which I liked. Same thing with the curry and naan both of them were really good. Special mention to Murg Biryani it was amazing.

"35029303","If you have no value for money then this restaurant is good to waste your money. Reason for giving 3* is due to veg curries which were told be good by my vegan friends. But, we, non-veg guys were totally disappointed for non-veg curries. It's got no taste at all. Chilli chicken gravy was like saucy-saucy. No spicy at all. Butter rotis were thicker than it usually has to be. It tasted like wheat flour and not maida.

Ambiance- Good

"34299757","Very very bad. The food was not of good taste and quality as well. It’s like throwing money in water. Just some fancy names they have kept for dishes but the standard aren’t even like for petty shops. In fact after having the food both me and my husband have got food infection. Pls close ur shop instead of making people sick.",1,"2018-07-30 20:34:07",4,1,0

"29147779","Situated a little away from the main road Aromas serves quite good Indian as well as Continental dishes including Chinese and Thai food. The cost of all the dishes are at the lower side as compared to the other restaurants. It has an average interior with both indoor and outdoor sitting. Though the service here is not so good but the food covers it all. I really liked the taste of the north Indian food that it served. It has true north Indian flavour. I loved Gulaabi Chaap which is a betroot kebab. Lehsuni dhaniya murg , Sholay kebab , Malai warki paratha, kastori kebab are the other tasty and aswumm items that I tried. Undoubtedly it comforted my taste and was happily back home .:)",5,"2018-07-27 16:18:45",35,959,0

"2290090","Went for a North Indian dinner! The place is a little out of way. The ambience is okay. It looked more like a college hang out place. There were only 2 people managing the counter and the tables. However the food was really good. Decent place for lunch or dinner and easy on the pocket as well( especially if you have Zomato Gold)!",4,"2018-07-18 14:50:02",37,26,0
