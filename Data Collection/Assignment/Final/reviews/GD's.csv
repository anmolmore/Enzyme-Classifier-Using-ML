The first bite when I had it was like how come I missed this kind of taste. Awesome must try cheers. I go with mercury burger üçî as I am a cheese üßÄ lover. üëåüèª",5,"2019-05-12 03:57:37",3,30,0

"42353640","I have taken 2 stars out only because of the time they took to make the burger. No doubt, the burger was very juicy and tasty but the time they took to make it was far too long. ",3,"2019-03-31 23:47:27",42,137,1
"29152423","This is possibly the best burger place I‚Äôve eaten at in around in a long long time. Being a Hyderabadi you grow up to your local baker-uncle, then came McDonalds and other brands, which were good, but they didn‚Äôt feel quite homely and you couldn‚Äôt necessarily see the theatrics of your burger in the making. 
GD‚Äôs is a place to go to have a gastronomic experience, not just in terms of the taste but also the theatrics.
The polite owner will always be around asking you about the burger and always taking care of anything the bakers want. 
If you want to be more than just satisfied with your next burger, I suggest you stop by GD‚Äôs. ",5,"2019-03-22 21:00:34",7,175,0
"32615201","An absolute pleasure! Right opposite to Dlf building. The guy makes sure to give your burger the exact time and patience needed to cook it to perfection. A delightful experience!",5,"2019-03-22 19:26:27",3,1,1
"2036154","#DoYouKnow? A burger is the short name but in fact called as Hamburger and if you lay down all the hamburgers eaten my Americans only in a year, it circles earth 32 times.! 
So why Burger topic now? Because of my recent visit to ‚ÄúGD‚Äôs‚Äù  opp DLF that offers quick bites like, sandwiches, hot dog, grilled chicken starters & most importantly their famous mouthful sized burgers. 
Galaxy Burger, no wonder a fast selling pick for its grilled buns crammed with two layered cheesy juicy meat that over salivates your palate.  Grilling bun might need a little tweak to avoid chewiness or I am that one unlucky chap! Followed by brilliant #CometTail hot dog with freshness in every bite and decent smokey #AtomicWings with a sweet-tarty (BBD sauce) finish (but a little over grilled). 
Though many of them choose this place for their speciality Meat burgers they do have good coverage for Egg/Veg‚Äôetarians and heard #AntiMatter burger is a worthy try. Overall paid 480INR.
Value for money yet filling one soul comfortably are the key reasons which can potentially bring you again.

"1635511","Ordered from this place since I was on the lookout for a big fat juicy burger. They didn't disappoint. The Galaxy burger that I ordered was huge. The chicken was grilled properly and tasted fine as well. The only thing I didn't like (I'm a fussy eater) was that the chicken wasn't a breast piece or some sort of filet. It had some loose pieces of fat or skin (which I'm not fond of) and that kinda put me off. A pounded chicken breast without all those ""things"" in between holding the flesh, would have been better. Ultimately I took the burger apart and had the bread and chicken separately. Taste was good though.¬†
Still trying to find a burger that can satisfy me...",3,"2019-03-19 18:32:14",86,646,0

"36387823","Have been hearing a lot about this amazing burger place opposite to DLF, what an amazing join with live grill and freshly made burgers, loved the friendly staff and a uniquely named menu.. ordered Galaxy and milky way burger which were amazing and cooked to perfection, the charcoal grill gives the burger a unique BBQ taste with chunky chicken pieces in it!!
On rush hours the service time can go lengthy, limit parking space the shop shares a juice center which is a plus point to grab some quick fresh juice or soft drink to go with your burger, and is open all night!!
Feels moderately over priced however considering it being surrounded by MNC""s and the taste maybe it's justified, and definitely it's a worth visiting place!",3,"2019-03-03 14:39:56",57,51,2

Chicken piece is enormous than burger, infact when you bite the burger its not the burger which goes into your mouth its the chicken which goes into your mouth first.

GD‚Äôs barbecues and burgers is a small shop located exactly opposite to DLF office here they serve juicy and tender barbecues and burgers.
The burgers made here are really good they marinate the chicken with desi spices and herbs, they cook the chicken in such a way that it is tender and juicy.
This is not a place where you can sit with your friends and have a bite I recommend this place only if you‚Äôre Street food lover and planning to grab something to eat on the go.
Each burger at this place costs around Rs.150-Rs.200.

Three layers of BBQ chicken strips, a cheese slices and some lettuce. It's a nice tasting marinade but if only they didn't over cook it.
You keep the chicken juicy for that's what makes a burger. You'll need someone who understands the timing and temperature to keep the chicken juicy
Constellation
It's more of a mutton sandwich. Again the problem here is of over cooking. The mutton started to crumble while eating and the binding gave way.

"33722272","Ordered cosmic and galaxy burgers from this place, the taste was distinctly different and delicious is an understatement. The chicken was tandoori style and not a patty so that was one new thing. It was juicy, cheesy and the bread was also fresh. This is the first Indianised burger I had and I am in love with it. The galaxy one of too much for one, it is that filling. The cosmic is also same to taste but can be finished by one. The packaging was good and simple, and the burgers were moderately warm when they were delivered. It was a very good experienceüòã please give this place a try.",5,"2018-09-29 23:13:37",118,770,0

edit: I am changing my rating to 5 stars. After talking to them, it seemed that this was an isolated incident of misbehaviour on the part of the delivery guy, and GD was in no way responsible for it.

"311505","Now that s what we call some authentic chicken burger. They can give the big names like burger king and McD run for their money any fine day. These uber tasty charcoal grilled burgers are absolute food nirvana. The soft and tender chicken breast well coated with local desi masala(marinated ) are grilled till they turn golden brown. A double slice of the grilled breast serves as the filling for galactic burger; which is my personal favouriteThe burger buns are soft and sweet.
They have other options too like hotdog and sandwiches which are damn tasty. Basically their USP is the grilling process of marinated chicken breast which makes them uncontested winners of best burgers in cyberabad. The place is in mid of bustling DLF area which makes the place pretty accessible. You may have to be patient enough to catch hold of your burgers as it takes minimum 15 minimum to grill the patty. Must visit place for mouth watering burgers.",5,"2018-09-02 14:11:49",140,929,1
"1366361","A hidden jewel serving probably the best burgers in Hyderabad and that too at a steal of a price.
You probably wouldn't notice this joint infront of DLF Hyderabad but for the crowd that throng during evening hours . And if you have had a burger or a hot dog here and there's simply no place you can go to satisfy the cravings they create .
Do try their cosmic burger, paneer hot dog, paneer burger.
The sauces that they put with the cheese is lipsmacking.
I have been a fan and I'm a regular here. Try and you won't be disappointed.

GD's is a very renowned place famous among people who work in the IT hub and also students in the
same area. You can park your car, and explore this joyous ride. They have burgers like never before, all
named after the galaxy, stars and sky. GD is himself who got these after a lot of research and planned to
ditch his corporate job to start a journey with burgers, why? Because he absolutely loves them. When
you head there, place your order, it takes a min hiimum of 20 minutes for your burgers to arrive as they
prepare all fresh on the live grill in front of you. The burgers are vegetarian, chicken, paneer, fish and
more that is grilled to perfection and topped it with your chosen flavours off the menu. The bread is soft
and straight out of the oven. They also have sandwiches, starters and hotdogs! Try the Mercury, it‚Äôs all
chicken strips with melted Creamy cheese, the perfect burger for a rainy day. The Venus if you are a
lamb fan, or the Milky Way if you love chicken with a lot of Mayo. They also have Neptune, made in
Ferrero nuts, chicken and cheese. There is a special dip you will be served with and it‚Äôs out of the world!",4,"2018-08-24 22:59:39",46,151,0
