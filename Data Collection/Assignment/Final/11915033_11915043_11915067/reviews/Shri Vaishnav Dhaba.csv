"57935083","My brother ordered 4 aloo parathas on #zomato from this place. The food was very homely. I felt like it was ghar ka khana. The pudine ki chutney and tomato curry compliment the Paratha very well. üëå
According to the prices, the food served here is extremely delicious üíØ. üôå
One suggestion : give curd along side, It'd be amazing.üëå ",4,"2019-04-11 01:03:51",37,89,1

Then I disconnected the call and tried to contact zomato service and I was replied with lies , I promise never to use zomato and never visit the restaurant .",1,"2019-03-21 23:26:23",2,7,0

The place is running from a house, where one room is converted to a kitchen and other 2 rooms to sitting area. The ambience is just like that you would find when you visit someone's home for lunch or dinner on some occasion or festivity.
Coming to the food part .... I had ordered dal baati churma. Yes its one of the rare places to get the same in hyderabad. My friend had ordered butter kaju jeera rice and dal tadka. The serving time was pretty decent considering that there was only one person serving and taking order. The taste was also decent, though I had high expectations from dal baati.
Dal baati was nicely fried in ghee and the size also proper. But what faltered was the fact that baati was too hard from outside and not properly done from inside. The serving portion was also 2 nos. and when I expressed my surprise at that, they were generous enough to give one extra at no additional cost.
Kaju jeera rice was decent. I too had high expectations from the same but again faltered. Tadka Dal was really spicy. But in all they were generous to put in decent pieces of kaju (cashew) in the rice.
My suggestion is, if you are looking for having a budget food and and really looking at ambience, then this could be a place.",3,"2019-02-17 08:50:31",59,182,0
"16724635","Good food and better ambience. People can visit this place as it is a budget restaurant with good taste . Different people have different appetite some eat more some eat less  why I am saying this is I have seen few reviews of this restaurant which are baseless and doesn‚Äôt relate . Coming to quantity complaints having seen here at restaurant they charge hardly 100 bucks for starters and curry and just 6 rs for the Roti and curd 10 rs so please guys don‚Äôt complain order double don‚Äôt cry like kid. And also I have seen people just have one follower and in their profile just one review that too for this restaurant only so beware for the restaurant someone is trying to get you down.  And please do not misguide this app this platform is not just to hate to help people for the better food.",4,"2019-02-13 13:49:21",18,89,0

Packaging of the veg combo was very good, thank you for not packing everything in small.pouches(please do same for parathas as well).
