"7801011","This restaurant is highly recommended for home like food. The dal tadka with extra garlic is finger licking, makes me feel like home when I am away from home. Chicken curry combo is so apt and yummy that I always land up order again. Daily having food here is a part of my routine. Budget and taste friendly and makes me feel good.
Again, Highly Recommended restaurant.
PS: Keep up the good work.",5,"2019-03-15 09:48:06",10,75,0

"390963","Dal makhni was ""not"" that typical North Indian one with kaali daal, cream, butter and sweeter version.
The one which I got in the name of dal makhani was a tangy(tomato pieces), kaali dal+rajma, spicier version with almost nil cream, butter and tasted salty
Dal makhni and roti(3 rotis) combo at 99/- still felt a bit expensive for the taste it gave. The packing was good.",2,"2018-12-13 23:48:52",114,530,1

"43542358","This is by far the poorest quality Chicken I have received from a restaurant. The meat was absolutely stale, it had a stench infact which they attempted to cover up with gravy. I have raised a complaint with Zomato and asked for full refund. The food was unfit for consumption so had to be discarded completely.
The verification has been initiated and I hope that you guys will be honest about the meat you are serving. With such disregard towards consumers health, I don't think you should be given a chance to deliver food. ",1,"2018-11-28 13:28:02",10,1,1
