"27308275","One of the worst foods i had till now. I ordered chola jeera rice, they accepted it and later called that it was out of stock. I said to send kadai chicken with jeera rice, they said ok.
Then i spoke to the restaurant owner again to confrim the kadai chicken, he too said that he will take the same, but they ended it up sending me paneer with jeera rice.
I am actually feeling embarrassed to give 2 star for this.
Coming to food, they sent me shahi panner where there were hardly 2-3 pieces and it was filled with capsisum.
Probably they should have called shahi capsicum instead of shahi panner, that would suit perfectly.
I think for name sake they kept as jeera rice instead of white rice, one of the worst jeera rice sorry white rice i evar had in my life.
Dont dare to try the food here.

I recommend people to stay away from this restaurant as my order was never delivered and at last I had to cancel it.
It showed me 60 minutes to deliver and I kept my patience level stable and when it was 10 minutes to deliver I was expecting a call from the delivery executive as they always call for the location guidance.
I texted Zomato to look into the matter and they got in touch with the restaurant and assured me that the food will be delivered in 10-15 minutes.
I kept calm and waited, little did I know that the delivery executive is about to leave the restaurant after 20 minutes and it was already 40 minutes late.
I waited around 1 hour 45 minutes for my order and these people don‚Äôt even care to answer the phone calls, apparently after trying a lot my call was answered by the restaurant and they asked me my last 4 digits of the order number and I provided that and they say sorry sir we don‚Äôt see any order from your side.
It crossed all the limits and I lost my patience.
I suggest the management to take the delivery seriously and deliver on time and answer phone calls.",1,"2018-04-02 09:53:01",57,1011,0
