"73212","One of the WORST CCD'S I've ever visited. From wrong billing to no chicken in the tandoori chicken sandwich, this place is a nightmare. Careless staff, no maintenance of quality. Never coming back. Has changed my perspective about ccd. ",1,"2019-05-03 20:00:50",13,63,0

"30170567","Standard coffee day experience. Ambiance, parking, service is good. Their coffee is standard in taste. My friend had cafe Frappe and felt it is good. Now the bad part is the plain garlic bread and chilli cheese toast. Didn't like both of them. Felt they are not fresh. They are salty and not that hot to eat.",3.5,"2018-02-14 11:15:31",92,726,4

"33167664","I ordered a frappe, a wrap, and a sandwich. the wrap was good. the frappe, on the other hand, was not even average. And that was not even the most disappointing thing. The sandwich that i ordered was nothing more than a scam.  the 'Spinach 'N' Corn Cheese Chipotle Sandwich' was not even stuffed for 1/5 of its length. On one end of the sandwich i could see the stuffing and looked nice but on opening it i saw that the rest of the sandwich was empty. Never have i been more disappointed.",1,"2018-01-15 17:15:48",15,51,0

"29639498","Visited this place in afternoon to have a quick brunch before heading for office. I did not expect much for a brunch here, but I was not disappointed with whatever they had.
It's just that the staff was very less there, and hence service was a bit slow.
Ordered devil's own and kaapi nirvana in cold coffee section. For eatables, ordered roasted chicken and cheese sandwich and grilled chicken wrap.
The taste was exotic.
There was no crowd as it was afternoon. CCD has a better crowd during evenings.
One perfect place to have small meetings with your colleagues or friends over a nice cup of coffee.",4,"2017-06-12 06:13:43",158,228,4

"36495441","Been here for a brunch. We ordered Devil's Own and Kaapi Nirvana from cold coffee delights. For snacks, we chose a Roasted chicken and cheese sandwich along with griilled chicken wrap. 
The food was delicious with the Devil's own being a must-try. Ambience is nice and the outlet is good for chit-chats, meetings and elaborate conversations.

"32884207","i am a coffee lover and have never posted any bad review ever , bt had to cz this was my worst experience ever. 
I was having coffee alone. 
i asked the counter guy for a regular cappuccino along with garlic bread. 
he said single layer chees or double layered. 
i said no cheese. 
then I said wait make the coffee king sized. 
he asked takeaway or having here i said having here. now the results are
a) they automatically made my order takeaway. apparently a alone girl can't have her coffee in the shop?? 
b) he totally forgot to make my coffee king sized. 
c) my garlic bread was double cheese layered. 
moreover the was not even worth all the shit drama. ",1,"2017-02-05 19:25:06",8,8,0

"2020038","Giving it a one star rating is way too much. Me and my sister thought of grabbing some coffee here while we were waiting for our ride back home. My sister who is pregnant was going to have coffee after months so it was a big treat for her. We placed our order for 2 cappucinos and some cheese garlic bread and went over to be seated. The table was dirty so we asked for it to get cleaned. Our server got rid of the used mugs and generously left all the crumbs on the table for us. He then came over with just one cup of cofee and the garlic bread. The cheese garlic bread was too greasy and hardly any traces of cheese. When I asked about the second cup of coffee, we got to know that they took an incomplete order and offcourse hadn't provided the bill for us to review. When he finally got my coffee.. my sister was almost done with hers. I started drinking mine. The coffee wasn't hot.. not warm... it was room temperature and crappy. We told our server about it and he simply listened and walked away. He didn't bother to get a replacement. After waiting for 10 mins he realized we are looking angry and he finally offered another cup. But our mood was killed by then. It was a complete waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. ",1,"2017-01-15 19:57:18",10,83,0

"36116413","Now a days coffee days are growing like mushrooms. Fact is that coffee day is mostly for chi chat. We people mostly visit for chit and have coffee there , 90% people choice is same. 
Coming to my disappoint with coffee day is , I am missing previous taste of coffee . I had coffee in same outlet before 1 year back. 
But in case of snacks they did 100% justice. They added more items in menu. Sizzling brownie will tastes awesome in coffee days. 
Outlet is maintained well , but will be crowded during evenings. Reason behind 😉 is , outlet located backside of ladies hostels.",3.5,"2016-12-18 22:53:16",34,41,2

I have been to this place many times and have tried all their cold coffees. My personal favorites are devil's own and kappi Nirvana. Topical iceberg is too icy, literally. Other food items which I love include chilli cheese toast, egg wrap and big crunch chicken cheese burger.

"1280590","Few years back the cafe coffe day brand was my favourite coffee shop !! But i am witnessing the downfall of it in terms of quality of items provided . I was a big fan of their devils own, recently i had it from this outlet and it sucked big time. It wasnt thick enough as how it used to be . I would get better cold coffees in other places easily now. The only things which i likes there now are belgian choco shots and the sandwiches they give . They should increase the quality of their drinks if they have to stay in business !",2.5,"2016-04-30 19:51:22",86,754,3

"344371","My third time here and my third disappointment! Why does this place stink of bad smell each and every time I visit them? The food is as typical as in any CCD but the only thing I hate about this place is the bad smell and horrible maintenance!
I wanted to grab a quick lunch and opted for a combo of Iced Coffee and Tandoori Paneer Sandwich.
The Ice Coffee was just plain normal, nothing too stellar. As such the coffee was quite dilute and I had to gulp down the coffee real quick so that it doesn't dilute much because of the melting ice. Rating 2.5/5
Tandoori Paneer Sandwich was good though, the bread was super soft and fresh and the filling in the sandwich was well made too. The Tandoori Paneer filling was just rightly spiced and the quantity of the filling was ideal too. Rating 4/5",2,"2015-05-17 18:15:23",104,924,2
