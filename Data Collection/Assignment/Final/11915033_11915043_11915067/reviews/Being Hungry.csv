"50931643","Ordered Paneer Masala Curry and Butter Naan through Zomato. Delivery was quick and packaging was perfect.
Paneer masala was little bit spicy and tasted ok, paneer pieces in curry were less though. Butter Naan was soft, liked it.
Had also tried Chicken Biryani from this place, taste was ok. Biryani rice was flavourful but the rice was little undercooked. ",3,"2019-03-05 07:54:56",74,64,0
"213321","Pocket friendly, sumptuous and decent quality. 
This place is my goto for late night deliveries. Their Kaju Biryani is a personal favorite. 
Well flavoured rice with a generous helping of cashews fried in butter, this one is comfort at its best. 
Their other options are good too and the helping is perfect for two. ",3,"2019-02-11 16:02:00",96,1068,0

"47377852","We went many times along with my office colligues to being hungry. The place was very small and congested. We have ordered chicken lollipop, dry veg munchurian , kaju pulao,egg biryani,chicken biryani, panner biryani, chicken drumsticks,chicken 65. All starters are simply superb.I liked veg munchurian very much.coming to pulao and Biryanies, chicken items are simply superb. But in panner and kaju pulao the masala is very less. I felt like I am eating plain rice. If they would have been added little bit spices it would be great. But after that I have ordered veg munchurian dry many times.",4,"2018-11-18 16:38:16",48,15,0
