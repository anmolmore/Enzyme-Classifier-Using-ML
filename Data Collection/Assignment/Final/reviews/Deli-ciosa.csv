"51865897","I have ordered for a Tiramisu jar which doesn't look like that and also spoilt. The baker has no idea how to make Tiramisu I'm wondering how it's so expensive when all they're giving is egg shells inside it and they didn't even use mascarpone cheese which is the basic ingredient to make Tiramisu instead they used malai(milk cream). I'd never recommend this place to anyone kindly be cautious!!! ",1,"2019-03-15 01:43:07",3,1,0
