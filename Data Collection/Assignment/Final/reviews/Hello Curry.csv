"39843907","The food you serve is good, but the cashier (lady) does not care of the customers. as you are in hospitality market , the first thing you should be thinking of the staff who is facing customer.  She gives arrogant  answers every now and then and ask her to greet customer  with a smile.  Please change her or else your business will fall down.Most of people think same in T-Hub ",1,"2017-12-20 14:14:30",3,1,0
"44338088","Ordered peshawari paneer biryani. Received plain rice mixed with biryani.The taste was so horrible that at the end we have to throw it out.Worst biryani ever. Raita quantity was too less and they didn't even gave complementary gulab jamun. Never order from here.",1,"2017-11-30 14:56:50",12,10,0
"11024381","I have ordered the food from here at midnight and got so late which pissed me off at first and then after seeing their dessert ( Gulab jamun ) . I didn't know how to respond. They gave me a spoiled one ",1,"2017-09-30 04:09:07",4,110,1
"33665373","The word ""Disgusting"" is also a decent word for this restaurant and the service. Start of with, I ordered through Zomato and the food which was delivered to me was stale and Ice cold. I chatted immediately with the Zomato CS and he made me wait over a chat for 1 hr 10 minutes and in the end he didn't have a resolution, asking me to consider this as a one time exception and leave the issue.Â 
Then I spoke to one of the agents as I got a terrible resolution over the chat. The agent over the call assured me that the restaurant will call back within the next 5-7 minutes. There was no call made by the arrogant restaurant and have taken away my money for this order.Â 
Keep that as a tip.Â 
And if you are wondering which order this review is concerned with, the order ID is 35840248.",1,"2017-09-07 00:55:05",33,33,0
"39323176","I did not receive my full order! From mix veg heaven that I ordered, customized with pulav rice, pulav rice was missing. When I asked the delivery guy, he asked me to call restaurant. When I called restaurant, my call is being cut off!! Very bad service. Will never choose this again! ",1,"2017-07-19 18:59:32",1,1,0
"12627481","I ordered Dal Makhni rice combo through swiggy. Â For a quantity of normal rice bowl the given quantity of the Dal is so very less that even a 'cutting chai' will be more. Pathetic quantity and taste. waste of money. WORST!!",1,"2017-07-01 23:24:57",13,1,0
"464081","Hello!Â 
It was a Friday evening and I came back from my work feeling tired. Since I was alone so didn't want to cook as well and hence decided to order from this place. There aren't many restaurants who actually deliver to my area but this one does and after going over the menu, it sounds absolutely perfect for a Friday evening!Â 
Since I am a rice person so I went for chicken tikka curry rice bowl. In this dish, you get what you expect i.e. rice in a plastic bowl and chicken tikka gravy + pieces on top of it. One bowl is sufficient for one person without a doubt.Â 
I also ordered a chicken biriyani which was a disappointment for a simple fact that the price which I paid for the biriyani, I certainly didn't expect to get only 2 pieces of chicken in them? I mean.. what!!Â 
So, stay away from ordering biriyani as it is not a value for money. But for rice bowl which I tried, it was absolutely amazing in terms of taste and quantity.Â 
The delivery was on time.Â 
Will I be ordering again from this place?Â 
Yes, I will be. I would like to try other dishes as well. :-)Â 
Thanks!",3.5,"2017-05-31 22:06:02",132,286,0
"36610530","Fried chicken piece biryani is waste, the chicken is not at all fried it is like dum piece only, and there are only bones , only the biryani rice is good.",1,"2017-05-10 02:06:38",3,1,0
"11880381","Ordered from hello curry on a particular Saturday at office, they gave a pretty neat discount and boy did we over order ! Right from the butter chicken to the rice to the chicken tikka masala. It was definitely fit for atleast 4 hungry souls, and we were just 2 !
The taste was pretty decent actually, though I found the oil to be on the higher side in the gravies, the methi paranthas they sent were cold and too chewy for my liking. That being said, we clearly couldn't even get through 50% of it. It filled our tummies on a budget, and then some more. 
Special mention : The dal makhani was outstanding and definitely amongst the best I've had ! 
Might order again if the discount is there again. ",3.5,"2017-03-14 01:21:23",116,932,5
"15800922","Food is good as I heard from others and my own experience but as far as service is concerned it's poor. The reason being, they are not clear about the quantity of food. We ordered 50 parathas and when the food arrived it was 100 parathas. We thought it's 1 paratha in a package, they didn't brief about the number of parathas on there parathas. It's always good to mention such things, People ordering in bulk may waste a lot of food due to this small issue.",3,"2017-03-11 21:00:48",3,50,0

"3010162","Ordered through swiggy for a light dinner, delivery was very quick and packing was ultimate. Chicken fry piece biryani was very nice, but pieces were suspicious. One piece is real good with nice texture, other one is very hard was not looking yummy, I was not sure why this difference, but overall taste is good. I left the dubious and finished off rest of the biryani.
Gravy given was very good and raitha was thin, as usual.",3.5,"2016-11-21 19:26:49",108,2531,2

"1149669","This review is in regards to chicken biryani orderedFirstly the quantity was absolutely less and had very few chicken pieces (3 precisely) in what was a chicken biryani order. 149 bucks for 3 pieces and such less a quantity
Again I do not want to compare but for the same price there are a lot of restaurants that serve lip smacking biryani and decent chicken piece
Taste was above average
Disappointed 
Might think twice before ordering again",2,"2016-10-14 21:23:04",3,82,0
"7026711","Very much disappointment with the food which we ordered through swiggy.
It was dushera day and we ordered only veg curries .
1st disappointment was unavailability of paneer tikka.
We have ordered paneer Â curry and mixed veg curry and double ka meetha.
Taste wise it was ok but quantity wise very very very less. Not worth of money.
We expected good quantity as the foods are little costlier .
If somebody is thinking to order from here dont expect much from this .

"64345","The name is quiet attractive and that's the reason I first tried the biryani here in the comic con .. I loved the biryani they make.. but I always had one complain with them was that they add too much salt in the food which they serve.. 
They have options for different types of biryani whi his quiet unique and the concept of per gram pricing was also new and quiet fascinating.. 
Altogether a good choice for biryani if the salt is proper :P
Ambience is good.. i like the scooter which is parked outside the outlet... not great furniture comfort wise but an ok choice to hangout with friends.",3.5,"2016-09-07 20:47:43",15,46,0

"20455519","The chicken biryani was beyond what we had at Bawarchi. The chicken is succulent, the rice aromatic and quantity of appetizers sufficient. The delivery is timely. However, their website is slow which leads to increase in waiting time. Order timings are not mentioned on the website and there is no pop-up that reminds you that restaurant is closed even after you place an order.
If you have the patience, must-try for the food. Also order before 11 : 30 pm.",3.5,"2016-08-05 15:56:58",70,90,0

Last night had ordered for home delivery (from Food Panda) for just 3 orders.

And thickshakes were missing.
Quantity of biriyani- too less, food wise- average.

First of all, I am impressed with the packing of the food and they are punctual with home deliveries. The biryani tasted good and is rich in taste, chicken being tender and well-cooked.

"4018421","I have ordered from this place twice now and I think I will order more soon. They were on time and the packing was nice. The first thing you notice when u get the food is the amount of creativeness that has been put into the branding of it. The pictures can give u an idea of the biryani box and the curry boxes. All of them were tightly packed and curry boxes had additional cello tape for protection. The biryani was nice. One may find it bit costly for the amount, but it's filled with rich taste. The rice was perfect, although a bit of aroma was missing. I have tried the blissful butter chicken and the chicken do pyaza from their offerings. Both are distinctly different to taste unlike other small joints. The butter chicken may look pricy but it is not considering the authentic gravy. But I wish the chef had larger chicken pieces in it. That would make it one of the best butter chickens. Last but not the least, even the carry bag, which had the items,  had a funny quotation. ",4,"2016-07-09 01:12:50",26,369,5
"27898797","i'v tried food here many times now. the meal box, chicken tikka biriyani, the stuffed paratas etc.
there are time s you get amazing tasting food and then there are times you repent ordering.
the restaurant should aim to maintain the same quality of food every day.
1st few times i ordered here the food was great. Then one day i ordered dinner for friends and it turned out to be just the wrong day to order. The chicken tikka biriyani was tasting so bad. It was not spoiled the masala mix just tasted bad. and this was difficult for me for me being a super foodie in hyd Â and when i friend from out of town and the order tastes bad. We actually could not even 1 biriyani pack and i had order for four.
The veg finger's is good, cheese parata is good, panner stuffed parata is good, mix veg curry was bad, chicken tikka biriyani tastes good or bad based on you luck, double ka meeta is quite avg.paprikagarden.wordpress.com",3,"2016-07-02 13:26:14",117,526,7

"32089427","Very late delivery time - I waited 1.5 hours for my order to be delivered. Booked the order at 21:03 today. Got confirmation from Zomato that order has been accepted by Hello Curry at the same time. At 22:06 got a call from delivery boy that the order will be delivered within 5 minutes at my gate. Got there, waited for 20 minutes and then got the order at 22:30. On questioning the delivery boy, he said that they got the order at 22:03 (Says so on the receipt). Not sure where the buck stops.",1,"2016-06-23 22:45:27",3,3,1
"1109382","The only best thing is the delivery time. Rest all is simply waste. Thought he food is served hot it doesn't give a good feel to your taste buds. I did order Chicken meal box and I felt MRF tires would be much easy to cut than the chicken which these guys sell. It didn't had any taste at all and any baby can easily eat this meal.
No point in giving rating here.",2,"2016-06-21 11:25:15",44,39,0
"11959561","I must say that this place is better than what I had expected. Staff is cordial and now the most important thing,FOOD.
I was sceptical about the quantity since it came in a box but was more than amazed to find out that the food is enough for two if you are not planning on a very heavy meal.
The jeera rice was good, but that was mostly because of the rice being excellent, could have been a bit better i guess. What really impressed me was the butter chicken. It was perfect and had me licking my spoon. The chicken was succulent and the gravy was just too good.
Overall I would recommend this place for their variety,concept and good food. Worth a try I must say.",4,"2016-06-12 19:42:51",77,416,0
"33555068","This one used to be my first choice earlier when we were ordering through online. There delivery, packing and food was amazing. In recent tubes there has been a dip in quality. Zesty chicken, chettinad chicken and butter chicken were good in curry pots section. Try them with pulav rice. Double ka meeta used to be my favorite dessert earlier but it isn't now.

"32911281","I wanted to try out food from this place for a long time as I was impressed with their Chinese take away boxes and packing during office lunch.
So, on a Sunday afternoon (01/05), we ordered Veg biryani and Andhra Chicken with Methi parantha from Zomato. As mentioned, packing was nice and they gave two spoons as well. Veg biryani was ok with the raitha and mirch salan. We did not like the methi parantha at all as it is actually a laccha parantha and was very hard. It was difficult to chew. Andhra chicken was good but the quantity was pretty less. Overall an average experience.Â

I don't like to discourage  .. but learn to serve proper food - good taste n quality .. BRANDING is secondary ..

"16277929","I had bookmarked this place since very long and now is the time to try out all bookmarked restaurants because I cannot really go out to eat because of my small baby girl. So yet another home delivery experience!
Goods
Steal deal- We got a buy one get one free deal and ordered Kadhai Paneer and Dal Makhni combo..it was very good offer
Packing- I was truly impressed by the packing of the food.. You can check out the pics.
Quantity- I found the gravy (dal and Paneer) were in good portions and sufficient.
Food- Dal Makhni and Paneer were tasting really good..I liked both the things.Paneer had a slight tinge of elaichi flavor with sweet tangy gravy which was going very well with authentic Dal Makhni.
Price-It costed us Only and Only Rs.217 for two items..due to special offer and I would love to order in future if I get such deals. I mean where can you find such food at so low prices.
Lows-
Parantha- The combo we had ordered had two portions of Parantha each. We did not like the parantha at all as it was tasting like frozen one. It was very chewy and hard.
Costly- We were happy as we found the discount very lucrative and were happy to pay that much for the good we are eating. If I had to pay the original prices of the items ordered..it's definitely a costly affair.",3,"2016-04-10 07:58:44",189,2317,4
"1893312","Ordered through food panda from this outlet. We were two and ordered one butter chicken and a chicken biryani. We directly went to the outlet to pickup the delivery as it was nearer from our hostel. When we came back and opened the packets we both felt pissed off after seeing the quantity. They gave us 2 chicken pieces in the butter chicken which costed around 160. The chicken biryani was also very less and was tasteless. I would never suggest anyone to order from this outlet. After spending 400 bucks on this outlet we went out again to eat some quick bites.This startup will also become history if the same continues in the future.

Coming to the food the quality of rice relishers is not up to the mark. Taste is okay but quantity is less. There is shortage of staff there so it takes time to get the order.

The packaging was kinda cute like you get from the Chinese take aways. The veg fingers was indeed crunchy and tasted very well. There was no sauce/chutney with it though. The veg biriyani was a disappointment though. It was plain basmati rice, was very ordinary, and so was the paneer curry.

Firstly there was no cheese in cheesy aloo melts thus no melt in mouth texture it was just mccain potato bites fried. Crunchy veg fingers had to much breading making it less crunchy though it was tastier then the potatoes maybe because of the vegetable stuffing. I was expecting it to be accompanied by some dip other than ketchup but I got only ketchup. Packaging was good though might just try the curries next time but never having the quick bites again.",2,"2015-07-25 13:47:59",34,56,2
"15049801","I had ordered their chicken dum biryani regular for lunch through food panda. The delivery was prompt and the biryani smelt yummy. The package was very pleasing and compact, reminds me of the chinese take aways. 
Everything nice to see and smell, but the taste of biryani is simply mediocre. I was expecting a lot more, considering it is not priced too cheap. When in hyderabad, I expect a certain amount of quality in the biryanis, this place does not come even close to anywhere with the taste.
Considering I did not have high expectations, could just live with the taste of it. With so many biryani points cropping up in the area, I doubt I will ever recommend this place again.",2.5,"2015-07-18 15:28:03",21,72,0
"1546841","Ordered from them through Foodpanda. Having been to the Madhapur outlet once, I sorta knew what to expect from them. Though I am a fan of the brand that they are trying to build with HelloCurry, they have some big problems in the taste department. The packaging is excellent, food is delivered on time and at a good temperature, but the food is low quality and doesn't make you feel anything close to the warmth you feel when you order from dhabas that serve no fuss food at affordable prices.Â 
On this particular day, we ordered Paneer Pops for apetizer and a Vegetable Biryani for mains. It was a typical weekday dinner order, which seems like their major scenario. The delivery experience was smooth with FoodPanda and the delivery was made on time in pretty looking color pop packaging. The Paneer Pops dish was a super duper disappointment and looked nothing like the Paneer dish shown in the menu next to its name. It was Paneer fried in batter that was soggy and lacked flavor of any kind. Biryani was saving grace. It smelled good and the condiments were great but left us wanting for more veggies and masala and love in it.Â 
Though prices are reasonable here, thank God FoodPanda gave us 50% off on the order since it was booked via the app. That saved the day for us but the dinner was disappointing to say the least. I will give it just one more chance and order more smartly next time, just because I liked the ease of ordering, the delivery and the packaging.",2.5,"2015-07-14 01:08:19",44,233,0

"1776353","We had the Veg. Biryani and the Paneer Makhani pot with Malabar Parantha.
I found the food extremely average. They use a lot of Garam Masala and Chilly which takes you away from the flavour of the food.
It is a self service restaurant and the seating place is just fine. The good thing is that it is very easy on the pocket, so 1 person can eat lunch for about 250 ehich includes your meal and a drink.

I prefer the Chicken Tikka Biryani over the Chicken Dum Biryani because the pieces of meat in the former are better and more succulent. Moreover, I find the Chicken Dum Biryani to be exceptionally dry. The Mutton Biryani is also quite commendable. However, the number of mutton pieces in the biryani are few and far between when compared to the chicken variants.

Hope we see revised menu soon. Else until u close down, i am sure i will order from u guys... Good Luck.",3.5,"2014-12-26 17:29:43",19,117,0
"15363111","The most pathetic place to order food from... I ordered a biryani but it never arrived, even after 1.5 hours of ordering it !Â  And they had promised a delivery time of 55 minutes to begin with...On top of that, the manager is making excuses saying we are busy instead of apologizing...I am never ordering from this place again...",1,"2014-12-07 15:46:21",1,0,0
"1903332","The worst place I ever ordered food from. I had to wait 2 hrs and even then I didn't receive my food. I called them every at 1 hr , 1 1/2 and then at 2 hrs. I never got any update on the order and I didn't even receive an apology from the staff. I am never gonna order from this place again. The only reason this place has got 1 star is that I can't give negative rating. ",1,"2014-11-24 22:06:14",2,0,0

We have ordered royal paneer makhani and lacha parata,kadai paneer,jeera rice,veg biryani,mutton biryani,double ka meetha.
Every thing tasted bland and paneer makhani is very bad it's not even edible.Jeera rice and kadai paneer is yum!!!
double ka meetha is the star with cream on top of it..it is so tasty...
Over all quantity is good,packing is awesome. :)",3.5,"2014-11-08 14:59:01",29,239,0
