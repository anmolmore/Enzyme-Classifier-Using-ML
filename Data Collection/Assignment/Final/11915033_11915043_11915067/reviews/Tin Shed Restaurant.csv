Both the quality and quantity was good. Taste was ok. So my rating is 4 star here. Will definately go again and try some other items .
Recommended for Chinese fast food lovers.",4,"2018-10-18 00:33:18",25,978,4
"37271791","Drop in to this place with foodie friends for dinner. Ambience was cozy . Its not like a restaurant for dining out.
We ordered Veg alfredo pasta and chicken kababs. Both were the show stealer. It was one of the best starter i had there.It was cooked perfectly and each bite was melting in mouth. That was just awesome and perfect for dinner.
Kabab was spicy,tangy and each bite was favorful. Creamy pasta was just delicious and i can say better than chocolate room.
My overall experience was really good.",4,"2018-09-14 18:36:00",33,42,2

"35769955","I ordered Cheese Tomato curry. I waited for almost 45mins and got my order. And then in excitement I opened the box of curry. But what I saw in the box killed my excitement as it was not curry I ordered.
This was not at all a good experience for me.
I think the Zomato and the restaurants must understand that we wait for the food in so much of anticipation and excitement, we atleast deserve rights to expect the item for which we paid. And it's not about the money or the payment we have already done, it's about the TIME we waited and the anticipation, excitement with which we were waiting.
And if we don't get the desired item, it kills the mood, hunger and everything seems irritating.
Now since I got the refund of my money, I want to know how is zomato and the restaurant planning to refund me for killing my TIME, Anticipations and above all my HUNGER...?",1,"2018-07-22 21:18:00",22,67,0

All the curries taste differently well. Some of the suggested items to try are - stuffed aloo, Achari chicken, chicken tikka masala, veg manchurian, tomato soup, Rada chicken. 
Tin shed is totally worth ordering daily from. ",5,"2018-04-23 12:42:53",3,99,0
