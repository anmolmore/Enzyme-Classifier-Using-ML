Coming to the main reason.. It didn't dissapoint us.. Mutton Haleem was amazing.. Enriched with Pure ghee and dry fruits. ",4,"2019-05-18 09:14:43",187,2856,0

"3325631","I am a vegetarian but I went to Pakwaan Grand with my family(Non-veg) as per reference of my colleague.
Ordered few Kababs, Biriyani, Nan, Panner 
Value for money.
Quantity is good.
Taste : We specifically told the manager to server less spicy items and my parents really liked the kabab items and a chicken main course.
Service : That time I think only 4-5 table filled. But they are very late in serving and the waiter even not listening after a multiple time about serving (e.g veg  or non-veg. No rice to parent). He just did what he thought. Then I started to serve till manger came for rescue..ha ha... 1 star less for this. In one word it's un-professionalism.
Service time : Good, timely delivered the ordered items.

"402259","I and my colleague missed our lunch due to the work load and was craving for something tasty. It was 3 in the noon and we planned to order some curry and started since both of us brought mains from home. Hence, we wanted to try something we haven't had before, and zeroed on Pakwaan Grand. 
Checked out the menu and found Chicken Afghani, Pepper chicken to be their favorites. Ordered these, though ZOMATO, however, ZOMATO RUINED IT with delivery part the food was worth the wait.
The Chicken Afghani was spicy and went well with steamed rice. The pepper chicken was bit over fried, however, tasty with right blend of species. 
The gravy was unique because i had Chicken Afghani in other restaurants but Pakwaan has their own way of presenting it. 
Overall it was a wholesome meal for 2 of us.

It was a plain rice with Butter Paneer Masala at the end, seriously I was shocked when I opened the package.
Last time, I ordered 'Veg Biryani' which was also just accpetable.
So, from my past experience food from this place is totally non-recommendable, specially for vegiterians.

It was around 11 pm that i started craving for mutton biryani. So i went ahead and ordered a Mini Mutton Biryani pack and to my surprise this mini pack tasted sooo good that doing little by little i ate more than i actually wanted too. A must try biryani which came with 4-5 medium sized mutton, nice masala and really good quantity. This can surely be served for 2 people. Have also tried their mini chicken biryani which comes with one big chicken leg piece. Compartively less spicey than mutton one. When you get tasty food at just Rs 110.
