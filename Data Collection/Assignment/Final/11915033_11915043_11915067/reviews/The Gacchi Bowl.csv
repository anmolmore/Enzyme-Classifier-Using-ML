I have ordered spicy fry piece biryani from here.. The spice levels as mentioned are good and made me sweat in happiness.. 😄
The packaging is nicely done.. the quantity should be enough for 2 people with close to 8 medium sized pieces of chicken.. The flavor could be a little better though.. 👍",3,"2019-05-03 13:46:40",200,389,2

Try 1. Lemon 🍋  chicken 🍗. The quantity will be enough for two as a starter. Delicious too. Nicely presented with couple of lemon 🍋 slices over it. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.5
Try 2. Chicken 🍗 biriyani. This was a little bit on the spicer side 🌶🌶🌶🌶. Quantity will be not be enough for two people. ⭐️⭐️⭐️.5

Telangana chicken curry and biryani.. the biryani I had here was amazing and I couldn't decide which one I liked more.. the kebab or the biryani.. finger licking good...
The biryani is well cooked and has a consistent taste till the last spoon. The quantity was very very healthy.
Please maintain this quality and quantity of the biryani..",5,"2019-03-02 17:09:22",4,2,1
"31407487","As mentioned by a few people, the packaging is very good.
Food Taste: Food was impressive, especially Punjabi Chicken (Curry) if you like the dhaba style chicken.
Chicken Tikka was fresh & succulent, and the best one to me was Krackjack Chicken (Must Try)",5,"2019-02-23 09:10:58",1,4,0
"39137427","I was badly craving for Dal Makhani...so, I open zomato app and found this new place and thought to give a try..order delivery was quick and food was hot ☺
I ordered Dal Makhani and zeera rice..zeera rice was Flavorful and aromatic..The spices were giving ordinary hit to the dish..
While Dal Makhani was not up to my expectations..It was more like Dal fry..Dal makhani should be light and Creamy but here it was more like mix Dal..and taste wise also it was ok..

"45973564","I orded a Biryaani from here today.. It was chicken dum Biryaani
On packaging I can give it 3.5/5 star it was proper.
Now coming on the taste ... I will sincerely ask the restaurant management please taste it.. And let me know if you find any taste in it.. Biryaani is all about flavor and all I can taste is white rice which was I think from leftover it was very hard and dried out... Even the chicken was not properly cooked in dum.. The masala that holds the chicken was even taste raw.. And uncooked.
I was gonna complained about the quantity which we get in 300 bucks but thank god it was not that much... We would have to through it out.. Cuz the things is I don't like to waste food.
Please do taste your Biryaani... And improve.
Best wishes",1,"2019-02-10 15:31:40",1,1,0
