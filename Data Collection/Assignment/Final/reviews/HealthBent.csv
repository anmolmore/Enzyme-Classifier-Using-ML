"42937555","Delicious food at very minimal price. I like it :)
Best part is that it gives you an option to choose between rice and chapati and also provide multigrain chapati ",4,"2019-05-18 15:46:50",1,7,0
"45249424","HealthBent is supposed to serve recipes which are delicious and healthy at the same time. I ordered Paneer and Dal Makhni Meal and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The outlet is budget friendly, serves healthy food and the food is really tasty. Aur kya chahiye?",4,"2019-05-05 18:23:47",7,5,0
"15390331","Health Bent stands to its name. We had ordered the Tomato Pappu(5/5) and Bendkaya masala (5/5) meal box. It was amazing and I would order again to try the other stuff that they have. The food they prepare looks and feels very healthy. On separate occasions we have ordered the Bihari Mutton curry (5/5) and Aloo Chokha(4/4) meal box. Also the Chicken Chettinad meal (5/5) was amazing. I am now a regular here and you should try their offerings too. Cheers!",5,"2019-05-05 00:15:48",207,400,0
"32282161","Wow! The foods great! The packaging is great, keeping in mind the environmental impact the box was wrapped in jute bag. Coming to the taste, i ordered chicken breast bowl and it was so tender, juicy and tasty. Keep up the good work! I would definitely recommend it for health conscious folk.",5,"2019-05-03 13:31:44",9,8,0
"27725380","Ordered baingan bharta, rajma combo and aloo posta moong daal combo
Quality- quality wise the food was good not very good but good, baingan bharta, rajma daal were good but aloo posto was very tasteless may it is supposed to be like that no idea 4/5
Quantity- It was ok ok may be I eat more so I didn't find it enough for 1 person may b 1-2 extra roti is required but they don't sell roti/rice separately.The size of roti is very small and thin
Value for money-3/5
Packaging-5/5
Delivery-5/5",3,"2019-04-16 20:05:42",59,40,2
"32497477","Ordered the plantain kofta curry meal and it had way too much salt. It always had extra salt every time I ordered but still used to be eatable. Today's curry was horrible. Tried calling the restaurant but they never answer, neither do they take any note of cooking instructions. Being a restaurant offering healthy food, I feel they should consider the quantity of ingredients! Even places with not so good rating do not put excess salt in anything!

"45578961","I have ordered many a times from here and their smoked baigan himachali bharta combo is my favourite. It is really very tasty and best North Indian dish I had in Hyderabad. One thing they should improve is red chilli as it has too much. Overall food is tasty with multigrain roti options.",4,"2019-04-01 01:10:41",10,10,0
"52137531","Delivery Review
Initially ordered a grilled chicken best meal, the taste was good. The Dalia was tangy, the veggies accompanied well and just the way I prefer them. The chicken was also tender but the quantity was so less that one side of the box was covered with a just a thin layer.
I had to complain and the store manager/owner listened patiently and agreed to it that they had less quantity left for that meal.
To make up for it he sent me a Baingan Bhartha meal and let me tell you I haven't had such amazing meal in the past few days.
The rotis were soft and Baingan bhartha felt like the one made at home by mom.
Would definitely recommend this place to all",4,"2019-03-31 17:30:23",84,368,2
"1635511","Ordered from here instead of Eat.Fit. Their menus are pretty similar. Food was delivered quickly to my location. It was delivered piping hot, so that's a plus. I ordered the grilled chicken breast meal. It was mildly flavored, the chicken pieces were sumptuous. The dish overall is quite filling. Great value for money. Packaging was nice too!",5,"2019-03-25 21:24:42",86,646,0
"2227096","Recently ordered from this place and was amazed to see the neat packaging, homelike flavour and value for money food. Ordered Bihari Mitton curry meal and Lauki Dal meal. 1 star less because I didn't recieve Lauki dal meal and got something else but it tasted nice as well. Will again order to try other options.

"34988637","Food was good ,tastes like home made food ,I ordered mutton and I liked but healthy food makes sense when they provide details like calorie , which oil used,protein ,carbs and fats breakdown then it will rock defnetialy.",4,"2019-03-09 20:22:02",4,1,0
"1361105","I tried the grilled tilapia,chimichurri sauce,bell pepper, quinoa. Taste wise it is good. The fish and vegetables were well cooked¬† However, the food appeared a bit greasy and not inline with being healthy. Not sure about other dishes though fromthis place. Quantity could have been better.",3,"2019-03-04 12:11:57",42,152,0
"48257693","Just loved meal from this place. Light and nutritions and apt for those who are looking for something light weight. I have tried tofu meal, smoked beganbharta meal and plantain kofta meal. Among them tofu meal is my favorite. It contains baked tofu pieces,bboiled veggies and spaghetti with sprouts. It tastes really good. And the other two tastes average but well cooked and smoked beganbharta meal is served with brown rice which is a plus ! Good packaging and reasonable prices.atoneplaceonline.com",5,"2019-03-01 16:06:31",85,190,2
"34774600","Ordered Soy Glazed Basa. The fish was good, although I expected it to be covered with Soy sauce, but over all the dish was good. Quantity of noodles was a bit less. There were three big chunks of Basa fish. Babycorn and carrot were the veggies. ",4,"2019-02-24 15:03:08",22,161,1
"34403078","Seeing good reviews on Zomato for their homemade taste, I opted for the basic Tomato Pappu-Bendakaya Meal.
First thing which impressed me was their neat packing. There was a small sachet with Fork-Spoon neatly wrapped in tissues.
The Box was well packed. Long Grain Basmati was used as rice, which was very tasty. Multigrain pulkas were super soft and thin.
Quantity of Tomato Pappu and Bendakaya Tomato Dry curry were sufficient. Bendakaya was perfect in taste. Dal was good but spices can be increased.
Kokum Lime Sharbat with Basil seeds was a nice cooler. ",4,"2019-02-22 00:22:32",91,177,2
"37242332","Food &Taste: 3.0/5
Sambar rice was very tasty but quantity received was very less. Its just 6 spoons.
Gongura chicken was not tasty at all.No flavours except rawness of leaves. Beetroot chutney was tasty.",3,"2019-02-19 18:43:44",10,4,1
"260322","The bendakaya, pappu, rice and multigrain phulka meal was very nice and would have had given it a rating of 4 but the Tofu in chili soy sauce and udon noodles bowl was just awful and therefore it's an overall 3 star. The Tofu bowl was too dry and there was no hint of sauce it in. The udon noodles were bland without any flavor of garlic. The broccoli, carrots and babycorn in it was almost raw. The portion size was meagre for the price. ",3,"2019-02-19 17:05:41",55,199,0
"1556109","Ordered the Smoked Baingan Bharta combo and I must say they delivered healthy food and how. Baingan bharta was perfect and rajma was also quite good. Multigrain rotis were so soft, it reminded me of my mom‚Äôs rotis (thumbs up for that). Quantity of rice is also decent. All in all it‚Äôs pretty good food at decent price. Eat fit needs to learn roti making from these guys. üê∑likes !!",4,"2019-02-18 14:32:09",20,17,0
"2296704","One of the best things that happened to me in my recent trip to Hyderabad is 'HealthBent'. Located at the heart of the IT parks makes it an easily accessible place for our troop.
We ordered multiple items and everything we had were awesome which happens quite rare. I had parotta with Smoked Baingan barta and Plantain kofta. The parotta was made with multi grain flour and still was tasty and trust me I am not a fan of brinjal but still I fell in love with this smoky flavoured Baingan barta. I can give this combo a 6/5 and plantain kofta can't be rated low too.
Later I had roti (multigrain flour) with lean butter paneer and rice with rajma masala. Oh man trust me you can never get a healthier butter paneer with such a great taste. The gravy was so light and you feel no sin in having a bowlful of this gravy too. This is again a 6/5 combination. Out of the whole lot Rajma Masala and rice was the only thing which is a 5/5 whereas rest all are something which you can't expect. I am not rating this combination low but this is something which is not out of the box but still tastes great.
The packaging was good and the delivery was on time.
Trust me if they retain the same quality and taste these guys can go places. Hope they can do it. Apologies for not posting pictures of the food and it's not my mistake because HeathBent made me indulge in the food and forget everything else.

"37717465","Hands down HealthBent is the best in Hyderabad when it comes to healthy, homely food. I am so glad I found this place! I had lean butter chicken meal and smoked baingan bharta meal.
The rotis that they provide are made with multigrain flour and you can tell when you see the rotis. Plus, they know the art of making brown rice :) I generally don't like brown rice because it feels weird when I chew. But they have got it right!
Lean butter chicken was not that tasty but the daalmakhni, smoked baingan, and the rajma were amazing.
In the smoked baingan bharta meal, they gave a piece of atte ka halwa (if m not wrong), which didn't do much for my tastebuds. I wish they had given onions/cucumbers instead of the halwa.
Verdict - I LOVE it! And I wish them luck. Hope they will continue making healthy, tasty, and reasonably priced food :)",5,"2019-01-21 21:58:10",42,1379,1
