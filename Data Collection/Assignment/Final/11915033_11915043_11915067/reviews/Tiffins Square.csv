"2977466","This nice sports cum restaurant outlet was nearby the place where I was staying in Gachibowli. Just walked out there on a weekday evening. Found it to be almost empty. They have both AC sitting & normal on the terrace.  The Menu of all the outlets in the place are displayed. 
I chose Tiffins square for their south indian tiffin varieties on offer. Ordered for the Chicken Parotta hoping it to be like a TN style parotta. It exceeded my expectation I can say. The layered parotta was topped with beaten eggs spread around like an omelette on top.  The taste was amazing with the parotta being really fluffy and crispy. The Chicken Korma accompanying it was brilliant as well though it was very spicy. The best thing about it was the getti chutney (term for Thick Coconut Chutney used in Tamil Nadu) served along with it. I loved the taste of it and never tried getti chutney before with Parotta. 
One thing which I did not like was their lack of normal water. I was forced to shell out for a bottled water which I would have avoided it normally.  Also, the cost was a bit pricey for a Chicken Parotta which I would have had it in half of its cost in TN.",4,"2018-12-04 00:31:29",119,469,1

We have been there yesterday. This place has volleyball court n few others.
Ambiance is fine. Do have outdoor n indoor sitting.
We have ordered couple of breakfast items. All the items are good. I personally like Chittori chicken Idli.
Staff is not well trained and they need more staff to cover the crowd.

Tried their T2 square dosa with chicken pulusu which the curry was pretty average but the dosa was decent. Overall an average affair.",3,"2018-08-20 20:59:05",1031,1653,0
