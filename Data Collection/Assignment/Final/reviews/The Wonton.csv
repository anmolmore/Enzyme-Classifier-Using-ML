"88152071","Very bad experience....we ordered veg pad Thai and Thai green curry....pad Thai noodles usually will be rice noodles but here they made it with Singapore noodles....taste is very bad...we have asked them for the peanut flavor which is missing...they added crushed peanuts not even powder and served...simply it is like hakka noodles with peanuts. I gave that one star only for the staff....",1,"2019-05-06 01:05:12",1,0,0
"52067873","Horrible place. Noodles, dumplings and manchurian were not at all good. Noodles were completely plain no salt no spice. Manchurians were hard to eat. I will never recommend.",1,"2019-04-24 01:28:13",9,2,0
"1226217","My sister wanted to try all the places which have thai curry in hyderabad, so this was on the list.. We went for dinner..its in that famous food lane in Gachibowli. Parking is a huge problem! We parked very far and walked which felt good after eating!
Ambience was not great typical Chinese Restaurant..no dinners to our surprise except swiggy and zomato delvery guys..manager was very humbel. He received us good. Menu was huge and bit confusing..so he sujested what to take
We ordered thai green curry and thai red curry, phukat fish, chiken wonton, crispy honey potato for desert fried ice-cream.
Phukat fish was the star the sauces were yummy , wonton was not that great, honey potato is good.
Now thai currys both of them were served with rice..normal rice!
The curry had good flavour to it but they were not cremy as we expected..
Fried ice cream was good topped with coconut and honey.. Asian flavours!
the place was empty on a Saturday night! not going again! May be we will try their other branch! ",3,"2019-04-06 13:12:03",29,66,4
"3203004","Alright, so I went there with a friend on a saturday in the afternoon hours. The staff was sleeping, the waitress was still in sleep and could not understand half of the things we were saying. Also I realized that there is no thukpa in this branch (HiTech city has) and I come here mostly for thukpa. Yes it was a waste of some time, but the food was as good as expected from Wonton. But, sadly I‚Äôll prefer the Hitech City branch for my further relationship. ",3,"2019-03-31 10:41:12",109,893,0
"57398630","Stay away from the kung pao chicken. Bland, unappetizing, underwhelming are all an understatement. The description says burnt chillies, cashew and celery... Really? Was the celery hiding in shame or was it pulverized in the sauce along with all the cashews?? Oh maybe they just drowned in your gooey water called sauce. Btw who serves Chinese without a side of rice???",1,"2019-03-25 21:36:15",6,1,1

"50071238","This place was in my list as it was suggested to be great by a few of my friends.
I was clearly disappointed for the food. Maybe it was not the best day to visit but the chef has made everything extra saucy. It's not my preference of Chinese.
Also everything tasted the same. I've had better chicken lollipops in Hyderabad.
Would try again sometime to be assured if this place would work üòå",3,"2019-03-11 03:10:18",19,53,0

"30359317","This is the place where you get the best Chinese food in Hyderabad also at a bit reasonable cost.
One should try the Pan fried Noodles here.
Been with my bestie who studied in China many number of times.
Bit prior knowledge of Chinese food and menu will be an added advantage if you fully want to immerse in the Chinese cuisine experience.

"2698588","Chinese Theme Restaurant-
Ambiance-
The Wonton is Chinese Theme Restaurant having 2 outlets in Hyderabad. We visited to one of it's outlet located at Gachibowli. A perfectly decorated restaurant has indoor sitting arrangement including couch and chairs and having beautiful entrance, but low light.
Food-
The Wonton serves a large variety of Chinese dishes and beverages. We placed an order for Chicken lollipop which has 6 large chicken lollipop pieces, served with Schezwan Chutney and cost approximately INR 280. We also placed an order for Sea Food Soft Noodles, which was fully loaded with prawns cost approximately INR 290 and tasted perfect. The Wonton offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-

"71949522","Extremely disappointed with this place. Ordered a nasi goreng and got an extremely normal over priced fried rice instead. When asked about this, the waiter said this is how nasi goreng is prepared here. Nasi goreng is a standard preparation. You cannot just make ordinary fried rice and label it nasi goreng in your menu.

Also heard a mouse running around over the false ceiling.",1,"2018-12-22 22:41:05",1,0,0

Ambiance was a bit gloomy ,the place doesn't feel lively.
We have ordered wonton soup ,at first ,the piece felt like a üê∏ in my mouth, but the soup part tasted better.
Next comes the chicken wings,chicken wonton fried rice ,it was good too ,but the portion size was small for that price .
Overall it was an average experience ",3,"2018-12-21 12:53:40",5,1,0

But mind it guys you need use the Zomato Gold coupon before 10:30pm, else it's not applicable in the restaurant. The staff won't accept the coupon code beyond 10:30pm. I personally found it bit confusing but their policy. Well the place is dimly lit and if you're looking for some fancy place then no it's not like that. Service is good. Let's talk about the food now. I had ordered butter prawns and thai curry. The taste was heavenly. Perfect. I will request the restaurant management to put some effort on the lighting and ambience.

"34884988","Since long time, I had a craving to have Chinese food but ended up with great disappointment. Only foodie people can understand such a frustrating feeling.
Not only the food was below average but service too. We asked Saroj - the manager, about the best items in their menu. The answer was everything. They are specialists in all the items.. Okay..!!! so we ordered hakka noodles and Thai pineapple rice. Quantity was enough. But both of them, nowhere even near the expectations. Noodles was still eatable, but the rice was totally bland. We asked for red chilli sauce and the waiter took out frozen green chutney. He didn't know what is chilli sauce.. Didn't expect such kind of food and service from a renowned restaurant like Wonton..

Hanoi Soup - Here in wonton it is same like any other thick soup, nothing spl about it..
Dragon chilli mushroom.. This is too good.. Crunchy, Sweet, Sour, Spicy and so tasty..
Eng young faan - Egg fried rice topped with a thick chicken soup.. I has just got a subtle flavor to it.. as they served in a plate it got cold for the 2nd serving..
Spinach and mushroom fried rice - I did not eat it, but heard that it is bland.. My friend had to add loads of sauces to make it better.. I cannot comment more on it.
Must try - Dragon chilli mushroom, for sure
Say nah to the rest..
Don't expect a great service from the staff and cutlery is not so clean.. had to get it changed..
Total cost is 708, after excluding one of the items as we availed Zomato gold",3,"2018-11-03 14:04:27",7,475,4
"56522618","The food was okay.The staff was rude,impolite,oversmart.
The manager-head of waiters- was discourteous.
Would you handle the situation delicately when there no water supply in your restaurant's washroom? This genius says-use water from bucket(as if he is doing a favour).
The waiters openly ask ""should I adjust the tip"" ? Tip is earned , it is not demanded.
How dare you ask for tips ? Maybe they knew the experience was memorable.
Overall ,this suffocating place left a bad taste in mouth.
Wasted quality time with family by going here.",1,"2018-11-03 03:37:04",5,2,0

"1282457","By reading the reviews I expected that this would be a underrated pocket friendly restaurant. But in reality this restaurant is overrated. We ordered two veg starters and a non veg starter. Veg starters were okay but the non veg starter was not so good. In the main course we ordered a fish steak with schezwan sauce, the fish was so stinky and it was undercooked. When we asked the manager he told us that it was undercooked but in reality it was spoiled fish meat as the smell was so different and stinky.

"50303984","Chinese food always has a special place in my heart. But it was quite a disappointing experience when I visited The Wonton in Gachibowli.
My tongue craved for a good Chinese cuisine and one of my colleagues suggested that we go here.
Located amidst the busy road in Gachibowli, it looked like an old building with a creaky staircase. As we entered, there was a foul stench which was really unwelcome. The place that we were given was stinking. Unsure about this, we shifted places and the staff were courteous to spray some room freshener around.
The order was placed. The Lemon soda that was ordered had fizzed out before coming to the table. Manchow soup and Honey chilli potato were decent but was totally disappointed with the main course. We had Crispy Schezwan Noodles and Chilli Garlic noodles with a hunan sauce based vegetable gravy. The gravy was more like Sambhar with some chilli sauce in it. The gravy that was poured on the crisp noodles was bland and didn't taste good in my mouth.
The 2 stars are for the courteous staff and not for the food.
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a good Chinese food that tickles your tongue and makes you crave more for it.",2,"2018-09-29 17:19:33",8,259,5

"504887","Visited this place on 27th August, 2018 at around 10:30pm and once upon a favourite place turned to not so favourite. I will not be going here again and wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone else either. We ordered two veg clear soup spicy and two non spicy. The order was served 15mins later. When we started having the soup in mid of it we were told the wrong order was served to us and that they‚Äôll get the correct one. Mid way we had to stop having the soup as it was taken away. We had a 4 year old with us and as it was already getting late, we ordered normal chicken fried rice and soft noodles. Nothing fancy as we thought it may take them time. Surprisingly, It took them over 25-30mins to even give us a status update on what was happening with our order. When we asked the person taking the order, he said that the waiter while trying to get the order, dropped it on the floor and they‚Äôre having to remake it. We finally got the friend rice after 30 minutes, this time noodles missing. By then our appetite was almost killed. We almost finished the fired rice and they got us noodles. We asked them to take it back as it was too late and the kid had slept. The counter server threw us a dirty look when we asked him to cancel the noodles and when we tried to reason and tell him he stopped us midway and returned. Very poor experience. Never had such an experience before at this place and I used to absolutely love the food here. The counter server needs to really be coached as he is front facing the customer.

"2350674","Visited the place twice, both on weekends. Not much crowded, with a quite and soothing ambience.
In starters, we had fried chicken wonton which were nice and crispy with tender chicken, chicken dumplings were steamed well with sufficient stuffing and tasted ok and dragon chicken which had typical tangy taste with cashews and well cooked chicken.
For main course, shanghai pan fried noodles tasted great with just the appropriate frying of noodles and a tangy gravy full of small chicken pieces which tasted good and chicken fried rice which were cooked well but were neither too spicy not too plain, was ok.
The quantity is sufficient and probably once main course and one starter is sufficient to fill up two people.",4,"2018-08-29 00:09:36",21,132,0
"36352354","Visited The Wonton earlier this month on a weekday afternoon.
The stairs were untidy and creepy(that day).

"677679","Wandering in the street of Indira Nagar , we were looking for a good place where we can have good dinner.
Our eyes glanced through Wonton and we immediately decided to visit this place to have some authentic Chinese.
The ambience was dull and the AC wasn't working, there was no music as well.
The staff was courteous and they took our order.
Manchow soup was one of the finest that I have had till date.
Vegetable chilli garlic noodles were also one of the finest that I have had, we totally loved it.
The thing which disappointed us was their extremely slow service. They took around 40 mins to bring noodles. We raised it to the Captain and he mentioned that half of the staff is working for a party in the nearby banquet.
In my view, it wasn't valid as you are still charging the same to the customers but the waiting time has doubled.
Still considering it as an exception and the awesome quality of food, I rate this place as 4 stars and would recommend it to people who want to have Good Chinese food. ",4,"2018-08-27 10:26:49",328,1858,0

"719520","I visited this place after 4 years. Thought of trying some chinese food. But the experience was not that great. I have 2 zomato gold passes. So we ordered prawn starter, fried fish and 2 spicy soups. Soup was good. Bit spicy and some veggies. Well balanced. Now coming to starters prawn starter was not good. Fish was also kind of ok.
In main course we ordered one mix nonveg schezwan noodles and one mix nonveg chinese chopsuey. Quantity was good on both the portion. Schezwan noodles was good but it was too much oily. Chinese chopsuey was too much salty and was not at all edible. When we told the management about it they simply brought half glass of sweet and salt lime soda for us.
Coming to ambiance its not that great. And toilets were also dirty, smelly and unhygienic.

"37367111","I have been dining at Wonton Gachibowli since 2014 and always appreciated the quality, quantity and taste of food. Today for the first time I got a shocker, did take-away as my family did not want to step out in the bad weather and when I opened up the main course (rice and noodles) boxes I found that quantity is almost 60% of what they serve if you dine there. They charged me for the 100% though. It's too bad that after so many years of trust, I have to cut off Wonton as my go-to Chinese Restaurant and look out for a new place.

We packed food from here. The menu cards are worn out. It must have been a good place once upon a time. You see wear and tear. The seating is good. There was nobody in the restaurant when we entered at 12:30 PM. We saw many swiggy and Zomato delivery lads. We ordered dim sums, rolls and paneer for starters. Garlic noodles for main course. Food was tasty. It is not very expensive at about ‚Çπ400 per person. I will order on Zomato next time. Glimpses of the kitchen indicated a need for cleanliness.",3,"2018-07-21 21:38:33",61,1188,3
"1071070","Chinese cuisine does not please my taste buds.. but as were a little bored of eating biryani all the time, we went to Wonton to try..
The ambiance was not good.. there was a distinct uncomfortable smell pervading in the seating area.. we chose to sit towards the road and sadly there were cockroaches under the tables.. :-|¬†
it was already late so we could not leave the restro at that time..
We ordered chilly potato, crispy corn, chilly chicken and Khao Pahd(some fried rice).. crispy corn had great texture.. crispy and the taste was nice.. chilly potato was decent..¬†
Chilly chicken and the fried rice were really bad.. the chicken was not fresh.. it lacked the fibrous texture and was rubbery.. And the chicken fried rice..? there was hardly any chicken in it.. not more than 6 pieces.. this was utter disappointing..¬†
Please look into the hygiene factor and the food quality..!

"4743521","The Indira Nagar Street of Gachibowli hides away many gems. Rather they get hidden among the numerous number of restaurants in one street.
This place was a pleasant find. The ambience was good, spare the AC which was in its last moments. The management ought to look at it.
The staff was really courteous and the seating was also good, spare some chairs which were worn away with time.
Coming to food. The starter was a hit. There are many options to choose from, I went with Shanghai chicken and it was awesome. I would liked it a bit spicy but then again everyone has their own pallette.
Going forward ordered Lung Pao to go with Shanghai fried Rice. Both were really complimenting each other. The curry was not spicy even after asking. They were kind enough to change it. And then it complimented each other like anything.
Also I would like to mention that the quantity is a big plus here.
Had a awesome plate of food along with courteous staff and well to do ambience. Spar some points, this place is a must try for chinese enthusiasts.

"32494097","Visited this place to try some Asian food. It is dimly lit and is a decent restaurant apt to have dinner with families. We had ordered two dishes:
1.Salt n pepper chicken : Crispy juicy pieces of chicken which were seasoned well and tasted good with a hint of spice.
2. Shredded Lamb with chilli: the lamb was crispy fried and cooked well. The taste was also good.
Both the dishes were decent. The service was slow as the food took time to arrive. The interior should be improved upon and I didn't find it very appealing. Overall it was an OK experience at this place.

Surely wont come back. Because the only thing we liked is the food, I can order it online if I wanted. But ya, not cmg here again.

Coming to the food, we tried green Thai Curry, Okra, Mushroom and Dumplings. The aroma of the curry was impressive but it had a bit of spicy touch to it. Mushrooms and Okra were savoury, although the latter could have been made more crisp. Dumplings were the usual momos with a chutney that could have been more spicy.
Overall the place offers different experience from the mainstream cuisines and can be tried once in a blue moon.",4,"2018-05-19 14:55:19",90,121,0

the garlic noodles were so yum but on the other hand the pad Thai was awful, it was so overpowered with sauce and no sprouts and a very little of peanuts.
we used #zomatogold so it was kind of okay. ",3,"2018-05-14 19:11:44",16,283,0

We have tried khud phao (fried rice and gravy with capsicum spinach prawn /chicken) and crispy lamb. Lamb is ok but the rice is awesome. It will cost 788 for 2 people along with 2 glass of lime soda.The restaurant offers good Chinese and Thai food. Hope to visit again.
