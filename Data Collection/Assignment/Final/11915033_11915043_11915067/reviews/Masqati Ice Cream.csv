"16142730","This seemed like a new name in my Swiggy search and rainy season always calls for icecream, hence thought of trying.
They have family combo boxes in the range of Rs 150. The quantity of these boxes is 500 ml.
I ordered chocolate cookies tub. It was a decently sized tub with a mix of chocolate icecream, dry fruits, nuts, oreo biscuits and a lot more. The taste was decent, however i believe Hyd giving us ample choices for fresh icecreams has spoiled us.
However, if i see it from value of money perspective, it's a 5/5!! Looking forward to try more flavors",4,"2019-04-20 15:42:56",166,977,1
