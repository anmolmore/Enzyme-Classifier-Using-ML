"36387823","A little place in melting pot serving waffels which are rare to find around in that area.
Can improve on service.
The taste of the waffels reflect the owners passion. (sometimes can make it too sweet)😅
could be a little friendly on the pricing.🙂
overall liked it.👍",3,"2018-09-29 03:38:38",57,51,1
