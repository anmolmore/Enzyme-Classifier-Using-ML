"36491484","I ordered Barbeque chicken. It's not worth for the price. Don't try ordering here. He didn't even give cutlery and Tissues. They still need to improve a lot in giving service. ",1,"2019-04-05 22:59:26",1,23,1
"1635511","Giving 4 for the ambience and politeness of the staff. Had a spicy grilled chicken burger there yesterday. Taste-wise it wasn't that great; a spicy grilled chicken breast would have been better, but they used shredded chicken. Bun was fresh and tasted good. They gave it along with some wafers (or 'chips'). Just wish that there was a bit more attention to cleanliness and hygiene. The guy preparing it didn't wear gloves or a cap. He was touching the table, the cello tape machine (for packing the burger), plastic bag, shelves, you name it! If you don't mind someone handling your food, you'll like the place. Good music and wi-fi too. The outside road is too dusty though - just wish these shops would get together and do something about it.",4,"2019-02-06 08:54:47",86,646,0

"32274922","I am new to Hyderabad and this cafe is nearby to my hostel. Wanted to go since long, and finally made up a plan today evening.
Place looks different and is catchy. The lights and music. Good they play english songs.
I ordered Chicken Burger and Chicken Wings.
Both were not upto the mark I expected. I have had burgers that have been too filling and loaded with chicken. And Chicken Wings, I personally dont like every flavour in the wings. Chinese taste and also I don't like sprinkle of thyme on my food. It's quite strong taste for sprinkling. And both things dont go together. Cold Coffee was perfect.
If you wanna be amazing in business, you gotta prep up your game. Serve amazing food no matter even if it's in a place where people are not much familiar with your menu. But you got youngsters who look more pocket friendly cafes with amazing food.
Staff was nice. Thank you. Hope to visit again when I come to Hyderabad. ",2,"2018-12-16 02:15:24",63,181,3

"35503982","I ordered chicken shawarma from this place. The chicken filling was burned. Some chicken chunks were completely burned, while others were half burned and some were fine. Anyways it felt like chewing coal in the shawarma. It was a complete waste of money. If u go there and eat them u can ask for replacement, but since I selected home delivery so they cheated by placing burned chicken inside. This was my first and last order from the place, I'm never going to order again from here.",1,"2018-10-11 15:55:17",3,0,0

"35443147","Been here with couple of my friends. We ordered one hot chocolate coffee, mushroom soup and 6 pc chicken tikka. Coffee was a diluted compared to our last visit and tikka quantity is far less to the price, they are like small chocolate pieces. Totally not worth for chicken tikka.",2,"2018-08-22 18:43:03",7,1,1
"29223328","Quick Meal! Nice Place!
Happens to be the only cafe in its vicinity. Holy Moly serves as the best dining option in the price range. If planning to go, don't miss the cold coffee. The al fresco seating allows you to get the essence of the weather outside- an overcast evening or late night would be the best time to visit. The place has been refurbished which makes it better than before.",4,"2018-08-19 23:25:49",53,272,1

"64037418","Horrible,...the food was very very very chilly, not in the condition to take one single bite also.
How do you expect to eat when so much of red chilly is added.
the chicken was not even properly cooked. it was raw from inside
This is kind of food will give you colen cancer.
this was my first and last time ordering food from this place, 
Note to consumers: If you want to eat healthy food or atleast consumable food then for god sake plz don't order from this place.",1,"2018-08-07 21:56:11",1,0,0

"32131705","Catering to mostly PG residents in and around Financial district, Holy Moly is a surprisingly underrated place. With a good music playlist, holy moly has to offer great shakes and shawarmas. 
The place is reasonably priced and is great for your gang of friend to get a quick bite at.

"393923","A nice place to visit if you are in a mood for coffee and want to catch up with your friends in a pocket-friendly budget. I have had a cappuccino while my friends regularly have hot chocolate, its good for the price. The ambiance is nice, and particularly on a rainy, mild windy day. Service is prompt and friendly, the Milkyway burger is one of the better things served here. I regularly visit this place, and when the weather is nice its no-brainer, after a long day at the office. The pictures posted here are a bit old but the place is still similar. I am not a guy who would go to CCD or Starbucks every day so this is a very nice alternative to the same.",3.5,"2018-04-09 00:48:34",31,265,0

"52199394","Taste of food is good, but service is very disappointing for us, as the service person collected extra money for delivery charges.Â I have ordered for chicken wings which cost 100/- in addition to that 30/- delivery charges mentioned in the portal while I am booking the order but I am not available at the moment to receive delivery, soÂ  send my friend to collect the order. Service person asked 160/- saying that more 30/- for delivery charges.Â 
This is quite not satisfactory for us.Â  I really dont want this kind ofÂ  service.Â

"33093114","Located opposite to shangrila,
Had chicken tangdi kebab, chicken shawarma and chicken burger grilled.
Tangdi kebab is good and served with green chutney, chicken shawarma is ok but chicken burger is definitely worth a try.
Had veggies : lettuce, green and yellow pepper and lots of mayonnaise.
Overall worth a visit",3.5,"2017-12-22 09:59:48",439,1012,3

We visited the place and placed order for cold coffees and honey pancakes. While waiting we had to sit under the thatched roof with rats running all over the place.

"31986394","It's a surprising place in the isolated area of gowlidody. The place gave a different feel compared to its location. I had the veg burger. Although the burger was yummy, it was too spicy to enjoy it. We had strawberry and banana pancakes which we good too. And to finish it all up in the hot summer we all had their cold coffee which was good too.. ",3,"2017-04-03 09:26:08",26,792,0
