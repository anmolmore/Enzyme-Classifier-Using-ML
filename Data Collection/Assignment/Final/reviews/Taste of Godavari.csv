"91549500","The taste is heavenly.... Authentic Godavari taste... Quantity is more than i expected for the price being charged... i should say their prices are a steal. Great value for money.. This is first time for me here and I am very much satisfied. Its been 7 months in Hyderabad for me and this is the best I had so far. Would highly recommend. Thanks to the owner and cook for the great dinner.",5,"2019-03-28 23:38:19",1,0,0
