"14541441","I am surprised to such a rating for this restaurant. Maybe, this place was not good earlier, but my experience at this particular restaurant few days back was absolutely good. We ordered chicken hariyali kebabs, butter roti and kadai chicken. I would say the food is finger-licking and the price of the items is also decent.",3.5,"2016-08-02 18:17:10",685,792,0

"205389","Had been here sometime back and ordered soup and then we had Spl. Biryani, which was not at all nice. The biryani was bland and not tasty. It was just like they were serving us some pulav or something.
The person on the counter was doubling up as the service person too. Not a too bad service, it is okay.",3,"2015-12-10 20:30:41",15,16,0
"1554778","This Review is strictly from vegetarian point of View and for Vegetarians who follow it religiously.
So, Being a vegetarian, i would generally do not prefer to go places where non-veg is served but during team outings or dining with teammates or office mates i would visit such places.
This review is after a disastrous lunch i had couple of days back. The taste of Veg Biryani was below avg. . But i'm going to concentrate on the service. The service provided is pathetic. The guys who are serving would not use any hygienic way to serve the food, they put their hands in non-veg dishes and then without any proper glove or covers would serve the vegetarian food (Even after requesting for a change of the person to serve vegetarian).
Even the bill provided was having wrong calculations , later after a discussion it was corrected.
Later before we left , We had a discussion with the Branch Manager too, But after the discussion i understand there is no point in visiting such place as there is no respect for the customers.",1,"2015-12-07 14:59:02",7,20,0

"31480678","Taka away was good both chicken and mutton biryani. I believe prices are very reasonable. Mutton pieces are very less in the biryani.Â Tried this out let for Â the first time and was satisfied with the food. Request to add more pieces to the mutton biryani (price too) would make the foodies happy. Mutton biryani with out pieces would serve no good",4,"2015-10-21 10:25:09",6,166,0
"1231476","An underdog in the world of restaurants. But still took my heart away. Visited this place a few days back for dinner and had to say it was not at all disappointing. We ordered tandoori chicken,which was have to say by all means the best tandoori chicken i ever had in any of my food hunts. It was soft and succulent and just melted in the mouth. Do give it a try for sure. Next up was butter chicken which kind of made me disappointed with a bland gravy but a little tweak Â of mine made it fine. The naan were soft and really great. As an overall I was fully satisfied with the tandoori chicken itself. About the ambiance i can say not that great but 3/5 is a good score.Food too share the same scores 3/5. Service was okayish 3/5. Overall 3.5/5.",3.5,"2015-10-12 10:50:49",136,1601,0
"5198761","Had been to this place couple of months back, we had Chicken Biryani then. It was tasty . Today wanted to take away Chicken Biryani. It was horrible and couldn't believe that it was from the same place.
There was too much salt. no biryani flavour and the gravy was horrible too.
No more Biryani from here.",1,"2015-10-12 00:34:51",26,559,0
"29511492","No rating I believe , I had a biryani , and the chicken was I dont know it was fresh or an old stock reused , it was smelling , I had a Takeaway . The Biryani is devastating . The competitor Green Bawarchi is superb.",1,"2015-10-08 21:59:07",1,101,0
"1063789","God awful food!!!  Even if this is the last place you have to eat food, I would suggest not to go in there...  Such an insult to ""paradise"" 
And if I could give a 0 instead of 1 I would.  Terrible! ",1,"2015-10-06 20:17:45",2,0,0
"16415509","Food is totally bad.. Rotti and curry was quite ok when compared to the biryani they served. Chicken in biryani was rotten. And rice didn't have any masala. I would rather rate it in minus but got no option. Please people don't ever try. ",1,"2015-09-28 23:37:46",3,0,0
"1467871","Rating on a scale of 1 to 5.Â 
Ambience- 2.4 Food - 2.3 Service - 3.0 Value - 2.3 Overall - 2.4
We dropped by here to see if it would make a good lunch place. The place needs some work and food is not that great. We went straight for the Indian Veg Combo and first thing we see, is its over priced. The taste isn't that great but isn't bad either. Not sure about other items but looking at the combo (which is supposed to be a good deal) I assume things will be over priced.
Some where I feel they need to be more authentic with what they want to sell. Is it a regular lunch place or a different restaurant or a unique food place or themed place.
Better service, better food is needed. Give both of them for a better price, this would pitch higher up",2.5,"2015-09-23 18:27:47",50,245,2
"1759391","Had a lunch with friends service was pretty much good ambient is not so great but place seems to be clean. Starters were good with little bit extra salty.  Not recommend for team party or team lunch just having a lunch is advisable. ",2.5,"2015-08-05 14:54:55",9,36,0
