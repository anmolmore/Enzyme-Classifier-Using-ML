Ambience -
This is the smallest place i have ever seen serving some amazing food..... The kitchen is placed and cabitaned into a royal enfield bike... And the place is exactly in betweeen the ratnadeep market and the bajaj electronics near gachibowli she team police station..... And it is only available in the evening times....
Food -
Food is the bestest part of this place.... This place has given some major food cravings which i really want to fulfil at any point of time..... So,these are the things which we tried over here....
Tandoori Chicken momos - Delhi ka famous momos are here in hyderabad and are served by this place and the red colored momos slightly having the color of grilled black and the softness felt when touched and the juicy chicken stuffed in the momos are the best momos i have ever had..
Soya Chaap - Soya chaap is also one of the best served dish over here,It is perfectly marinated and then cooked and this was one of the dish which made me go head over heels..... The thickness,the marination,the spices were perfect.
Chicken sheekh kebab - The sheekh kebab is one of the best thing which we had and this is served along with green chutney and red chutney and some spiced onions and lemons which gave me the full-fledged street food satisfaction.
Peri-peri chicken - The peri peri chicken was perfectly cooked and the spices added to this were the best part of this dish and having them along with rumali roti gave some major combo goals.....
Service -
So this place is managed by two people and i couldnt meet one of them since she was not available at the time we had food. But they were really very sweet and good people who help u and serve u very very good and tasty food.... The cost of the food is budget friendly......",5,"2019-05-08 23:18:11",94,134,0

The owner is brilliant and always so very sweet to his customers. The spices they put in the food takes me back to Delhi days. Momos are out of the world, I would recommend tyring tandoori chicken Momos. Great place, 5 stars from me üòäüòä",5,"2019-03-09 19:33:14",2,4,0

"8271881","So finally crave for chaaps ended when i visited this place. Its not a seating restaurant , however its a one of its own kind bike concept where in tandoor is installed on the back seat of bullet. Its not hard to find out as the smell of charcoal will drive you and stop your vehicle just opposite to it.Coming on to food , Chaaps i had in lucknow and chaaps i had here were very identical and were very light in taste. Rates for such food is pehnomenol. Value for your hard earned money for sure. Owner (Harshit) was very helpful in helping us select the items to eat. Its definetly a 10 on 10 for chaap momos and chicken. Will love you to visit you guys soon. All the best guysüëçüèª",5,"2019-02-14 20:19:49",5,96,0
"38886625","Happiness is served on this bike, literally! A rescue for everyone who love kebabs and chaap, Sholay the BBQ Bike is just the perfect place to give a rest to hunger pangs. Located at Indra Nagar beside Ratnadeep, this BBQ Bike will be your number 1 place for sure.
We tried their Chaap, Kebabs and loved every bit of it. Seekh Kebab is something that you just can't miss here. Malai chaap is again very fresh and tasty, the consistency and texture was just how it should be. The menu is priced at a very affordable rate.
These guys make their own soya for chaap and you can feel the freshness. The cream that they use is also home made.
Do try them out as soon as you can a d trust us, you will become their regular customer ",5,"2019-02-14 00:09:47",204,1629,0

"27921088","Great chicken kebabs and eye catching concept of kebabs on a bullet. Chicken was juicy and well marinated and the spices they used was also good but they have put too much of the sauce for tossing the kebabs after it was done so it had tad bit too much of liquid in it and it over powered the grilled kebab texture.
I would still have given it 4 stars if the service was not that slow. I had to wait for more than half an hour to get my order as they had many order to prepare on the veg grill and then the non veg grill was put up. 
I would love to try the other kebabs option as well if only the service becomes little faster. ",3,"2019-01-05 11:09:11",95,299,0
"49766716","Delhi ke Momos hona?
Don‚Äôt go Delhi for Delhi‚Äôs famous street food.
Thanks to Sholay The BBQ bike to get the mouth watering hot grilled momos in Hyderabad all the way from DELHI.
Basically. It‚Äôs a bike turned out in a stall. They heat up the coals and grill the marinated chicken tikka or seekh kabab or the momos over it and serve you with Mayonnaise or any kind of sauce you prefer.
All the raw materials added in it are straight away from Delhi to give you the complete feel of Delhi style.
I ordered a Chicken Seekh Kabab Chicken Tikka & Chicken Momos.
‚Ä¢Chicken Seekh Kabab:-Marinated and grilled over the skewer right in front of us and serve us hot,with mayonnaise. Very well marinated really delicious can‚Äôt ask for more.
‚Ä¢Chicken Tikka Kabab:-Marinated well. Grilled over the grill pan and served us hot,with mayonnaise. Really tasty and spicy giving the complete fee of Delhi style.
‚Ä¢Momos:- Momos is not a snack. It‚Äôs a feeling which Sholay the BBQ bike bought it here. It was soo soft that one just cannot stop asking for more. Worth a try. And worth the price.
Overall the place is really cool with the new style of bike outlet and the delicious food.
Hang-on guys it‚Äôs just a beginning for them with limited items on the menu they‚Äôre planning for more varieties on the menu and even for the seating arrangement for the customers making their customers feel comfortable.
Prices are really pocket friendly next time if you‚Äôre in Gachibowli Do not forget to stop at this outlet which is next to Ratnadeep supermarket in Gachibowli.

"29281054","I ordered for delivery and received way too less quantity. For 120 bucks they give hardly 5-6 tiny pieces. Absolutely not worth the money. Owner should increase the quantity.

"40886738","This place has an amazing different experience to give to the people. We ordered a plate of chicken tandoori momos. It had an amazing spicy charcoal flavour with it. The staff were also very attentive and polite. A few suggestions to give:
1. Please add some mocktail or cold drink to your menu which would act as a relief with the spicy food.
2. I guess the place will soon become famous. So please if you can make it bit more organised.
3. A soup can also go well in your menu since it's winter time coming.",4,"2018-12-02 13:26:24",17,41,1

"33376100","The whole BBQ bike set up is such a unique and innovative concept. I'm really am huge fan of this idea. As I'm mad street food person, I had to visit this place. 
They really have a limited but best menu to offer. They came up with a really wonderful and delicious menu which includes chaap, tikka, momos in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian as well. And the best part is that, they also have mixed platters where you can try all of em together. 
I've tried - mixed non-veg platter, tandoori momos, soya chaap tikka and chicken tikka. 
Mixed non-veg platter consists of - chicken tandoori momos, chicken tikka and chicken seek kebab. I did love all of em. 
I also tried them individually as I loved them so much. 
This is the only place in town, which serves Tandoori momos. The momos here are really amazing. I absolutely loved the charred flavor of the momos. They are steamed, marinated and grilled perfectly. These are really a must try for all the momo lovers. 
Soya chaap tikka is really unique. You might not find it anywhere. It really tastes very good. Vegetarians you also have something different to try now. 
Chicken Tikka was so good too. I really loved how juicy and flavorful it was. 
All the street food lovers, this place is definitely for you guys. Do not miss out on this amazing one. You will not regret visiting them. I totally recommend this place and I'm going to be visiting them on a regular basis. ",4.5,"2018-11-28 01:31:21",260,3287,4

Chicken Tikka was buttery and yum. I also took chicken momos to have later at home. But all I observed was the real fun was to have it at the restaurant than to take away. Overall a good experience.

"44586620","Ordered Soya Chaap and Chicken tikka online.
Soya Chaap- it was delivered cold (maybe because its quite far from my place)
Tasted old, like the onions which were added to the dish had an awful smell, the soya pieces were also very chewy, perhaps a stale dish.
Chicken tikka- this one tasted nice and fresh though it had coriander leaves on it for no reason.
The chutney which they give is only sufficient for one bite.
They should work on their quality too, very less for the price.
Expected much more from this place but was a complete disaster. Wouldn't recommend anyone to order from here, maybe having there could be a better experience. ",2,"2018-11-21 19:21:17",31,21,3

"47231230","I had the chicken seekh kabab at Sholay The BBQ.
It was one hell of an experience!
The Royal Enfield marked my eyes and I had to stop to see what this was all about!
The smell of grilling from far off made the experience all the more exciting and yummy.
That was about the ambience, about the food, I can‚Äôt describe the deliciousness of the food I was served!

"8925241","Sholay the bbq bike is such a unique and innovative food bike located beside Ratnadeep, Gacchibowli. It is a Royal Enfield at the back of which is the bbq grill. This whole setup looks pretty fascinating. While on the other hand, the service was good too. Very courteous and friendly. The owners themselves made sure we were taken care of. And finally coming to the food, it was fabulous. For now, the menu is limited as this place was opened only a few weeks back. Not even a month old. But whatever we have tried, were just made to perfection.¬†
Food tried:
1. Chicken seekh kebab- This was the first ever time that I went head over heels for Seekh Kebab and damn I fell in love with them. The tender and perfectly cooked seekh covered in delicious sauces with a side of onions and green chutney, purely heavenly.
2. Chicken Tandoori momos- The last time I had momos was years ago and I had a bad experience. But after I heard about this place and their Tandoori momos, I just had to try them. When I did try, I really liked them. The tandoori marination was just too good. Just a small drawback, they could have been hot. Maybe they got cold because of the weather. Otherwise yes no other suggestion.¬†
3. Soya Chaap- Again, the sauces and the marination were good. Tasted good too. The thickness of the soya could be slightly more. However, talking about the taste, they were pretty fine.
Personal favourite: Chicken Seekh Kebab
Thanks for the invite. Had a great time.¬†",5,"2018-10-31 22:38:08",105,1158,3

"50023145","Recently I was invited for food tasting session to Sholay the BBQ bike , Gachibowli. It's a franchise to the one in Ghaziabad, Delhi. It's the first time that Hyderabad will experience a live BBQ being done on a bike, that too a modified ROYAL ENFIELD. I found this concept of BBQ on bike to be quite creative & fun . I tried paneer tikka, chicken Momo's, soya chaap and chicken seekh kebab from this place. Everything tasted great. But Chicken momos & soya chaap served with two different sauces left me asking for more. And surprisingly everything here is just under Rs 100 , super duper affordable isn't it ? Make sure you definitely try out their veg & non-veg delicious tikkas & kebabs with your friends on the go .
