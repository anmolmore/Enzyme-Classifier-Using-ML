"48353445","I have been waiting to add this review for quite some time now. The combo from Chinese wok goes out of availability quickly and I had to struggle to order. Once I did, I understood why. The fried rice was awesome. I ordered an egg fried rice with chilli chicken combo. The price was reasonable and the taste was awesome. The quantity could have been better. Overall, I love the Chicken Fried Rice too. The packaging for non combo items is top notch. The packaging for combos could be improved.",5,"2018-12-09 20:16:29",11,7,1

The drive-in has a good option of food choices.",4,"2018-09-15 12:32:34",1031,1653,0
