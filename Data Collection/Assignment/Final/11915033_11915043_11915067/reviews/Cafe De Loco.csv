"37248917","I saw this place long back in the news paper and today made it here
the directions were like a puzzle,
We entered and i had doggs all over me ( I love dogs) so the excitement was real this place has such a beautiful (doggy menu) the dogs are friendly we ordered for bruschetta and lemon chilli potato the presentation was nice although I wish the bruschetta had more flavor all I tasted was cheese it was like a garlic bread there wasn't any sauce to it the potato was decent.... I'd love to visit for the doggies esp muffin",3,"2019-05-02 04:49:57",63,144,1
"30770089","Love their brownies and iced tea here. I visit this place mostly for the ambience and the great atmosphere. They always have so many activities lined up for the dogs. It's a great location to bring out your pet for activities as well. ",5,"2019-04-27 17:33:55",344,975,0
"2011754","Finally after planning for months I visited this place! This place is a gem for pet lovers. The owners of this place are very good. They gave the instructions and made sure that we feel comfortable there (as I went there with my 1.3 year old niece who loves dog). There are variety of food for dogs and trust me if you want to take your dog somewhere then this is the place to be! Also, they keep dogs for adoption..so if you are interested in adopting a dog please contact the owner. ",5,"2019-04-11 07:40:51",5,1,0
"36723204","Went there for pet adoption drive on Sunday. There was only one pup for adoption so we thought we will come back next week. But for the 5 mins spent on the property the owner asked 3 of us to pay cover charge of 600 total. We said ok, let's buy something using Zomato gold. Even there he denied Zomato gold. Tried to reason with him but to be honest his attitude ensured that our experience was not good. And the food that came after all this hoopla, was really not tasty at all. Without doubt this will be our last visit to Cafe de loco. There was no option of zero star, hence giving it one star",1,"2019-04-10 10:42:02",1,75,0
"39908199","Owners of this place have a mad dog who attacks people and other fellow dogs. If you love your dog never take him/her to this place. Moreover owners are not even apologetic. I had to rush to hospital for me and my dog. Highly not recommendable",1,"2019-03-23 21:39:38",4,19,0
"31733673","Lovely place for a nice evening with pets. 3 star for the place. The food sucks. Do not go here to eat! 
And Zomato Gold was not accepted today, I was told there is a Karaoke event and Zomato gold will not be applied when there is an event (Disappointed). 
All em dogs are fun to play. They are friendly. But food! Uuffff no. Don‚Äôt ask :( 
But yes, will come back for sure. Love the place though! Apoorva Ganapathi ",3,"2019-03-23 20:46:00",234,688,7
"37347809","Highly rated and the pet friendly cafe which made me to choose this place on a Saturday eve for my Chiko.
First of all the path way and the ambiance is not welcoming and top of that we need to pay the cover charge of 200/- per person which can be redeemable against food. Note: Zomato will not covered within cover charge.
Being a dog lover i felt this ‚ÄòPet Cafe‚Äô is not fit for those who wanted to leave their dogs freely. ( Better to choose GHMC Dog Park at Gachibowli) During our 1.5 hr time mostly we spend time to safeguard our pet from their guard dogs. But this is an ideal place for the dog lovers alone, without their pets.
Zomato menu is not updated one; refer Dineout menu for accuracy.
Its a self service cafe, we ordered ‚ÄòLoco Delight - Chicken‚Äô 210/-and ‚ÄòBaked Loco Biscuits‚Äô 150/- for our pet and find difficult to arrange the place to avoid their house dogs. Unfortunately he dint ate and they arranged the parcel for 10/- Extra.
We got Masala Fries-Indian herbs with packet sauce 150/-  tastes medium and Bread Pakoda with podina chutney 150/- can give a try for the spices.
They have different calculation on tax and arent willing to provide the bill. Even i dint demand the bill and verge of leaving the place as early as possible. ",1,"2019-03-09 23:08:28",6,5,0

"3232413","A paradise for dog lovers !!
First of all I am crazy about dogs so ambience and food was secondary for me, the thing that hit me was presence of these happy souls around you.
The owner has two babies Lara(indian breed girl) and Pluto(Lhasa apso guard dog), and Pluto apprently is the boss, they have also kept some rescued pups for adoption which happens every Sunday + there is a day boarding facility for all the working people who are unable to take their pets to work.The guest can bring their pets to play around while the parent chill and relax in the ambience that they have created. They let dogs play and roam around, pet owners must visit this place.
All in all its a very comfy and cozy place to be, for pet as well as the owner.
Coming to the food, so they have a very basic menu nothing so complicated that can make u think if u should try or not. We ordered -
#garlic bread- 5/5 soft beard with freshly chopped garlic
#Cheese chili toast- 4/5 taste was good I just felt quantity of cheese on the toast was bit less
#masala chai- 4.5/5 good taste but since I like more milk in my tea , this tea wasn't that Milky
Not to mention they also have a separate menu for your furry friend. So Go get em all.
Highly recommended if u are a pet owner or a dog lover ",5,"2019-02-13 15:58:46",12,13,1
"29667098","First time been to a pet friendly place...!
Neat ambience and playful environment.
Dint feel like leaving this place...!
I am generally very scared of dogs but these pets are so friendly and warm to play with..
Food is too good...never had this proper pasta anywhere...
Takes time for food.
But you wouldn't know when you play with those pets around...
Would love to visit again üòäüòäüòä

"35265709","It was one of the most beautiful place I have been in long time! Loved the concept! The cafe was so out of the box, even with the decor. There are books, games and oh my God, the most adorable dogs! Food was some what 3/5 but everything else there makes it up for it. The owners were really nice and friendly. There is a cover entry charges :)",4,"2019-01-06 16:13:06",14,12,2
"38049215","The food is overall good.
Bread pakora is a must try, awesome.
Masala tea is good too.
Burger was decent, could have been better and fuller for the price.
However, the exp at the place is awesome, especially if you are a pet lover.",4,"2019-01-01 19:36:11",34,233,0

"1849334","An outdoor cafe populated with dogs, this served some really good food. Albeit, a bit slow. The dogs running amok were a delight. Don't be surprised if they climb on top of the table or your lap to try and get some food. 
There's a cover charge of ‚Çπ200 per person which is completely redeemable at the counter. I suggest visiting the place on a cool day as even with fans it can get quite warm. ",4,"2018-12-12 09:32:48",38,109,5
"75954751","Entry fees to the place charged me 200 per pax.Ambiance of pets depends on the visitors as the pets been there are mainly of visitor's .when i visited the place there are few dogs whos presence was like no pets zone.you can find more in streets or parks and though it was Sunday 5 pm .I got disappointed mainly when they refused to reedem two of my zomato gold coupon, which I unlocked .I could have used it for my dinner which I paid fully.After billing they gave me this choice that for 6 people I need to buy atleast 1200 then I can reedem zomato gold ,I did but even after the discount using zomato gold was of the lowest amount (coffee).i tried but failed and gave him whatever money he asked for ,without bill(1900) * .If you are thinking of food using zomato gold then you shouldn't go.And I request zomato to please let us know the details what deal we need to face before booking.And the main point is that they are not providing bills ,as I payed the money they gave me the bank receipt no bills were attached to it.",2,"2018-12-10 04:04:49",13,5,1
"72548095","Not getting biased to anyone, it was a Very bad experience. Very less pets. Taking 200 entry fees per person doesn't justify. Zomato gold can be used but they will play tricks while taking money and charge u more. Food is also not so good specially drinks.Visit on your own preference.",1,"2018-12-09 19:56:18",2,3,0
"2319082","Based on zomato reviews I had visited this place. Firstly, point to be noted this place is a cafe for pets.   Its not a regular cafe, with service and ambience.
I had visited this place at 8pm it was quite empty. 
Its a self service place.
* They charged a min of 200 per person.
* I ordered barbecue sandwich and coffee, was good.
* As this cafe is for pets, the ambience is quite different.
* Cleanliness can be improved. Found a bit of dust on tables and chairs.
* Mosquitoes:(
* The Lady was polite in taking the order and advised us to apply mosquito repellent. 
* Dont expect great food here.
I would say this place is unique, Service and Cleanliness can be improved. Albeit you could take your pet here and spend your evening. ",3,"2018-11-17 19:19:57",12,2,0
"31705472","This place has disappointed us in every possible way, I won‚Äôt say that our timing was wrong as not everything can go wrong with wrong timing.
Starting with the food we ordered spinach chicken sandwich, mixed sauce pasta and masala tea.
Sandwich was a home made white bread extra hard chicken stuffed sandwich.
Pasta tasted more like some indian masala mix pasta with lot of chilli flakes added on top.
And lastly the masala tea was something i would never like to try again.
Now looking at the ratings of this place, i would say all pet lovers like me would have visited & rated this so high looking at the dogs here. Otherwise I don‚Äôt see anything to be rated this high.
This place is a self service place and I appreciate that, but a self service place should also provide bills after payment, i was expecting a bill as what I ordered was suggested by the staff and was not on the menu, waited for the bill expecting it to be given with our food but it wasn‚Äôt given.
Excuses like i have just shut down the system and I won‚Äôt be able to provide the bill now are not acceptable, we even left our email and mobile number to get back with the bill.
Lastly, this restaurant had a condition on using Zomato gold membership, which was the bill should be above 400 and I don‚Äôt know how the bill got upto  700+ and on that i got a discount and the bill was 621. Not sure how as i am still waiting for the bill.
All in all I won‚Äôt recommend this place, first coz of the food quality and second for their unprofessional behaviour.",1,"2018-11-16 17:55:44",100,275,8
"2850992","This is definitely a heaven for dog lovers. They have a big space for dogs to play around. The vibe of the place is so chill, you could really spend hours here. We went there on a weekday so there was nobody else around except a couple who had their own three dogs. They also a room full of papers covered with dog paw impressions with their name which was literally so cute. We didn't get the chance to experiment much with the food as we only ordered a cold coffee, some fries and nuggets. But I can't wait to be back here, hopefully when more people (and definitely their pets) are around ",4,"2018-11-15 23:14:52",23,10,0

"16142730","Went there on a Sunday evening. They had two dogs Oscar and Abby and there were guests with their different dogs as well. The place is set up in Gachibowli in a plot giving a good space for dogs to play.
Oscar was my favorite and i had a great time with him. Coming to the food i had white sauce pasta which was quite dry but they ordered broccoli and vegetables i like, so i was really happy. Then i had Nutella Crepe. Frankly, it was the best crepe i ever had. It was simply amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è
Looking forward to visit the place again and spend an amazing time with the dog and the owner again. ",4,"2018-10-08 21:11:56",166,977,0
"9188691","Oh for the love of doggos, please visit. I have been there twice already, and i love the rustic feel of the place. It's right beside Al Saba in Gachibowli. You might have a little trouble finding the place, but nothing that should put you off.
The hooman food is good. I loved the Kolkata special roll - reminded me of home. Prices are a little steep, but i didn't mind much. I was too enthralled by the doggos just being themselves in the campus.
P.s. the pets roam free and might come down to say hello. And the place usually has an adoption drive every Sunday.
I loved the concept, hopefully, so will you! ",5,"2018-09-23 20:43:23",22,158,0

I went alone was greeted by three handsome and beautiful dogs Luna, choco and abby(she's the naughtiest)
The owners(Roochira and Hemant) are a breath of fresh air to talk to and be around. They tell me how their dishes can be eaten by the pets as well.(awesomeness) It was amazing. I had ordered a Frappuccino and a bong wrap. It was really delicious. I spent most of my time playing with the pets people brought here.

I‚Äôd say you‚Äôd like the cafe a lot more if you are a dog lover. While the food is good too, the highlight of the cafe is the dogs that inhabit it. And such well behaved ones, at that!
Coming to the food, we ordered the bread pakoda (5/5), mushroom cheese sandwich (5/5), BBQ grilled sandwich (3/5 - a little too salty), pink sauce pasta (4/5 - again, too much salt) and the cold coffee (5/5 yum!!). 
Do visit if you wish to unwind, spend some time with amazing dogs and equally amazing hosts :) they have a separate menu for your pets too! p.s., fyi, there‚Äôs a cover charge of 200 per person, which is redeemable with food.

The place is all things Pets. If you have a pet pooch or are a meagre pet lover like me, this place should definitely be on your Sunday to do list. 
The place welcomes you to a very rustic style ground surrounded by small brick shed cubes to seat yourself and your pet. A few basins and sanitizer  scattered across the place ensure hygiene. 
It is an experience on its own and if you are a dog lover, you will surely be delighted. Their in-house baby Pluto is quite the eye-candy. 
While as far as the food is concerned, I have only tried their Cold coffee with ice-cream, which is simple and summery. I am surely coming back to try more of their menu. There are ample treats for pets too. ",4,"2018-05-21 00:55:36",96,1068,1

"1982182","Cafe De Loco, this wonderful cafe is located in the tiny lane adjacent to AL Saba restaurant . you might feel that you have come to the wrong location untill you actually hit the dead end of the road and see the board to your right .
If you are afraid of dogs , I would suggest you enter with a friend who isn't, because the moment you enter , you will be greeted by a few furry angels . If you are fond of dogs , then get ready to be overwhelmed with the sheer cuteness you will face .
Anyway , let's get to the food . I just ordered a cafe Mocha and mushroom omlette
Coffee : The coffee was good . it comes with a cookie too. It wasn't really hot but it was just about warm enough . no complains . however , if you are someone whomlikes their hot beverage boiling hot , then probably you may have an issue. The taste is really good though . 3.5/5
Omlette : i ordered a mushroom omelette which comes with 2 slices of bread . The omlette was like something your mother would make for you. It's comfort food . nothing fancy, but simple and good . worth repeating . 4/5
Let's talk about the people
everyone there is really friendly . it's almost as if you have come to a a friends place . From what I could observe , it's a family run place . right from the person who takes your order at the counter to the people who are cooking , all give you a very positive vibe . the furry companions there will just melt your heart .
You will run out of hugs and cuddles to give . You can enter the cafe with a bad mood , but you will definitely Leave with a smile on your face
Humans and Furry friends at the cafe 5/5
This place is definitely worth visiting and repeating .",4,"2018-04-07 23:13:30",7,19,3
"637429","Cafe De Loco is not just a Cafe; its a Huge relief for pet-parents who have little choice but to leave/keep their pets in a closed flat or room, most of the days. Hats off to Hemant and Roochira for coming up with this concept of providing not just an ideal play-space for our pets but also give a lot of love and care for those using the pet-daycare facility. Yes, you heard it right; they have a pet-daycare facility from 9AM to 5PM (Mgmt please correct me if I am wrong) and at around 300/400 per day, its a Great facility to have for those who want to leave their pets in an loving and affectionate place while away for a few hours. My puppy always enjoys the place to the fullest and has learned a lot to socialize with other dogs only because of this place. Hemant, Roochira and the rest of their staff treat each pet as their own. They also keep a lot of rescued puppies and try their best to give them a new lease of life by hosting adoption drives, all at their own cost. Very few human beings care so much about abandoned pups, these days. Its a treat to go there and play with the cuties all day long; I wish I had enough space in my house to adopt them all.As far as food is concerned, I have tried very few of the dishes but the Cappuccino deserves special mention. Roochira makes a killer Cappuccino; its one of the best I have ever had; although I usually don't like milk in my coffee. Their sandwiches are pretty good. Only item on my checklist, is to try their BBQ, some day, as it takes some pre-planning and advance notice for preparation.Overall, a boon for pet-owners and pet-lovers and I request all pet-owners to patronize this place as much as possible to keep the good work going!",5,"2018-03-27 18:47:12",20,118,0

This place is a restaurant for your pet.. those daily boring pedigree and drools with not so tasty raw meat or egg,, this place will turn on the taste buds of your pet dog..
Located in the hidden land near royal enfield service station on gachibowlii road..this place doesn't look like a restaurant from outside.. with its sign board you would still not be sure that it's a dog restautant..
It's a treat for dog lovers as you can play and hang around with some lovely pet dogs and talk to their owners.. simultaneously you can grab something quick..
Food is ok.. as it seems a little pricey when we look at the quantity but yes they have limited tables and limited people with some good shacks and playful noises of dogs.. they have a cover charge of 200 rupees per person which you can redeem on food but still have to shell out some more money if you decide to fill your stomach!!
They have variety of food for your pets as well which you can buy and feed your pet if you don't want to buy for yourself..
Service is a little slow as they have only two people working in Kitchen ... But they are very friendly and good to talk to..
It's a go to place to have some tea and coffee and chit chat with your loved ones or friend who are dog lovers...",3.5,"2018-03-05 04:31:15",13,267,0
"507433","3 Points only for making an exceptional effort to make a cafe for furry friends. I am a regular on weekends and will be. A great place to meet other Dog parents and socialise and My Gabbar just loves it here as he can explore, wander, play at his own pace. I am not very big fan of the food as it can be improved for the price but ready to let it go cause of the ambience. They also have some cover charges per person so you have to eat no matter what. Its a crime if you have a pet and don‚Äôt go to this place (LOL).",3,"2018-02-21 13:54:13",92,349,0
"32024214","One of the best places to visit in Hyderabad, if you're a dog lover. Spacious for dogs to play, humans can live too üòÇ
They have a wide variety of snacks available, freshly prepared and very hygienic. The kitchen is open. Hosts are lovely people (Mr Hemant, Ms Ruchira and the helper Ms Lavanya).. they will make you feel at home. They have their own dogs and few on board ones.. all of them so friendly üòÄ
The take away point: definitely visit the place feel relaxed. They have free WiFi üòÉüòÉ",5,"2018-02-14 19:16:49",36,27,0

"32331267","This is a half review as I haven't tried anything in the menu coz the sole purpose was to attend the pet adoption drive and I loved the place.
There were around 6 to 7 pets in this place and they were friendly.i had a great time with them.The place is like a hut kind embience and there is a board with colour mark of pet feet (adopted) with their name and surname. That was really sweet. One can adopt a pet with few paper works.
I wish I could go again to adopt one of the little bundle of loveüòä",4,"2017-12-03 21:46:40",174,1283,3

"36114682","We had a great time at this place. Our dogs especially loved it here. The hosts were wonderful!! They have a special menu for dogs, big area for the dogs to explore and have kept in mind small details like having fresh water available for the dogs. They also have many paw prints of all the visiting dogs which is really cute. For the humans, there's a relaxing chilled out atmosphere, with picnic benches ,large screen TV, good food and the hosts are very friendly and welcoming!! Great place for a relaxed evening out with your four legged companions. üë©üê∂üêæ",4.5,"2017-09-24 01:18:14",3,3,2

"1311848","A cafe where pets can hang out and they definitely seem to be having the time of their lives! Spotlessly clean, extremely safe, yummy food for the pets and owners alike, this charming cafe is perfect if you want an evening out with your pet. Even if you are a pet lover, you will love spending time here.
We can let our dogs off the leash and let them play with other people and dogs, without a worry in the world. 
The cafe owners are a warm and friendly couple, and the last time we went there for coffee, we ended up eating dinner there!
The place is thoughtfully designed to be so pet-friendly, and the vibe is just right for a relaxed evening out. The best part is that your pet is not left alone at home while you are out, and they will surely enjoy themselves more than you!",5,"2017-09-09 23:49:57",1,6,0
"45628633","Couldn't help but fall in love with this place, and I'm sure I wouldn't be lying when I say my doggo felt the same. We took our pug Guppy there for dinner, and him being a big foody devoured everything we ordered for him off the special paws menu. Although he doesn't usually eat vegetables, he licked his bowl clean, cabbage and all. The ambience of the place is very low-key, comfortable, and not to mention clean. Guppy was able to roam around and explore, with a lot of place to run around. The food is great - even for homo sapiens :') - and the hosts are extremely friendly. I would definitely recommend checking the place out, even if you don't have a pet. Love the concept! Keep it up :)",5,"2017-09-09 11:55:02",6,9,0

"44797884","Great place!!! Great hosts!!! Finally an interesting hang out in Hyderabad. Open air, non-fussy, chilled out place to unwind. Not a typical restaurant. Run by a couple who freely mingle with the guests and entertain you with interesting conversation. Food is delicious too. Not the regular oily stuff. So that was a relief.
We don't own a pet. Landed at the cafe out of curiosity. It was nice to see pets enjoying their strolls and actually socialising with each other.¬†
Cool place. Will definitely visit again.",4.5,"2017-08-10 21:56:42",1,3,0

"546515","Nice place to hang out. I think the only place in Hyderabad where your pooch is welcomed more than you and the joy it results in is unparalleled. These guys have made it a task to stick to the roots and keep this place as natural as possible. You don't feel you are in a cafe or a restaurant.. you just feel that you are at your friends farm house relaxing and playing with your pet while ordering food. This is a must go to place and a regular hangout spot for all the dog lovers of Hyderabad. Special mention of Hemant who has a keen taste of old style which led to gather everything from yesteryears!! 
In short awesome place and do visit once..  You will become a regular. That's a promise!!!",5,"2017-07-30 01:59:07",1,47,0

The food is made by Roochira herself and is amazing in its simplicity and quality. Can't wait to take our doggies to the weekend barbeque.

"43442321","I loved the whole idea of a cafe made for pets. A beautiful place, with an open ground for the dogs to run about. Before leaving, they take a paw print of all dogs who visit the place. And our puppy loved the food that he was served (Chicken Lentil Soup). He licked every last drop of it! Definitely a must visit for every pet owner.",5,"2017-07-07 18:40:14",2,6,1

"32733031","Awesome cafe with good theme of huts and with the concept of village. This cafe has an especially different idea, which is really very thoughtful. People who are dog lovers do not feel like leaving their 'son' or 'daughter' at home! So this is the place where you can take your babies and they can roam freely. They have a special different menu known as 'Menu for pets'. Sherlock had boiled chicken and he enjoyed thoroughly! We had chocolate shake, green tea, watermelon juice, chicken and veg sandwiches. The sandwiches were yummy and the stuffings was really nice. ",4,"2017-05-14 20:16:09",62,199,0
