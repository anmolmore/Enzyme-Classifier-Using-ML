"31559124","Recently ordered a salad from this place. Horrible salads - it was just some boiled vegetables thrown together with some boiled chicken, and what came out was a soupy salad that tastes horrible. Not going to order from here again, so save your money you all!",1,"2019-04-14 22:25:40",4,34,0
"32732516","I happened to order two meals on two different days from here.
The first common observation is, they super delay in making their orders.
The Zomato guy reaches and waits like for long.
Foodwise, I ordered because the menu seemes appealing to me.
The sunny side ups were good. No red chilly powder added. Which was great.
Thr bread is where they can improve upon.
And I didn't get any cut fruits that was mentioned in the menu. ",3,"2019-03-30 14:55:19",135,419,0

"37744771","Ordered for strawberry pancakes for delivery. The pancakes looked like they were made by a child. All ill and differently shaped. They did not even give the honey separately. So the pancakes were soggy when they arrived. The parcel was delivered without cutlery. And the pancakes were damn sweet. Over all very average food and bad packaging ",2,"2019-03-16 11:25:10",4,0,0

"66599143","Was very much excited after finding this good health conceptual food n beverages and ordered with good expectations""green slimming smoothie"" . Well it took about 20 more mins for preparation which I felt much time. Mainly when I received the order was utterly disappointed with the quality of glass and light packing which absolutely has spilling issues if it's not upgraded to good quality of packing. Compare to others it has less quantity at this price range. Taste of smoothie not upto the mark after having some portion taste buds got powdery origins which disgusts.",1,"2019-02-15 03:53:48",10,2,1
