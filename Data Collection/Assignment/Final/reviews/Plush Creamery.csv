Hey guys here am with the new desert menu review , at Plush Creamery . This place is already getting hyped with its unique way of  waffles and icecreams etc., They surely gonna beat up soon in the city . 
Ambience :-  The place is spacious enough for around more than 30 , they have decorated there walls with some  arts with lots of colours and the seating they added some creative where they kept a tractor kinda seating, really unique 5‚≠êÔ∏è. 
Waffles :-  Waffles here are the best they might not be so appealing to our eye but they taste amazing . The softness of the waffle is so smooth that it just melts away so soon , and its so light that u really forget the count of waffles ur eating . U just continously hog and u wont realise how much actually you are having  , by this u can know how well they are cooked . 
My favs :- Strawberry cheesecake waffle 5‚≠êÔ∏è
Blueberry cheesecake waffle 5‚≠êÔ∏è
Here i wanna mention about the nuttela waffle which was given with the dark chocolate icecream the best combination i totally loved it . üòã 5‚≠êÔ∏è
Here comes the summer favourites :- Icecreams üçß
My most favourite and best icecream was Raspberry i loved it so much , it tasted so good there were no sweetners added , the icecream was all about the natural extract of raspberry where you can notice with the first bite itself üòçüòã . Loved eating those chunks of raspberry in between . 5‚≠êÔ∏è
Twirl :- Mango twirl was perfect 5‚≠êÔ∏è
Jamun twirl was too sweet . 
Belgian chocolate twirl was the best loved the chocosticks styling 5‚≠êÔ∏è
Pricing :- Quite reasonable 5‚≠êÔ∏èPlush Creamery",5,"2019-05-18 01:36:10",55,76,27

"36263035","This is a decent ice cream parlour where one can sit hang around as well. It sits among many other such places in the neighbourhood and yet it has managed to hold up on its own. It has some really interesting flavours for ice cream scoops like the black coloured 'Deactivated charcoal with cookies' and the nutella with peanuts something. They also offer couple of different types of cones. All in all a good place but felt the prices were a bit on higher side.",3,"2019-04-11 17:46:53",59,182,2
"45800673","Plush creamery uses 100 percent natural ingredients without any artificial flavours...
What makes this place stand apart from other icecream places is that it has sundaes and soft serves also added to its menu 
The icecreams are real good u can easily taste the pulp and milk in it ...its flavours are rich and 
transparent 
The waffles cones are attractive and are of many different flavours 
The best ice creams what i liked are the roasted chocolate almond and the strawberry...the strawberry icecream has like lots of  fruit in it 
The activated charcoal ice cream is also a must try here
The banana split in sundaes stole my heart ....it was sooo good 
The service  of the place is good and its nice place to stop by for an icecream or twoinstagram.com",4,"2019-04-04 04:55:02",111,3129,7

Plush Creamery, a Hyderabad born brand is slowly making it's footprints count with some great collection of flavours trying to edge over the competitive market. Apart from their regular ice creams, their USP is off course the Twirls, Shales and Sundaes.
There waffle creations are also taking some serious attention.
However, they need to work more on innovations to get new flavours and creations.bongfooodie.com",4,"2019-03-31 11:42:48",129,2409,3
"33999738","I went to the plush at Gachibowli with foodie group for a session.
The place is very nice. It is big!
They really have so many awesome flavors of fresh ice-creams without any artificial substances added.
I really liked - desi chikki, blueberry cheesecake, charcoal, red velvet so much.
Death by chocolate and Banana split sundae were very nice.
I really enjoyed ice-creams here. Do visit them!
Thanks _thefoodtrip_ for hosting!",5,"2019-03-31 11:28:36",31,684,3
"49437288","_thefoodtrip_ was kind enough to invite us to try out Plushcreamery 's delicious ice-creams.
They claim to use 100% natural ingredients which they source from around the world, and which makes their ice creams rich in texture and flavour.
We started off with a chocolate-vanilla soft serve in a red velvet cone. Which wasn't just rich but also had a very balanced sweetness. We opted to top it off with some choco chips. Though there were sprinkles and chocolate dip as options too.
Then we tried their Mint-Chocolate and Red Velvet Cream Cheese. We strongly recommend these two.! They were absolutely delicious.
While the mint chocolate was very flavourful and fresh. Red Velvet Cream Cheese (made with mascarpone) was very light and rich.
Other flavors which we liked were Tiramisu and Desi Chikki (very very unique and delicious).
Another thing we tried is their PinaColada Twirl. It had fresh cut pineapples, some colorful biscuits, vanilla soft serve and coconut concoction. It was light and had a balanced taste.
They also serve bubble waffles with ice cream and whipped cream. We didn't want to miss out on it, so we tried one of that too.
Although we tried a lot of things, because the sweetness wasn't overwhelming, we didn't feel saturated with the products, which is surprising cause we tend to steer clear from sugary stuff.
So over all, we'd say, it was a good experience.‚ú®",4,"2019-03-26 00:02:20",134,1050,4
"51385400","Was really excited to see and eat the chocolate balls along with brownie pieces as shown in pic for Dark Chocolate twirl. But sadly that wasn't the case. The ice creams are served in plastic glasses so of course the quantity is enough for even two. It's just like a cone concept where the chocolate disc is on top and rest is the ice cream. The disc here was made up of chocolate, chocolate chips, Badam. Ice cream was very good in taste and in between there are small surprises of chunks of chocolate chips. Good packing. Regular plastic spoon. Would definitely go for other items with a hope that I'd be receiving exactly as shown in pics.",3,"2019-03-22 15:44:48",60,16,4
"32779743","Plush Creamery claims to use 100% milk and natural ingredients with no addition of any artificial flavors in their ice creams. This is a relatively new outlet at Gachibowli, has bright lighting and good seating area. They serve a variety of flavors of ice creams including natural fruit flavors, Sundaes, Twirls and Shakes.
We tried scoops of Activated Charcoal with cookies, Strawberry, Desi Chikki, Tiramisu, Blueberry cream cheese and Custard apple served in both cones and cups. Of these I liked Desi Chikki and Custard apple, the scoop of Desi Chikki had a delicious strong flavor of chikki while the Custard apple one had a subtle natural aftertaste of Custard apple. We had two servings of Strawberry, the first one had a solid texture but the second one was creamy so consistency of the scoops can be improved. Activated Charcoal did have a good creamy texture and tasted great.
They serve a variety of Twirls and you have an option to create your own Twirl too. We had Pina Colada Twirl, like the classic cocktail, Pina Colada had coconut and pineapple flavor, can try this if you like coconut flavored ice-cream. Among shakes we had Caf√© Mocha and Belgian Chocolate Brownie, the second one tasted great with chunks of Brownie in it.
Overall this is a good place to hangout for some good natural ‚Äúcreamy‚Äù ice-creams.",4,"2019-03-21 22:37:19",169,1259,10
"52169296","One more favorite ice cream joint added to my list after cream stone and naturals. The ice cream I ordered today was choco fudge twirl and it was really balanced.

"33768081","Plush Creamery has one of the best ambiances where I went with bunch of my foodie friends by invite.
This is nearby Karachi Bakery (nearest landmark) and would find a little issue with parking. 
We had tried couple of Shakes, Sundaes, Twirls and below are some of the above which I liked:
Shakes:
Litchi Shake: One of the best I have tasted in a long time with fruit flavours. It had a whole litchi too at the top of the shakes which added special trim to the shake.
Roasted Hazelnut Blast: As the name suggests, it was full of chocolate, Hazelnut and chocochips. One of the best mind 
Sundaes: 
Death By Chocolate: You name it and it has. Chocolate Icecream, Brownie, Choco chips, Chocolate sauce. This is heaven on earth ! And definitely on Plush Creamery.
Twirls:
Banana: Oh my my ! I love Bananasssssssss and this made me love it even more. Wonderful it is.
Kitkat: The people not in love with Kitkat will also be going to order this on their second order. This is on my repeat.

The twirl didnt have much of brownie or choc sauce or chips..., heavy on icecream. Would have given an addditional star if brownie and sauce was good amount. No dry fruits nor any choc balls.
For blueberry cheesecake icecream it was good not great or spectacular, tasted more vanilla base than blueberry or cheesecake.
At minimum put the ingredients that is committed on the menu !",3,"2019-02-10 15:21:07",38,43,2

"33769278","Plush launched their latest outlet in Indra nagar Gachibowli which is the biggest one of all their outlets. I was here with a bunch of foodies for a review session. The menu consists of variety of icecreams, twirls and shakes.
To start off with, we have tried their soft-serve ice-cream. It came in a waffle cone and topped with Chocolate sauce, Nuts and chocolate bytes which gives you a another level of ice-cream experience.
You can have different flavours from the menu as per your choice.
-->Sundaes:
- Death by chocolate: The bottom is filled with chocolate ice cream and topped with Chocolate bytes, nuts, brownie, sticks and an ice-cream. Worth trying!
-->Twirls:
Dry fruit, Banana Chocolate and KitKat were the ones we tried. Dry fruits and KitKat ones were best and the quantity justified the price, too.
Ending with series of ice creams scoops: We have tried
Desi Chikki, cookies and cream, Banana caramel, pink gauva to name a few which were added newly along with existing flavours. All the ice creams were natural in taste without being added additional flavour. Each scoop costs 70 ‚Çπ which is VFM.
-->Shakes:
We have tried Choco hazelnut, Cafe mocha and litchi all of them seemed to be improved from our previous session. Specially loved the hazelnut one.
Overall a pocket friendly dessert outlet. If you are craviy for a dessert, do stop by this place for their icecreams and twirls.

"30883441","Plush creamy ice cream opened new outlet and it is as good as the other ones. I went there with my friends and we ordered lot of ice cream and loved it even more.
So we ordered
Single scoops first which were chocolate hazelnut, chikki, raspberry and all we're good with right amount of sweetness in this but the most taste catching was chikk, it was something new and wonderful.
Then we tried few shakes which were banana twirls, cafe mocha, chocolate hazelnut and litchi shake. All shake were good but I loved the litchi and chocolate hazelnut the most, they were outstanding.
We also tried pistachio scoop on red velvet. It was yummy.
We also tried KitKat twirls and believe me it's the yummiest and must try.
So overall this place is very cool, pocket friendly, and with lots of variety. Ice cream lovers must try this one.",5,"2019-01-31 17:04:09",60,120,6
"39216844","Went to this place with my foodie friends a few days ago.
Totally loved the ambience of the place. It was a cozy well lit up place for family and friends to hang out.
We started off by trying the different flavours. They let you do that before you select the flavour of your choice.
They give you in cups and waffle cones.
I personal loved the raspberry and badam malai very much compared to other flavours.
They have this new concept of Twirls where they mix 2-3 flavours and so many topping to make a totally different awesome new ice cream.
Service was fast and on point.
Highly recommend this place to all",5,"2019-01-31 11:29:22",180,1896,4
"4532951","Plush finally have a stand-alone outlet of their own, and it is visible and how! In the line of food joints in Indi a Nagar, near Karachi Bakery, you see the word ""plush"" shining bold and bright. And Sunday evening, bearing the rain and the cold, we reached the place for a review session.
The ambience makes you feel like a kid in candyland. But there's also a sober seating option by the glass, overlooking the busy road.
Right, on to what we tried.
‚àÜ Soft-serve
‚Ä¢ Chocolate soft-serve üç¶- Popped in a freshly made waffle cone, you get scoop of their handcrafted chocolate ice-cream, topped with Nutties, choco bytes, and chocolate sauce. ü§§
‚àÜ Twirls
Twirls are their special creations, handed to you in their signature Plush paper glasses. We tried Banana Twirl üçå (me no like banana, so me no taste this) and Chocolate Twirl, besides the followings two.
‚Ä¢ Dry Fruit Twirl ‚ú® - This has always been a favourite. As the name suggests, it is loaded with almonds, cashews, raisins and what not, with a drizzle of honey on the top.
‚Ä¢ KitKat Twirl üç´ - This was another ‚ú®. Not only did it come with KitKat bits, there were again Nutties, chocolate sauce and choco sticks adorning this dessert. ‚ù§Ô∏è
‚àÜ Sundaes
‚Ä¢ Death By Chocolate - Always the obvious choice. In a glass goblet, there were 2 scoops of ice-cream, lots and lots of brownie pieces, choco-sticks, choco bytes, Nutties and chocolate sauce. Your complete chocolate meal in a glass, basically .‚ú®
‚àÜ Shakes
‚Ä¢ Litchi Shake - This one came with a desseded litchi floating on the top. But this one didn't meet the expectations, somehow.
‚Ä¢ Cafe Mocha Shake ‚òï - Loved this one for the hint of coffee, and not being overtly sweet. ‚ú®
‚Ä¢ Roasted Hazelnut Blast - Another good one, if you're a fan of the flavour.
‚àÜ Handcrafted Ice-creams
These are probably the things you'll notice first when you enter. The array of their self-crafted ice-creams is sure to make you put your nose to the glass and go ""I want all of these!"". Some of the unusual and exquisite flavours I tried were Dry Fruit Chikki, Pink Guava, Cheesecake, Honey Almond and some more. They are soon going to put these out in tubs for sale. The best thing about these ice-creams is that the sugar quantity does not kill the actual flavour, and you'd relish that.
Bottom line - Now that they're so accessible, you should definitely visit them. The taste and quality is a steal for the price. ",4,"2019-01-31 11:12:44",150,2105,0
"15102371","New outlet opened at Indira Nagar. Have tried plush creamery ice cream and amazing twirls at both the outlet at Kukatpally and DLF, it was amazing. Visited this new outlet on last Sunday evening with my foodies gang to try their amazing twirls and ice cream and didn't disappointed.
Have tried their single scoop in cup and Chocolate hazelnut, Chikki üåü, cookies & chips and raspberries were of the best one. Specially Chikki is outstanding, best thing is the ice creams are not overly sugared.
KitKat Twirls - As usual, the best. Loved it to the core.
Banana Twirls - For all the banana lovers, it's pure delight.
Cafe Mocha shake and chocolate hazelnut shake was outstanding. It was again balanced sugar but quite filling.
Litchi shake - Litchi shake was amazing, another üåü. It was prepared using litchi ice cream which is created by using litchi pulps and it gives the original flavour to the shake. Somehow I liked shake much better than the ice cream alone.
Pistachio scoop in red velvet cone was some new combination which we tried but was decent and the old combination of chocolate ice cream with some butties was outstanding.
Overall we had an amazing time and must visit place for all the Ice cream lovers. Tastewise its quite amazing and those people who don't like too much sugar in their ice cream and kept original should visit this place. Price wise its quite nominal as the single scoop will cost only 70 bucks and many new flavours. Will love to visit again for their amazing twirls.

"2721394","We were invited for a food tasting session at Plush Creamery‚Äôs brand new outlet at Gachibowli. The budget friendly caf√© is great for get together where one can quench their thirst for great ice cream creations.
HAND CRAFTED ICE-CREAMS:
The double scoop ice cream served in a chocolate cone with Pista and Badam Kulfi ice creams had bits of nuts giving it a crunchy bite to the otherwise creamy delicious ice cream. The Chocolate ice cream then served topped up with chocolate chips and chocolate sauce drippings added extra punch to the ice cream.
My favourites were Roasted Hazelnut , Chikki ,Banana Caramel and Fudge Brownie.
SUNDAES:
Out of the classic sundaes we choose the sinful Death by Chocolate that was filled with chocolate waffles, brownies, chocolate balls, chocolate chips with a base of chocolate ice cream and loaded with drippings of chocolate sauce.
TWIRLS:
The signature twirls were next on the list; with the dark chocolate twirl from Chocolate creation had chocolate ice cream filled with gooey brownie, crunchy crackers and chocolate balls. The Kit-Kat twirl had chocolate ice cream with wafers, kit-kat pieces and chocolate sauce drippings. My favourite from the Fruit Creation section was the banana twirl topped with caramel sauce on banana caramel ice cream and filled with banana chunks and cashew nuts. From the Nutty Creations section, we tried Dry Fruits Twirl, which was filled with almonds, raisins and cashew nuts paired with dry fruit ice cream.
SHAKES:
Caf√© Mocha and Choco Hazelnut Blast from their shakes section were thick, flavourful and deliciously filling. Litchi lake from fruit shakes section topped with frozen litchi is a must order for fruit lovers.

The new stand alone store that has opened at Gachibowli in the high street has a splendid and vibrant ambience, extremely spacious, with good service and an elaborate menu!!! They serve one of the best ice cream scoops and twirls and just make your ice cream experience truly enjoyable. Fudge brownie, Pink guava and Chikki have been their new additions to the menu and are just out of the world!!! Their chocolate, custard apple red velvet and banana have always been my all time favourites!!! 
Have never been disappointed with them and highly recommend this place, as its not just about the flavours but the icing on the cake is their all natural composition with no vegetable fat!!!

"33376100","New place alert!
Plush creamery now has a new address in Gachibowli. This is their third outlet, which is so much bigger and better.
I've been there recently for a session. They are serving ice-creams, sundaes, twirls, softserve and shakes.
They have wide range of flavors, all of them made from natural ingredients in a cream base.
From the ice-creams, I've tried - Custard apple, black forest, cranberry, blueberry cream cheese, desi chikki, coffee, Belgian chocochip, red velvet cream cheese, fudge brownie, cookies & cream. I did like all of them. But if I had to pick my favorites, it will definitely be - Desi chikki, black forest, red velvet and custard apple. These flavors are a must try when you visit them.
I also tried sundaes and twirls - death by chocolate, dry fruit twirl and pina colada twirl. Death by chocolate was very good. I personally did not like pina colada. It just tasted like pineapple. There was no hint of coconut flavor in it.
Also the soft serve is too good here. A bit expensive from the regular but it is amazing.
From the shakes, I've tried - lychee and Strawberry.
I liked lychee shake a lot. Even the strawberry shake was good.
If you're looking a very spacious ice-cream place with not only amazing ice-creams but also shakes, sundaes and twirls, this one is for you. You'll not regret visiting them. ",4,"2019-01-17 14:38:20",260,3287,3
"33536593","Plush Creamery, a new ice cream and dessert parlor gaining popularity in the city expanded to their newest and rather large outlet, among many other restaurants and joints along the same road.
The ambience was plain, very bright interiors and nothing much done to it. A colorful wall looked out of place but was still adding a nice touch.
Tried out their numerous ice cream flavors, a lot of options to choose from. Personally, I liked the roasted hazelnut, chikki, coffee, lychee and fudge brownie. Didn't quite like the sitaphal but everyone else seemed to disagree with me, so you be the judge. The ice creams were made well, with natural ingredients and flavors, minus excessive sweetness. The texture could be improved as they felt powdery and slightly icy.
Their twirls are quite a good concept, a softy blended with a flavor of your choice, topped generously with add-ons. Tried the Pinacolada but was left disappointed, as it tasted like pineapple syrup and nothing else. The presentation and texture need improvement, goes both for the twirl and the toppings (Choco chips were too hard).
To end, I had a Lychee milkshake and though this tasted very artificial, like a blend of lychee syrup and ice cream, it was one of the better items of the evening.
Overall, a good dessert place offering quality products priced well. Alright for a quick stop.",4,"2019-01-15 00:21:46",145,3376,12
