They offer varieties of options for the breakfast. Juices, chocolate shake and honey carrot juice were present for the starters. They have 5-6 options in fruits that are cut in pieces as well as kept whole fruit in the basket too. Chicken salad and cottage cheese salad were amazingly prepared and were healthy options for the breakfast.
Noodles were too sticky and not at all good in taste. Chicken salami, sausage, ham and chicken masala were good. Pav bhaji, vegetable gravy and chicken stew, aloo puri were average but good variety for North Indians. There was only one option for parantha that was paneer parantha. I think they add more options for paranthas. Upma, idli sambhar, masala dosa, poha and kesari baath were good options for south Indian meals.
They have donuts and cupcakes in the flavour of chocolate, honey and strawberry. Overall the experience was great with many varieties of options for people from North to South.",4,"2019-04-28 19:05:34",150,418,7

It had he right mix of spices and an underlying flavor of almonds. Manoj who was serving us makes it even more special. Had a nice time.",5,"2019-02-23 17:10:05",42,62,0
"48375671","I had a breakfast buffet in Zing and i am happy for being charged for the good buffet. A great place for families so kids can pick and choose what they want and go back for 2nds and thirds. I got on my hands on chocolate and almond croissant, pie, doughnuts and strawberry danish. Apart from buffet, i had harissa cottage cheese in appetizers special and painkiller cocktail which was equally as good. Overall a good price for what one get with nice city view and ambience.",4,"2018-10-31 02:14:44",41,135,0
"14811881","Food is a Sentiment for Hyderabadis - Rightly said and i can say that this restaurant has really hurt my sentiments. Coming to the point, been to so many 5 star hotels but never been really satisfied with food - same goes with Radisson Zyng.
To start with the Ambience - Good with petfectly balanced lights and music. FOOD was NOT GOOD. The starters were served on table - Chicken nuggets and Chicken kebab, cold and tasteless. There was a lavish spread with Chinese section, Indian section and Continental sections but nothing was upto the mark. 
All i can say that it was a forgetable experience ðŸ¤§",1,"2018-08-24 00:26:38",21,1347,8

"279147","Went here on a Friday evening after a conference. The place was pretty empty as one would expect as it is in a 5 star hotel. The seating is quite cosy and laid back. I had a couple of beer - Hoegaarden. They did not have much variety in terms of beer. The crispy corn, peanut masala and manchurian were all pretty decent. Would not opt for this place on a regular basis.",3,"2018-02-24 15:41:57",27,423,1

"11880381","Hopped in for a few beers courtesy a deal from nearbuy, which gave me 4 Pints of beer for 500 bucks, while I could have got a better deal in other pubs even without a deal, I was in the mood for a relaxed expeierence in a 5star as opposed to thumping party place, I guess that's how Sundays generally are ! 
The place itself is nice and quaint, given that it's a hotel it was not rushed at all, just a couple of other tables occupied, which mostly consisted of inhouse diners. So that's a good feeling when you need to be away from the crowd.
I got a 6 seater couch all for myself which again is a stunt you can only pull off in a 5 star without being sneered at. 
The beer they served was well beer at the end of the day, so nothing special, just the same. They gave me a namkeen to go.
Would have been great if this place had happy hours all till atleast 10pm, it would be accessible to a lot more people Albeit keeping the crowd in check.
I have been to this Radisson multiple times, and apart from a couple of niggles in the restaurant , there is little or nothing I can complain about.
The bartenerder even offered me the same offer without the nearbuy deal so that's not a bad thing, a bucket of beer for 500 in a 4-5 star, pretty good if oh ask me, especialy when you're looking for a drink in a better place then your local joint. ",3.5,"2017-03-26 21:39:13",116,932,5
"36921836","Basically Zyng is the restrobar of Radisson. The food is good. Unfortunately the drinks are not that good. I have been to radisson of other places but the bars there are much better as compared to this.
The staff is also not very welcoming plus the service is very slow.",3,"2016-12-12 20:33:56",28,67,0
"32779743","The Great World Buffet includes Zyng restaurant too.
It has a bar too and sitting is quite comfortable .
Liked the nachos with guacamole, salsa and red beans.
Service could have been better as refilling of the dishes was taking a lot of time.",3.5,"2016-11-22 15:58:17",169,1259,6
"831269","It was during a recent FIHR event i visisted this place.  its right infront of cascade inside radisson hotel. As it was a foodie event of 130 members cant comment on their service. The thing which was very much awkward for me was they had set up a stall as well outside the bar which looked cheap coming to a place like radisson. Tried their several mocktails which were made very much in hurry.  They were also serving mexican food beside drinks like there was a nacho bar and a couple of mexican dishes among which Mexican kidney bean rice was the best. ",3,"2016-10-15 14:38:14",294,1076,11

If you are music lover and want loud music avoid this place because of the staff even allow to loud music the sophisticated so call customer who are in house guest won't allow cause they want to discuss meeting just beside Dj area . Don't know what's the point . Apart from that everything is cool mast shaandaar.",4,"2016-08-06 18:47:32",18,89,0

"3053087","Zyng --- Its truly a zing thing.
Came to hangout with friends after a rigorous training sessions at the same hotel for the entire day.
Pleasant ambiance and courteous staff contributed to a wonderful evening!
As we wanted to windup soon, the quick bites on the table were french fries, Capsicum Pakoda and Pepper Chicken.
Fries were crisp and soft.... Very finely made. Capsicum pakodas were hot and tasty. Pepper chicken was well garnished and aptly fried!
Many more things to try in my next visit...mysticalfoodie.com",3.5,"2015-09-26 20:54:37",211,1366,0
"846272","A very classy & Ã¼ber bar 
Had a wonderful time here as we were here for a business meeting and coffee evening time.
Very upscale ambiance with a big screen TV that will host all your sports fancies. Has come wonderful food and ended with coffee and cookies.
They have a beautiful cigar lounge which is one of a kind that I have seen in a star hotel, must visit on a Saturday night or afternoons.
Looking forward for hosting a classy evening with some scotch buddies of mine at this bar.

"903197","Very bad food..was here for lunch and was disappointed . There were variety but nothing was good. Not many starters and they are serving naan which is not so fresh and when asked for hot naans it took ages to get 1 . I would strongly tell ppl not to visit this place but may be you can try the other restuarents here. ",1,"2015-07-05 14:43:10",22,86,1

The music could bw better as they are playing Kenny G or pipe music for a lounge area which is abit outdated for a modern hotel. ",4.5,"2015-05-13 15:26:42",241,843,0
"16130131","To avoid the terrible traffic of Hyderabad my friend and I decided to explore the nearest joint in the vicinity of Hitechcity. Radisson impressed us with its ambiance, the presence was felt, it was cool, calm , we strolled in the hotel & latter decided to go to Zyng and have some Chinese, I found the staff to be friendly, however I found it odd when the server said he got to check if they got broccoli to serve one particular dish, latter when we changed our mind and asked him if he could get mushroom he said he will get back, this was something that we weren't expecting, the server wasn't sure about the availability of the dishes, but he did help us which is appreciated, after waiting for couple of minutes we weren't fascinated with the food, the food was good nothing dazzled us though. I would like them to improve on the quality, and experiment with their menu.",2,"2015-02-03 10:40:08",2,1,0
"688206","Another awful experience. Went for team dinner, food was disappointing, nothing was fresh. Service was bad, there was no refill of exhausted items. Variety was so less for the price 750+ tax for buffet. Please don't visit this place.",1,"2014-07-19 08:04:46",8,19,0
