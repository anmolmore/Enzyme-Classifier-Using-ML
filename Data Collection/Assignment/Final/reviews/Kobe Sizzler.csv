"131848","A good variety of menu especially for vegetarians. The wide variety confuses what to choose, but Suhail just makes it easy. He understands the taste the customer wants and suggests the dishes. The recommendation by him was Vegetable sizzler and a Mushroom and Cheese sizzler. The mushrooms were really seasoned well and had a great after taste. Highly recommended for Mushroom lovers!!. My friend and I are really happy and satisfied with the food and service. Kindly do come to this place. Best place to have sizzlers in Hyderabad. And when in doubt, always ask Suhail. ",5,"2019-05-12 22:03:32",3,2,0
"1308988","This place is co-existing with Shanghai Chef another chinese chain..its nothing like,if you been to any other Kobe chain . sizzler is overpriced for ambience. Restaurant is under staffed effecting service. Two franchisee in same retaurant dilutes brand of each.
Only good part is food taste, lives up to Kobe standard. Vegeterian ok. ",2,"2019-05-12 02:39:07",69,66,0
"2985206","Its the fame of Film Nagar Kobe sizzlers that bought me here. This is a little confusing place to begin with as they share the space with Shanghai Chef. As a result, it is crowded and a good ambience is out of the window. Be very mindful about the parking limitations as the street where the restaurant is located is very narrow and crowded at night.
The food was rather not up to mark. We ordered two sizzlers and neither matched our expectations. Add that to the relatively slow (not unbearable) service. In short, not that great of an experience. Sorry to say, but not coming back here. ",3,"2019-05-11 23:09:10",14,5,1
"69354023","The Veg Sizzler here is just above average. Didn’t really like the noodles in the sizzler, rice option is still better. Don’t really know about the non-veg options.",3,"2019-05-11 22:15:06",2,1,0
"659713","I just loved the food here. We were a group of 8, is I almost tasted most of the sizzlers and trust me all of them are unique and good. Every one of us liked the food. But the ambience is something which is not good. It is in the Shanghai Chef restuarant itself and due to low maintenance the place looks very very average. Would be better if they improve it.

"30771454","The restaurant is located in a busy place Vinayak Nagar , Gachibowli.
They have collaborated with Shanghai chef recently.
The place is small with limited seating so it's better to reserve a table in weekends before a visit. The ambience is okayish.
We ordered Toridiango and Hokkaido chicken sizzler with noodles.
Even though the preparation of the patty, french fries and veggies were good in sizzlers, the noodles was very bland spoiling the taste of the whole sizzler. Both the sizzlers needed seasoning.
However kobe sizzler is well famous. Would maybe try with rice next time but they need to improve with their sizzler preparation with noodles.",3,"2019-04-15 00:54:25",29,72,1
"32509115","And Finally, Kobe Sizzler is here in Cyberabad.
I had been dying for a good Sizzler place to open up in this part of the city.
Kobe Sizzler is as good as it gets here in the city.
Being a national brand, they do maintain good standards.
I tried their crab meat soup, the Kobe Special Chicken Sizzler, Lamb Shashlik sizzler and a Veg sizzler.
The soup and both the Non-veg Sizzlers very quite good.
The shashlik was perfect. The lamb meat balls were divine.
My vegetarian friends however were not very impressed. So, maybe they can improve on their Vegetarian menu.
But, I personally had a very good experience, eating at Kobe.",5,"2019-04-12 12:33:10",117,980,3

"16100018","I went in with 10 of my friends and had a blast. The Sizzler's were amazing! The hospitality was great. Suhail was a great host and personally looked after our requests.
And To be honest after ordering mindlessly, we had a lavish dinner under budget. Totally worth it.
They can probably improve on the Ambience!
Other than that, a really good place.",5,"2019-04-06 13:25:50",78,510,0
"16012287","I have tried Kobe's sizzled previously at Bangalore, and this was my first visit to Hyderabad branch.
Although I ordered veg sizzler(Never my first choice though in sizzler) and Honey chilli potato, however, I must commend the chef, as my taste buds were satisfied.
Good service ( though it could have been faster therefore only 4 stars).
Plus point for IPL fans, they are streaming the matches also on a big projector.

"125714","Sizzler, originally from Japan is teppanyaki styles dish which rose to popularity in 1950’s. It’s essentially a meat based dish that is seared at a high-temperature to a crispy texture outside and is left moist from inside. With the growing demand among patrons, it is customised and made with Vegetables and Paneer as well. Served with steamed vegetables, a side of French fries/Potato wedges, choice of Rice/Noodles it forms a meal in itself. 
A dish which is supposed to be enjoyed at leisure as the contents are served in a hot iron plate encased in a wooden frame. If the wiki has to believed, Sizzler was first introduced by Mr. Firzon Erani in his restaurant “The Sizzler” and was soon inspired by other outlets such as Kobe who is now branched out to International locations as well.
The second branch of Kobe in Hyderabad is managed by the same enterprising and humble personality Mr. Suhail. While eating Sizzlers is an gastronomical experience, meeting SuhRac (as he is fondly called) is another who is a benchmark of great hospitality. His generosity and modest attitude of receiving guests and strangers with a warmth would definitely make you to come back for more.
I was here with my Team of 35 members to feast on Sizzlers and though it took a bit longer time to serve each of them but the entire Lunch turned out to be a great affair at the end. 
We vegetarians tried their Signature and Paneer Steak versions. Signature true to its name was more enjoyable due to large chunks of grilled paneer nicely roasted to a crusty base but still soft from within nestled with vegetables resting on a mount of rice and side of Potato Wedges finished off with sauce. For someone who enjoy a bit of more flavor, ask for extra quantity of garlic sauce as I found it to be insufficient. Few of my team members, trying for the first time were fascinated to the smell and sound of the sauces dribbling on the hot iron plate as it reached their tables.
Before the Mains, our taste-buds were welcomed by Mongolian Soup, a thin broth perfumed with flavours and abundant with fresh veggies. Chilly baby corn was equally delicious with those quintessential curry flavours and crunch of fritters. 
For few of them who were not very comfortable with the idea of eating those grilled and steamed stuff from the hot iron plate, were pampered with multiple versions of Fried Rice and Noodles. 
The eggless Brownie, so rich and decadent, with pleasantly bitter after-taste have my heart. I was surprised at the taste and texture as its quite rare to find such well made brownies.
The ambience is nothing fancy but comfortable to enjoy Lunch and Dinners. The quality and quantity coupled with ongoing Zomato Gold makes it a stellar option for someone who wants to try a different cuisine out of their comfort zone.",4,"2019-04-03 14:39:29",149,1676,3
"194818","Visited this place for the second time last Saturday. The first time I visited this place was disappointing. Second visit was a pleasant one.
The mutton soup was tasty.
The Lamb Shashlik was tender and juicy.
Nasi Goreng was overstuffed with rice but the flavour was good.
Szechuan and Chilly chicken sizzlers were good.
The mocktails were just okay. Fruit punch was probably the best one.
Overall a worth visiting place for sizzler lovers.",4,"2019-04-02 18:29:31",5,2,0

We had the red chilly Lamb sizzler, Hokkaido chicken sizzler, chicken sizzler with garlic sauce and the Kobe signature sizzler. They have a option of rice or noodles to go with the sizzlers and I personally would opt for the rice. The veg starters were also good. It is a nice little cosy place with really good food.

"578289","This place has AMAZING sizzlers - probably the best one I've had in a really long time, and definitely the best sizzler in Hyderabad. Suhail, who served us, recommended the Kobe signature and Roasted chili lamb sizzlers. Both were out-of-the-world yummy! It's a small and cozy place that shares the seating area with Shanghai Chef.

"51999296","I was at Kobe Gachibowli last evening to enjoy sizzler. We were a group of 12 and we thoroughly enjoyed the food. Suhail demonstrated great customer obsession right from helping us park the cars to the time we said bye. I have like Sizzlers and I have been to Kobe at BLR Brigade. However, Gachibowli being at stone throw away distance, it is a treat. We loved the food, kids loved starters and sizzlers were great, of course followed by Sizzler Brownie. The only things Suhail may want to work on in near future is to give his place a bit more fancy look. Cheers. Thanks to Suhail again. ",5,"2019-03-17 10:08:24",2,1,0

"16284586","The first time when I had a visit to Kobe's was when I was in Kochi. So when Kobe's opened in Hyderabad ( Film Nagar), we had to visit and indeed it was amazing.
Since I stay near Gachibowli area, I was really hoping for a branch near Gachibowli and it did happen.
On Valentine's Day when we were searching for places, I stumbled upon Zomato's newly opened list and seeing Kobe's in Gachibowli was a huge surprise.
We had called and booked the table but when we reached there, it was so crowded and they did not have proper reservation mechanisms and people were just jumping on to the chairs that just got emptied. We were disappointed. After waiting for almost 40 minutes we got a seat and the food took another 30 minutes.
The food nonetheless was amazing that day.
So this was like my 4th visit after that day and it was never crowded since then.
The sizzlers they offer are the best I had in Hyderabad. Even comparing to the Film Nagar branch.
We ordered :
1. Kobe Signature Veg sizzler - A speciality of this sizzler is that you get both rice and noodles with this and it has a tangy tomato flavour to it - 4/5
2. Chicken Satellite sizzler - As mushroom sauce is one of my favorite choices, this is my favorite sizzler from the menu - it has mushroom sauce along with cheese and cream, which makes it so mouth watering - 4/5
3. Vegetable Spring Roll - Even though am not a fan of veg starters or bites, these got my attention. They were nicely flavoured and had an amazing filling - 4/5
4. Grass Hopper - Drink - I actually like the grass Hopper at their film Nagar branch better - 3.5/5
Overall -4/5
Definitely a must try if you are a fan of sizzlers. ♥️",4,"2019-03-16 14:17:30",22,90,2
"49630916","With the name Kobe ,gets back the memories of Kobe Mumbai’s sizzlers And that’s what attracted wandering palate to Kobe’s . 
Though this one is merged with Shanghai chef restaurant which has a average ambience . 
Suhail is a great host with extremely fair  knowledge of the food and well versed with the presentation functioning around the restaurant . 
However V were not very happy with the sizzler as I ended up comparing to Kobe’s other Branches outside hyderabad . I felt the garlic sauce lacked the authenticity the punch and the portion size was very very less  . 
Thou the nasi goreng turned out above average .

"1265234","Been to this place for dinner once and was disappointed with the food. A forgetful experience to say the least.
We had ordered a soup, a starter, and of course Sizzlers as our main course. The place has no ambiance, the music was decent, the food was blah!
The soup (Tom yum goong, I am unsure of the name) was amazing, which was a good start. But things very slowly (much like their Pace of service) went downhill with the starter. We'd ordered Classic fish and chips, to say the very least it was bland (no salt or any other condiments were added to it) and the fish stank.
Sizzlers - we had ordered 2 of them, the prawn one and the fish one. Sadly enough both tasted pretty much the same, forgetful.
Food - 2/5 (just because the soup was amazeballs)

"285441","Had a very forgetful experience at Kobe. Usually Kobe is well known for their spread of steaks and sizzlers across the country, having visited their outlets in Pune and Bangalore, I had a set standard of how the food will be, unfortunately was let down in Hyderabad. We had ordered a starter of fish and chips and a Hokkaido sizzler with rice and fries. The fish and chips were horrible, outright sad, no salt, no condiments, absolutely bland (no salt kind, not continental kind), somehow they managed to not put salt in both the fish fillet and the batter, beats me how though. The sizzlers were relatively better off, but then again no steak knives. We had to manage with a butter knife to eat the meat, which was again lacking in salt. The sauce wasn't as good as I remember, but the meat was nice and juicy. Pretty sure we won't be going back again. I think a major issue is the fact that this place isn't a steak joint, but a Chinese restaurant serving Kobe's menu. It is lacking in proper ventilation and requisite cutlery to support a steak and sizzler menu. Perhaps they should look into it else most Kobe enthusiasts might just skip this place entirely after the first time. ",2,"2019-03-10 09:54:27",11,136,0

Speaking about the food, we ordered a fish shashlik sizzler which was perfectly cooked and tasted like the sea, but was of no match to the Roasted Chilli Lamb sizzler. Its a dish you'd always remember having.

"1202564","Okeydokey! Kobe! The sizzle house! Where do i start from. Okey!
So i've heard about Kobe many times in the past, have been waiting to go to the other branch at Filmnagar, but then today was the day. Just opened the Zomato App and checked for newly opened Restaurants @Gachibowli and here i see, Kobe! WOW! 
I go there. I see its a small place. Just right for a decent foodies to get in. Promptly seated! Just two of us. I had made up my mind what to eat. The other friend was a first timer on Sizzler. Ordered a Veg Chilly Paneer and a Kobe Signature Non-Veg Sizzler. And while we were waiting i see this person roaming around, could make out he owns it or he might be the main guy there. So i ask him ""Hey, when did this branch open"" ... ""We opened this on 1st of Feb"" ... and we began talking. 
That is Sohail. Who had the Master franchise of Kobe Sizzler, and i must say, it's in the right hands. I've tried Sizzlers in many places in Hyd, there are honestly just a couple of them who do it the right way. We know Indijoe was one big player and it completely nose dived recently. But this place, to tell you how much i enjoyed it, I'll ask you to check one of my photos i posted in this review, the one with the empty base, thats how much i enjoyed it. I hadn't cleaned the sizzler base ever before like that anywhere.
You see, eating sizzler is a thing you need to do when you have time. When you are hungry and have the patience to let the flavour of the smoked cooked veggies and rice get to your taste buds. It's hot, it's tasty and you cant gobble on it. You cant sit there and ask them to make it fast, you eat it slow & it's also prepared with lot of care. It needs to taste right, or you wont like it.
Sohail was very nice to us and served us a drink i guess that wasn't on the menu and that's his recipe, i name it ""Twisted Chocolade"" hehe, Chocolate, Lemonade and what not, it was nothing like i tasted before. Was very kind of him to compliment us with it.
All and all this place Sizzles and how. Be patient, go there, sit, eat, indulge. Ahhh! Exquisitely enchanting lunch! Thank you!",5,"2019-02-22 14:45:54",54,68,6

The good old Shanghai Chef 2 has now merged with Kobe Sizzlers to provide you with a varied range of sizzlers and some other dishes.
The ambience now is a mixed up combo of chinese ambience along with the touch of Kobe's global ambience here and there. The place is located in the hustling street of Indira Nagar (Gachibowli) on the first floor.
The disappointment initially was they didn't have the signature French onion soup. So for starter we ordered the Singapore Chilly Paneer. The dish was a slight spin off to the regular Chilly Paneer, because of the tinge of Singapore sauce. The taste was a perfect balance between sweet spicy and tanginess, however it was slightly bland but I would recommend it.
Next up was the Kobe Special Sizzler priced at Rs.529 was a bit pricy. The quantity is sufficient just for a person or at max two, it has 250 grams of paneer, 250g of veggies and another quarter kg of rice/noodles. The sizzler is served with both noodles and rice along with some spinach, veggies and a minute quantity of fries. Before coming to the taste I would suggest ask to make the sizzler bit more saucy as the paneer otherwise would be bland and ask for some more fries or mashed potatoes instead. They offer quite a few sauce dips like garlic sauce which helped us enhance the flavor of the sizzler. The paneer was extremely tender and rice and noodles perfectly blending with the saucy paneer. The taste was decent and became good after the addition of garlic sauce.
Next up from the Chinese kitchen was the Schezwan Pan Fried Noodles, this was truly one of the best pan fried noodles I have had in town. The noodles were perfectly fied and the sauce was having just the right amount of veggies and thickness. The taste was adjusted to our pallete by reducing the spice a bit. The quantity of noodles is again just right for one hungry person. This is truly recommended.
A special mention to Suhail who came to us in rescue and suggested the perfect dishes to order and made sure that the visit was worthwhile.
To all those reading so far make sure you reach this place before February ends so that you can use up the Dineout coupons.
