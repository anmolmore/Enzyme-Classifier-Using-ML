"36894977","Placed an order for Chettinad Chicken with partottas. Amazing experience with them, specially with packaging part. Also, if I'll talk about Quality - Chicken gravy was decent enough with nice flavor.
Would love to order again from this outlet. ",5,"2019-01-05 10:35:31",59,2065,0

"87059917","Good home delivered and the food was delicious. Chicken Chettinard was tasty not too spicy even if it was made in Andhra style. Perfectly cooked boneless chicken shred in hot spices and curry leaves. The parota was flaky and a good combo with the chicken accompanied with Curd and pickle.",5,"2018-12-24 14:19:20",2,0,0

"33258699","The first time I ordered here, everything in the order was very good. In today's order, I must say that the quantity of sambhar was very less and it did not have the same taste as it was in the first order and there were very less vegetables in sambhar. Secondly, the chutney was not your delicious coconut chutney which I got in the last order but  you have sent roasted Bengal gram chutney (phutana chutney) instead of coconut chutney. The quantity of Upma was also very less compared to my last order with you. Everything was piping hot in my first order but today it wasn't that hot. In view of the great tasting tiffin from you in my last order, I invited my friend for breakfast today.  I was very much looking forward to enjoy the tiffin from your place with my friend but I am really disappointed now because of the taste and quantity as I mentioned above. Please ensure that you maintain the same type of quality, taste and quantity as you did in the past which we greatly appreciated.",4,"2018-05-05 11:43:37",10,1,0
