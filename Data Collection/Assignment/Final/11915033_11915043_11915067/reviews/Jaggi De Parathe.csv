"421488","Ordered the 2 parathas. They were better than average taste. However, I was expecting tava parathas but it ended up being stuffed Tandoori parathas. Never mind.
Packing - Very good
Paratha Taste - Better than average
Chutney had no taste. Tasted like pani puri water
Curd was good.",3,"2019-04-02 14:32:35",56,137,1

"732306","My reviews based just on pranthas.. Dint try anything else.. I ordered aloo methi prantha.. Which was tandoori and good stuffing.. Prantha was heavy and tasty.. Packaging was good enough..",4,"2018-11-25 18:22:17",110,3169,0
"682986","Ordered the vegetarian thali through swiggy. It was a bargain thanks to swiggy offers. Packaging was disappointing and they didn't bother to include a disposal spoon. The plastic covering was quite difficult to take off. Food was good and dal makhani was the best of the lot. Pretty vfm considering you get a stomach filling thali for the price of a curry.

"31917424","I am a true fan of punjabi food. Jassi de paranthe@ hitech city branch is one of the best punjabi outlet Iâ€™ve ever been to. 
But this branch here disappointed me. It was a takeaway I ordered honey chilli potato and Amritsari and onion kulcha with chole curry. Honey chilli potato was amazing. Almost all the starters here taste good. The kulcha werenâ€™t fresh. They were saggy and tasted bland",3,"2018-10-31 21:38:55",110,1196,0
"2494498","Ordered Rajma chawal a couple of times from here. The taste was good, but Rajma could have been more spicy. May decrease or maintain the rating once I've tasted the eponymous Jaggi de Parathe ðŸ˜€",4,"2018-07-24 22:59:07",11,48,0

"54223501","Pros: Good customer service. The food was tasty and delicious. It was a complete punjabi style food.
Cons: The staff should maintain hygiene during cooking as I found hair in the Paneer Tikka I ordered. ",3,"2018-04-30 00:23:48",7,2,0
"53744274","I ordered the kur kur paratha kulcha with chole..it was disaster..the chef can contact me to learn what is kur kur paratha. it was only big and filling. it was not cooked properly and felt like rubber kulcha not good for the stomach.",1,"2018-04-26 21:40:46",2,1,0
"1575466","Ordered Gobi Lasun Cheese paratha combo from the place. It was served with Dal makhani, raita and onions.
The paratha was like sandwich of 2 of paratha with cheese as the filling.
The paratha was damn heavy and tasted really wonderful.
The dal makhani was really good and the quantity was good enough to taste it with the whole paratha.
The paratha is definite try for people who dont mind about weight gain.
Food:4/5
Value for money:3.5/5",4,"2018-02-26 01:09:34",74,1736,0
"45732427","They have pure authentic Punjabi food. Ordered Maharaja thali which was simply yumm. Ambience is pretty cool and good customer service. Must try for the people looking for pure punjabi food around hitech city",3.5,"2018-01-17 17:09:19",21,42,1
"5435371","Went to this place. Excellent food. Was not crowded. The best things to order is chur chur prantha and baigan ka bhadtha. Average ambience but could to overlooked by the taste of food.",5,"2017-11-10 18:57:48",26,54,0
"1686396","The paratha taste was not good. I expected a tawa paratha like other punjabi restraunts but it was tandoori which itself is half baked. The lassi and chach taste very well. Parathas was a disappointment.",2,"2017-11-06 00:59:51",61,80,0
"32706438","I was passing by and thought of ordering food as the name seems too punjabi, so was expecting proper punjabi food.but to my luck the food was disguising, apart from the bitter milk everything seems tasteless. First of all I don't understand why is it called a maharaja meal, which has a starter sized a two rupee Indian coin. Ofcourse I understand you get what you pay for......roti, rice, dal, paneer  curry  were tasteless, paneer was too sweet as though it was dipped in sugar syrup and dal forget about it. On the whole it caused a stomach upset which simply says it's not a right combination of food. Don't recommend to order food from this place. ",1.5,"2017-10-25 14:43:26",16,4,1
"343797","This place once used to my favorite place when it comes to Punjabi food. Yesterday I went there for parcel order and from ordering to eating nothing went well. First of all place is so crowded with people waiting for delivery order and few are struggling to get seats. The owner tried hard to expedite the order but this place really needs a bit more to be organized. Customer is your king and king is not attended properly it may do dark wonders :). 
So here is how my journey started with order, they have 1 billing counter where person handling the billing is so confused about where the item is listed in billing application, It took more than 5 mins just to place order for 2 items. Plus he didn't print the token which is used by the kitchen staff to expedite the orders. I had to wait for another 10 minutes to get my order reach the kitchen. I ordered for aloo paratha and amritsari kulcha and wait time was unexpected.
Now let's talk about food - they claim the parathas are prepared in wheat atta but both amrtisari kulcha and aloo paratha were prepared from maida. Aloo paratha wasn't cooked well because parathas usually here are crispy and this wasn't. The stuffing had a lots of spring onion and mint leaves which was unexpected and didnt blend with taste. 
On the other side the stuffing wasn't tasty and tasted like a frozen food for amrtisari kulcha. The cook was confused to isolate the difference between kulcha and parathas.... Chole had a lot of oil weren't cooked well. They were hard and only taste that one could remember them after eating was garlic. Yes it was enriched with garlic and oil, where the actual masala and chole lost the presence like people singing in chorus. ",2,"2017-10-09 11:07:26",14,44,0
"36495441","Had heard a lot about this place. Ordered aaloo pyaaz paratha combo and was absolutely delighted by the taste. Besides the yummy parathas, they gave raita and salan which were equally good.
Quantity was more than enough and prices are very much affordable.",3.5,"2017-08-24 21:50:31",140,362,2
"931954","I'd have always given this 5 but after today....NO! This is a huge disappointment. The last time and this time how can food change so drastically? We have ordered Methi Aloo paratha which is cut short in size the curd is watery and the vegetable biryani is so bland that it seemed like it's not prepared for human taste buds. This is outrageous. What's wrong guys? My colleagues and I think the Chef's changed. A very huge disappointment from one of my best online foods. Never going back here nor advice anyone to.",1,"2017-08-08 21:51:20",8,201,0
