"50309081","We have been ordering Parathas from here even at night 2 am. Aloo , Paneer , Mix Very Pizza paratha are some of my favs. Additional dishes with it such as Chole ki sabji, curd, achar and butter just add to it. But sometimes we have had bad parathas as well. But mostly thats like 1 out of 10 times. ",5,"2019-05-18 23:00:41",2,8,0

I have ordered haleem oops sorry it was spl. Ghee mutton haleem, but unfortunately due to lack of mutton I guess they sent me spl ghee with Dal.
No where in this world mutton can't be in watery consistency.
Well after this suprise I have contacted customer care, I guess they r really busy other likewise complaints.
I'm attaching all my screen shots & video for your¬†reference.
I also would like to request you to remove this restaurant from Ur app which cannot serve a genuine dish to customer.",1,"2019-05-10 20:57:42",6,3,0

"50931643","Ordered Bhel Puri, Chole Batura and Pani Puri.
Chole Batura was good, liked it.
Didn't like the pani puri, as I was expecting more of a chatpata, tangy flavour. But, it tasted bland.
Bhel Puri was also not upto the mark, it could be better. ",3,"2019-03-14 07:02:16",74,64,1

MLA Dosa üëéüëé it was so bland, no spices at all. There is no masala nor onions and more over ths aloo stuffing is tasteless. I literally felt it like a patient's breakfast. There is nothing special about it. Preferably a BIG NO for this MLA Dosa. ",2,"2019-01-20 17:02:03",39,77,3

"51450312","Worst Worst Worst Worst Worst service ever.
They accepted our order but later when we called the agent he says one of our food items were not available.
Delivery Agent didn't call us for delivery but when we called him he was lying that he called us and we were not reachable.
Delivery Agent is very impolite and reckless and put off the call in middle of the conversation.
I really got a very bad opinion on Zomato and uninstalling this app after writing review. Main reason is due to Swadisht hotel management and below agent.
I suggest to remove these kind of delivery agents.

The thickness of the paratha is almost 1cm and by it you will imagine that it is full of nice stuffing evenly bit here comes the reality, the thickness comes from the floor dough. There is hardly chicken stuffing spread unevenly across and all of it is thick layer of wheat dough which is not cooked properly. The chicken stuffing tasted okayish. They serve paratha with chole, raita, pickle and good dallop of white butter. The chole was bland it tasted like boiled chickpeas. Raita was sour (was not expecting it). The best part all and all was only the pickle. They should improve the quality as they have quite some potential seeing their varied menu. Till then wouldn't order again from here.",2,"2018-05-01 18:05:49",101,530,8
