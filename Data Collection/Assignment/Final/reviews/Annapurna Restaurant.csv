"30934972","The food is good at this restaurant. I would recommend to try either Chinese, North Indian or Biryani. This restaurant is bad in terms of quality of service. In brief, good food and bad service is the USP of this place. Unfortunately, I shall never visit this place due to a bad bad experience in service. ",1,"2019-02-16 00:33:04",23,9,0

They took 1 hour to serve 4 roti & a top billed 6 roti.
No proper response from the managers also.
A very poorly maintained restaurant.",1,"2019-02-08 15:03:03",1,0,0
"34691479","All my rating goes to the amazing food they serve with good service. I have tried Chinese and north Indian, and this is one of the best north Indian food I have had in Hyderabad. Definitely a must try place.
Little less rating for the service, some of the waiters there are rude , who are not ready to clean the tables and stuff, and will make fun and laugh about the same thing with others .
Highly disappointed with the attitude.",3,"2019-02-05 10:14:06",88,187,0

"1697519","Last night went out with my friends to a club and then headed for dinner so this restaurant was on the way.Had some starters from Q Grill and then main course.
There we ordered for Tangdi kebab and Cheese Garlic Broccoli were really lip smacking and then had their Mutton Dum Biryani was tasty with the exact Masala flavor of Hyderabadi.
Apart from all these what we had seen there is they have a different concept i.e. a Drive-in cum Fine Dining restaurant and also multiple outlets of different cuisines like Q Grill,Babu Tiffin's & Snacks,Chinese Aroma,Mr.B'S Burgers,The Dark Stone Ice cream,Ovenz for the Bakery products.
It also has an open garden ambience which is good during the Dinner Time.
Finally a good place to hang out with friends and family and last not the least it is pocket friendly.",5,"2018-11-25 21:05:39",19,1824,4

"34888186","Earlier I had ordered food from this place, it was quite delicious so I decided to visit this place. As per my expectations the food was appetizing. But what defaced the whole event was the service. One of the most pathetic services I have ever received. We had to literally beg for spoons and forks, water and salad. Finally the gave us the incorrect bill.
I would suggest people to take away or order food until the services are improved. 
Service - 0/5
