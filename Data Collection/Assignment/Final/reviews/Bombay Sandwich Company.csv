"57398630","Usually order their chicken banh mi sandwich. Though not an authentic banh mi it's a great chicken sandwich when you want something light for a quick lunch. Good job with the flavour profile. Looking forward to more non veg options I can try ",5,"2019-05-07 14:58:28",6,1,0
"1941036","I ordered a Batata Grilled Sandwich. I am attaching a picture of the description they have for the sandwich and of what i have received.
The description says the sandwich will have veggies, mint chutney and potato. What they have actually put is Masala from MASALA DOSA. It has curry leaves and sarson seeds like in southern India potato masala. Plus there is no mint chutney and only un-peeled cucumbers.
On raising a complaint all that the merchant has to say is that this is the way they prepare the sandwich.
The customers are not fools and these restaurants should stop treating us like one.
Never ordering from this one again!",1,"2019-03-27 19:00:57",3,116,0

"1903288","Ordered the Balle Balle Paneer sandwich and Falafal¬†sandwich along with jal-jeera. On first look while ordering, I found the pricing to be on the higher size. However, i think it was justified given the sandwich size. Both the sandwiches were prepared panini-style with long flatbreads. The fillings were generous and each had distinct taste of its own. You can definitely tell the falafals from the paneers. I have seen at multiple sadnwich restaurants using same sauce as base for their sandwiches which downplays the taste. This didnt do that.¬†
On the taste front, they were generally good but given the price the quantity of the filling could be more. Packaging is perfect to the T and jal-jeera was literally the 'jeera' icing on the cake!

"63618818","We ordered 4 sandwiches from here... First of all , the order was delayed and was delivered 2 hours later. Then we found worms and hair in the sub that we ordered. The worst service and upon calling them, their side was always busy or held up.",1,"2018-08-15 12:22:07",1,0,0
"32610669","I ordered the Spicy aalu sandwich, it was one of the best I had till date. It comes in a Multigrain bread along with other veggies, loved the combo.

"32498244","Firstly, the delivery was delayed by almost 30 minutes with no proper explanation.
Secondly, the Aloo Sandwich is too spicy. Moreover, the fancy beverage named NY caramel coffee shake had nothing to its credit. 
I really liked the sandwiches I ordered previously, but this was a complete disappointment!",2,"2018-07-22 22:58:43",3,56,0

"55387456","I sometimes wonder what should I order that is not unhealthy. Balle Balle paneer sandwich is what I ordered.
Here's what I got:¬†
- Fresh multigrain bread¬†
- Two layers of slightly grilled paneer
- Good Quantity of veggies
- Very less Mayonnaise
Everything was in a proper quantity making it a good meal even if you're looking at your weight. I would prefer that sandwich over Subway anytime(not for taste but for content in it)
The only thing they can improve is to grill that paneer with a little salt and pepper on each side.",5,"2018-06-23 22:50:08",1,1,0
"32451855","The food represented in the pictures is misleading. I ordered the Chicken and caramelized sandwich from Swiggy (also a crap service with subpar restaurants) - first off, the restaurant did not have the item so, i requested for the chicken Bahn Mi.... and THIS is what i got (check picture)¬†
The chicken must have died and went to heaven because it certainly was not in my sandwich. Lucky Chicken!¬†
Will not order from here again.",1,"2018-06-19 13:16:12",4,44,1
"52286390","The branding & show off which you possess doesnot fit in with the actual food and beverage which you delivered today. The delivery arrived late by more than 10 minutes. I have ordered two cold coffee, hazzle nut and cuban. There were no names mentioned in the cold coffee bottles. The bottle size was worth for 50-60 rupees. The sandwiches which were ordered were completely stale and quantity of egg and chicken was relatively very very low in the chicken egg sandwich. The other sandwich though stale had stable quantity of stuff in it. Overall, one of the sick & worst experiences having ordered and ate from your chefs! How can you charge 105 & 135 bucks for those tiny cold coffee bottles which were not even differentiated by their names! You feel money grows on trees and you can loot prople just by the company being named as Bombay Sandwich Company. If you really boast of your sandwich and beverage quality, extensify your services. 
Not at all a good experience ! ",1,"2018-06-13 23:16:59",1,2,0
