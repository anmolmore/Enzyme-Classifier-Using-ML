I had Cheese Maggi and it was smoky. We saw the guys do it live, putting the stove on a full flame and tossing around the vegetables. That was an experience. It's just that it was too spicy for me but I had it anyway, because who would say no to Maggi? ",4,"2018-11-19 12:35:50",122,636,0

"2162468","AM-PM! as the name goes, really the hunger savior for people in and around Gachibowli specifically for all those employees inside DLF.:) This is located right opp to DLF IT park! Although there are umpteen food joint, this for me is a standout because of the scrumptious maggi they make! They do have multiple variations out of maggi but my favorite is dry version of maggi like street noodles. My staple order is chicken dry maggi. Oh boi, it is so delicious and satiating to tastebuds. 
Waiting time us usually high in the late evenings. Take a friend alongside for quick chat and this noodles will add up to it :) 
My other favs are double egg maggie and omelette! ",4,"2018-10-13 12:51:49",96,1175,2

Both non-veg and veg dishes are available in both wet and dry type. My favourite is chicken fried Maggie. Drool worthy. I cannot stop obsessing over this place. Just fabulous. It‚Äôs a small bandi sort in the Cyber hub of the city which is DLF cyber city. I can travel all the way to just have their Maggie. I highly recommend this place to all those Maggie lovers out there.

Shawarma review.
While every review about this outlet here will be about the maggi, I would like to draw attention to the famous shawarma this outlet server a little far away in the same area.
Head out a little further towards kritunga, and you will see a couple of shawarma joints. And stands there with huge amount of Chicken is AM PM shawarma point.
There would be one word to describe it. Exemplary. Its simply delicious. Nothing else need be said. The taste is legendary and I love it to core.
All those unsatisfied with maggi, head on for shawarma.
The guy preparing the shawarma is fast and a true master at his skill.",4,"2018-06-22 21:26:18",207,1048,0
"36603278","The place used to be really nice but now the quality isn't that great. Their maggi is mostly very spicy or soggy. They just put in the same masala in every variety.

This is the adda for my gang when hunger strikes post a party since this is open almost throughout the night. The ‚ÄòCheese Fried Maggi‚Äô here is to die for. The normal Maggi here is bad but all the options under the fried Maggi section are really really yum! I wonder why the place is rated so low.

"464081","Hello,¬†
This is one of the most over-hyped, below-average, roadside stall I have ever visited! It is situated bang opposite to the DLF building in Gachibowli. It serves a variety of Maggie. There's no ambiance and definitely no hygiene. There's nothing much to explore/experience also. But if you really feel like having Maggie then you can visit one of the AM-PM Maggie outlet to try out egg/chicken/paneer/fried or regular Maggie.¬†
Thank you!",2,"2018-05-03 17:12:13",132,286,0

During the recent trip to Hyderabad, my work colleagues took me out to the DLF area in Gachibowli again to relive the years we have spent eating out post our work hours. This time they decided to take me to the AM - PM Maggi Point. ¬†¬† 
Like most other places in DLF, these joints are open until the wee hours in the morning, usually up to 2:30am - 3:00am. Even at these hours, you will find scores of folks waiting in line to have their tummy's filled. ¬†¬†What did we have? Maggi with Egg, Fried Egg Maggi, Maggi with Cheese, Double Egg Fried Maggi. In terms of taste, it just about passes the muster. Double Egg Fried Maggi was the better of the lot for me. There is nothing extra ordinary besides the fact that you can get warm food in these odd hours. For that, they deserve credit. ¬†¬† 
Service: They do a good job in managing the rush at the counters and no messing up the orders I'm told. ¬†¬† 
Price: Its value for the dime considering you are getting food at odd hours. ¬†¬† 
Ambience: Don't talk about it!! ¬†¬† 
I'd probably want to see some other places in the area the next time around and perhaps give this place a skip. ¬†¬†

Thinking that we can have maggie at home? 
Then you guys are missing some tasty thing. 
Don't go for regular maggie what you prepare at home. Try fried maggie which would make your mouth water. Fried egg maggie is the most loved item for most of the people. Fried Chicken, paneer maggie are also good. But if u don't like to eat maggie dry then make your own choice. ",4,"2018-02-17 14:06:53",85,917,0

"1440485","If you‚Äôve stayed in Hyderabad for sometime, you‚Äôll know about all the food stalls near DLF. This is one of the very known and visible place for Maggie snacks near DLF.
They have majorly two variants of maggie.
Fried - a little dry and fried on a pan
Normal - the authentic wet and juicy maggie
On these two variants they serve different kinds like veg, egg, cheese and chicken.
My personal favourite is ‚ÄòEgg Fried Maggie‚Äô.
They also serve omelet, bread omelet and egg burji. I have never really tasted these though. But I‚Äôm sure they taste good too.
Not considering the hygiene around (after all that‚Äôs a road side food stall),not is a good and a regular place to grab maggie snacks in the middle of a night.
Visit this place sometime, especially night time between 11 and 1 and try these maggie varieties. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre going to enjoy at least one of the available items here.",4,"2017-11-05 09:07:19",66,638,2

When it comes to the quality of the food it doesn't disappoint you but when it comes to food, the faster you make, the faster it looses its essence and taste.",2,"2017-10-15 10:16:39",24,76,0

I understand that the condition in which cooking is done and where we eat is very hygienic, as it is next to DLF Gate 2 road and also there are lot of flies flying around, but when it comes to taste of the Maggi, this store has lot of options to keep me happy atleast. Me and my wife have tried their fried egg maggi multiple times and it is indeed awesome, although its on the spicier side.
Kudos to the guy who makes Maggi here :-)",4,"2017-08-17 14:25:19",34,106,0

Attracted by the large crowd around this small joint located in DLF, we couldn't resist the curiosity about the Maggie being sold. The menu signboard gives you multiple variants of Maggie - plain or fried with veggies or egg or chicken and what not.
The fried Maggie gave me a unique mental picture and I ordered cheese fried Maggie. After a considerable wait and multiple reminders, I finally got my small bowl of Maggie. So fried cheese Maggie is nothing but Maggie fried with veggies with negligible amount of grated cheese on top of it.
The worse was the quantity served is equivalent to the Rs. 5 Maggie (with some cheese and veggie) costing me Rs. 50 and it was totally not worth it. I could have made a better one !!! ",2,"2017-03-14 18:20:34",155,1798,2

Yeah,  this place is heaven for everyone during rainy days and on those nights when you don't feel like cooking or have nothing eat at home. There are approximately 12 varieties of maggi available here,  though my favorites being the veg Maggie and the soupy masala maggie. Nothing special in taste.

"5804381","Who doesn't love Maggie especially in a rainy season! And when you realise that there is a dedicated Maggie place, you think that someone finally figured it out. You have high hopes from the different types of Maggi options available, but unfortunately you are disappointed.
We used Swiggy to order a delivery from the place. The order came in reasonable time but they did not give receipt citing that it's a small joint. When you are giving more than 3 orders it is common sense to write on the packet what than individual order is especially when vegetarian and non vegetarian food is involved unpacking is definitely not user friendly. But they left us playing a guessing game. The plastic forks and cups are the cheapest options you can ever find, very flimsy. 
The food quantity is very less and not value for money. It looks like noodles  but not sure if it's Maggi noodles. They use their custom masala which by the way is very very spicy. So if you're expecting the a version of typical Maggi Masala taste then you will be disappointed as I was. The noodles were very dry and spicy. 
Worth a try once but no repeat value for me. ",2,"2016-06-15 22:41:15",175,2393,5

"15750940","Fancy a midnight snack - this joint is open till 1 am- the menu is simple Maggie and egg bhurjee -  went for a taste of street food and found it by accident- the egg bhurjee + roti was awesome, reminded me of my college days.  In fact sampled lot of the street food around but will go back here for the egg bhurjee ",4.5,"2015-10-06 21:13:23",65,111,0
