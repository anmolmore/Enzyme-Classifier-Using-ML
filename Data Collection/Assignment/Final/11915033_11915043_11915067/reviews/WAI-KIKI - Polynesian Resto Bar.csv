"53776957","Food is good, but service is too slow. Chairs have food stains which is not expected at a 5 star restaurant, probably this is due to they maintained a light colored cover of chairs.",4,"2019-03-11 21:55:52",11,10,1
"37166770","Great ambience. Service is little slow as very few staffs are there. But staffs are very professional and well mannered. Food quality is great. Different types of food items are there. ",4,"2019-03-07 21:32:15",84,166,6
"37381843","When we visited Radisson Gachibowli we tried the food from Wai-Kiki. They have a typical hawaian/polinesian menu which is quite unique in Hyderabad.
The ambiance is good, peaceful and serene. Definitely one can relax and enjoy a good meal.
Food is delicious! We had Mushroom Aloha with Fish Stew hawain style, Tahiti vegetables with Huli Huli Pineapple Chicken and also Grilled Chicken. All the items were delicious! Not even one to be blamed.
For anyone interested in having a different type of food (something else than biryani and curry) this is the place.
Recommended !",4,"2019-02-28 11:26:31",173,332,4
"61718852","Have been meaning to write a review for this place for a long long time now. We absolutely loved the service here! While the food is delectable, what really caught my attention was the customer delight that the staff especially Srinu aims for. Our first visit, he was kind enough to make some great suggestions on terms of what we should order as well as what would be the perfect quantity.
The second visit was for the Radisson brunch where we reached slightly early but Srinu remembered us from our last visit and while we were waiting got us some coffee and cookies. The brunch began and the chef (I'm so sorry for forgetting your name) had a great experience planned for me. Since I loved cooking, the chef made me cook the dish we were going to eat. The experience was something I would never ever forget and once again a shoutout to Srinu as well as the chef!
Great great place for sea food lovers! I would definitely recommend that you visit! Do try the cocktails while you are there :)",5,"2019-02-24 17:35:14",14,5,0
"51941267","Wai Kiki(at the radisson blu, Gachibowli) is one of my new favorite places in Hyderabad. With being the only restaurant serving a Polynesian and Hawaiian cuisine, they’ll have you wanting more. Every dish we tried was delicious and filled with various flavours. The ambience is of the place is one of an all day diner, except a lot more stylish. Unknowingly, we ordered only Polynesian so you know I’m going back. All in all, wai Kiki was a wild new experience with exotic flavours and lots of nui na aloha . 
Everything we ate was excellent. The katsu was my absolute favorite and the Chocolate Island (dessert) is a must try.
Special thanks to Ritushree for her excellent service and for being so hospitable.",5,"2019-02-17 12:33:35",7,4,5
"33309288","This place is one of a kind! No literally. It’s the only restaurant in the city serving Polynesian and Hawaiian cuisine. I normally love Italian and Indian cuisine but it was becoming a bit repetitive. We were afraid trying out a whole new cuisine but we were so wrong. Wai - Kiki was a very pleasant change. The Executive chef - Mr. Manoj asked our taste preferences and suggested various dishes and soon our skepticism changed into sheer delight. Every single dish was just bang on delicious. Besides the great taste, Chef Manoj also put in amazing effort in the presentation of the dishes and they looked fantastic. The must try dishes are: Polynesian Drummies, Crispy Prawns, Korean BBQ chicken, and the Wai Kiki fried rice. Coming to the desserts, you MUST try the Chocolate Island. It is one of the best desserts I’ve ever had anywhere. Everything about this place is amazing. The ambience too is very modern and elegant. The glass waterfall is beautiful. You have to visit to see for yourselves. A special thanks to Chef Manoj and the servers for the flabbergasting food, hospitality and service! Keep up the amazing work!",5,"2019-02-16 04:32:07",18,38,10

"35694979","The one thing that strikes you about this place is the soothing ambience. And when you settle down, the food just hits you bang.
The Polynesian cuisine is nowhere near the Indian taste but thanks to chef Manoj's nack for being innovative, I got to taste some of the best dishes.
We started with the jalapeno cheese balls which had a mix of two cheese and where really yum. the pick of the appetizers was the mushroom Aloha which was very peculiar and very garlicky.
Veg kothe would be unlike any dimsums you would have encountered. It was a lil spicy but I thoroughly enjoyed the sauces.
I really really liked the spicy cocktail, though it's really not recommended for people who can't stand chilli.
For the main course we had the Hawaiian fried rice and the coconut rice which was rather sweet.
The rice was paired with Tahiti with a red gravy and the kelelo which was coconut based and again on the sweeter side.
One must try the rice with the Tahiti coz the combo brings the best of the taste, very different than the usual indian flavour but really nice.
Thanx for such a great hospitality team WAI KIKI. ",5,"2018-12-28 17:28:21",113,1194,4

"3146270","It's a great place to hangout and you will find delicious and wide variety of chicken, pork, fish & prawn. Staff were so polite and friendly. I visited this place along with my CEO, boss and of course with few other team members. I tried Indonesian chicken satay & Korean bbq chicken and I liked chicken satay the most. I recommend this place if you want to try some Polynesian.",4,"2018-12-13 22:32:09",6,47,0
"1464970","We walked into Waikiki not knowing the place and their Chef Manoj welcomed us and introduced himself which was the reason we chose to have dinner there. Waikiki is a new place and they have interesting Polynesian fare along with Thai and even Indian food from their other restaurant. We tried the Dimsum, Kothe and the soup which was coconut based and very soft on the palate.
The Tahiti rice was a nice but not a dissimilar taste to some of our own rice Pilavs.....
Ritushree was cheeky who served us and all in all a nice evening. Certainly highly recommended. We did not know till Manoj said they won the Times Food award.....",5,"2018-11-30 23:11:31",2,48,0

"27048493","One of my friend referred this restaurant. Though I was cynical about the variety of food, ms.priyanka had helped to choose as per my preference.

"31704207","First thing, it's just a hyped up place. I don't know what's amazing in this place according to many people other than the hefty menu prices. The hospitality is in top notch and that's the basic thing you can expect in any star hotel. Other than that, i didn't feel anything worthy. You could go to some other place and spending same money but can have a lot items compared to here.",2,"2018-11-18 09:25:07",10,17,0

"76573398","My first visit to Radisson Hyderabad, for an official trip with my colleague from Germany. For first day dinner we choose Wai Kiki, we were very impressed with the ambience and we were welcomed by very friendly Restaurant Manager.
First impression or experience with Polynesian food was really great, prepared by Chef Manoj. 
Throughout the stay around 14 days, Wai Kiki was our main hub for relaxing and had variety of delicious food with cocktails.

We had Polynesian Chicken Drumsticks for starters, Korean Barbeque Chicken for main course. We tried out their coconut rice which was wonderfully different. The chicken was lip-smackingly good and the accompanying dips were just right. We had the Chef's special Chocolate Island for dessert; it is so good you will want to have more!
A special thanks to the restaurant manager, Ms.Priyanka, and her smart, courteous team for making our meal more memorable with their prompt and smiling service.

"32509115","We have been meaning to come here for quite some time, and ended up here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.
We were pretty impressed with the ambience. It was very quaint, and we were welcomed and greeted by a very friendly hostess. 
The menu looked very exotic, and we were excited to try the dishes, which are said to be Polynesian, with a bit of French influence.
We went for their Flambed Prawn San Francisco and Waikiki Hawaian Pork Chops.
We also ordered the cocktail Mahia, to go with the main course.
The Chef was very very generous and gave us a complimentary portion of golden fried prawns, with a beautiful, fiery sauce.
The chef prepared the Flambed prawns in a live counter in front of us. They use white wine and vodka for the preparation of this dish.
It was very engaging, and I love it, when restaurants make a whole experience out of dining out.
Loved the prawns. The pork chops were a little tough, but the in house barbecue sauce was brilliant.
Presentation was top notch.
The chef and the staff kept taking feedback, and did their very best.
All in all a very good experience.",5,"2018-09-20 18:25:23",117,980,3

The curry was delicious and not at all spicy, which was fine by us. The cocktails were served in quirky tumblers and were good.

"41928997","I still remember the day of my childhood i dreamt of dining at star hotel. After many long years, that dream really came true in the last week. I was so excited to try their food. Dining at a star hotel really gives you a priceless and an incredible experience,isnt it??.
.
The place that i have visited is a part of the Radisson hotel which is located at hi-tech city. This place has got 4 restaurants in one building and luxury suites as well.
.
I was invited for inauguration of the restaurant named ""Wai -kiki"" which serves Polynesian cuisine. Seems new,right??. Yes,this is the only place in hyderabad which serves this cuisine. Basically,polynesian cuisine is from the Polynesian islands & hawaain islands. This cuisine got originated from hawaai. This cuisine is not so popular around the world,but it has got lot of specialities in it.
.
While you enter the place,you can feel those positive vibes and you will be able to hear tropical instrumentals.This place is luxurious with its comfortable seating and with the carving on the walls. They also have a bar which serves legit cocktails & the bartender is super skilled . I am a non-alcoholic guy,and i didn't try any of them.
.
So,the moment i picked the menu ... I wasn't able to order anything , because i am very new to this cuisine and i needed some help to order which item would be good. The chef himself came to us and described about the polynesian cuisine and suggested few items which shouldn't be missed at all. So,we started with the creole fish soup. This soup is totally different in its process, because the whole fish is combined with the soup while preparing it. So,we will be able to get the aroma of the fish easily. Tom kha soup was soo good and the chicken pieces were given enough and its also spicy enough.
.
From the starters, i have tried only one item because in total there were two starters given by them ,but i am allergic to mushroom and didn't dare to try it. But, my friends totally liked it more than anything here. I have tried crispy sweet and sour broccoli and water chestnuts. That was less in spice but tasted good.
.
The maincourse is really a fantastic experience ,because every item in the menu which was under main course will be cooked right infront of you on a small trolley. And ,the speciality is every item will be cooked under 5 minutes. I am guy who loves to see the dish cooking,arent you? I have tried paper thin lamb flambe which is served with mashed potatoes and some veggies. Lamb was tossed with butter,later on rum & white wine were added into it which gave an amazing aroma . Lamb wasn't juicy,as i said it was paper thin lamb. After that, flambed prawn San Fransisco was made. Prawns werent cooked totally. That can be known by,if prawns didn't turn straight in shape ,it can be easily said that it wasnt cooked totally. It was yummy and creamy. It was melting in mouth like anything. Korean style barbeque is one thing which needs to be served in every restaurant and it has to be know by everyone in this city. That was unlike the barbeque which we are having in this city. Ther process,the marination,the plating ... everything is different when it comes to korean style barbeque. This was so juicy and so soft from the inside. I have always tried thai reen curry . It was a regular thing in Japanese restaurants. But, Here i have tried Thai chicken red curry which tasted totally different from the green ones which we get in other restaurants. It was spicer than that,it was more creamy and it has got less coconut flavor in it. This did go really good with the Hawaiian style fried rice. I didnt find anything special in it ,but it tasted fantastic.
.
In the desserts,few items are made in the trolley right infront of us just like the maincourse. Desserts got delayed, but after tasting it i felt like it was totally worthful taking much time in preparing it. Started with chefs special Chocolate island. There is a strawberry flavoured icecream inside the Chocolate ball and hot toffee sauce was poured on it to melt that outer layer. It was a jaw-dropping experience. That tasted sweet and it is super cool inside. Flamed crepes ballon rogue was made on the trolley . First of all, a scoop of vanilla icecream was moulded in the crepe and few strawberries are caramelised and the red wine was added to it to balance the flavors . The presentation was a feast to my eyes. Not just the presentation,it also tasted ace
.
Overall,it was a nice and priceless experience to dine -in here. The staff were so kind and courteous. They have helped a lot in suggesting the dishes. It was nice meeting everyone over there. And ,the chef was so brilliant and he is aware of everything in Polynesian cuisine.

Thanks,radisson

The spices used in this cuisine are opted from other cuisines, and even some ingredients too.
In soup, we had creole fish soup and the Tom kha gai. In the fish soup, you'll get the flavours of Indian curry and here the whole fish will be placed in soup while making it.
The Tom kha gai, the creamy chicken soup was so delicious and the coconut milk acts as the main ingredient here.
In food, we tried the Korean BBQ chicken, mushroom Aloha, flambed prawn San Francisco, paper thin lamb flambe, Thai red curry, Hawaiian style fried rice, lamb teriyaki Kong style.
My favourite were the Korean BBQ chicken, mushroom Aloha, ""paper thin lamb flambe"" this dish was made on live cart before us within 5mins, and the Thai red curry
In desserts we tried the chef's SPL chocolate island, chocolate strawberry retreat and the flamed crepes Ballon rouge. I love the flamed crepes Ballon rouge and the chef's special chocolate island 💕
Overall, it was an amazing experience here.
