"1874218","I've ordered veg sandwich and also French fries with all the toppings available.
Veg sandwich - It tasted very good with all the toppings, my hunger was satisfied with it. It was exactly how a sandwich should be but they've added very little quantity of toppings especially the CORN, I can only see 5-8 kernels of sweet corn. It felt like it's better not to pay for the toppings next time. However, apart from that everything regarding the sandwich was good.
French fries - It was the WORST FRENCH FRIES I'VE EVER HAD. It looked like they were dated back 100 years old. It wasn't fresh at all. Neither crispy nor tasty. They were very cold. I wish they would make it much tastier. Will see later if they improve it.
Overall rating - 4/5 (would have given 5/5 but giving 4 because of French fries )
Taste - 4.5
Packing - 5/5
Quality (sandwich) - 5/5
Quality (French fries) - 1/5
Quantity - 4/5 for Sandwich.",4,"2019-05-01 02:34:22",10,13,4

"2582902","Fries were rock hard like bread sticks. Not sure how they managed to do this. Veg corn sandwich tasted more like tomato sandwich than corn. Avoid this for anything tasty. I am not going near it again. ",1,"2019-03-05 07:34:38",3,0,0

"51385400","(Ferrero Rocher thick shake)The decorating part was good but then the taste ain't satisfactory. I felt like I was sipping a regular plain chocolate ice- cream. As I went consuming it just got stronger in taste which still ain't good. Felt mild taste of Ferrero Rocher at one or two places. I just didn't feel it was a proper thickshake.",2,"2019-02-12 17:12:58",60,16,0

"51385400","Extremely disappointed with Nutella fries. The amount of Nutella is far from enough. It's as though Nutella is sprinkled for name sake. I don't know which nearby restaurant delivers. I've previously ordered Nutella fries from different location from same Frying Pan and the fries were dipped in Nutella. I'd like to receive my order properly again. Though the caramel fries tasted nice it was obvious that the caramel was ready made or supermarket bought. This is a very disappointing experience.",1,"2019-01-29 15:34:12",60,16,3

"51385400","Super tasty Nutella fries. Very simple dish yet very tasty. Major concern here is that **fries were kinda dried-off hard**. Have ordered previously also but the amount of Nutella I got this time was much more. I hope they maintain this from now on. I don't know if it's zomato or the restaurant but things ordered from zomato take really long time. I mean Nutella fries is just two components and it took almost an hour. I hope this is taken into consideration.",3,"2019-01-23 16:41:21",60,16,1
"51385400","Nutella fries were very tasty. Only let down was that the quantity of fries can be more.",4,"2018-12-26 19:03:06",60,16,0
"51385400","I'd actually review 3.5
Ordered:
1. Cheese corn chilli sandwich : not so great but ok in taste. Was actually expecting cheese. And also I couldn't find corn inside the sandwich. Quantity was the regular two slices of bread cut diagonally.
2. Nutella fries : regular mcd fries with Nutella drizzled on top. These fries were good. The amount of fries was also decent.
3. Masala fries: were crispy and good.
4. Nutella sandwich : wasn't expecting it to be a good combo(ain't no Nutella fan) but turned out very well. The taste of salty butter fried bread and Nutella was good.
For all the items I received, packaging was done really well.",3,"2018-12-19 19:16:20",60,16,2
"67668422","Satisfied with the taste. Looking for more options. Budget friendly. Fast delivery. Small place. Will be visiting again soon for fries and wiches.",5,"2018-12-06 12:46:44",1,0,0
"33167664","Paneer Chilli Sandwich = 3/5
Nutella sandwich = 4/5
Cheese Corn Chilli Sandwich =3/5
I ordered from this place. the packing was fine. The sandwiches were tasty no doubt about it. but when i order a corn/paneer sandwich i expect to see that in my sandwich. in both of them, there were hardly 10 pieces of corn/finely diced paneer pieces. that's why the low rating.",3,"2018-12-03 16:40:35",15,51,0
