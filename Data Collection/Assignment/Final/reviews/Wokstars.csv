So, a friend of mine recommended me saying this was the best wok in town. I tried their noodles with their Chinese holy basil sauce and chicken and it was one the best I've ever had. This is going to be my go to place in the future. Hope the food stays consistent. I'd recommend anyone to try this .",5,"2019-04-07 10:53:45",1,8,0

First and foremost unique is awesome. Chinese/Asian cuisines we all know are dime a dozen but what’s not too common are places like Wokstars. 
Ordered Udon Noodles with chilly rush sauce, egg, chicken, all exotic veggies and the hint of magic powder.  
I had also tried the jasmine sticky rice with shrimps with 
Packaging was one of the best. ",5,"2019-03-30 03:35:57",25,130,1

Experience could have been much better its a shame really ",3,"2019-03-24 23:21:08",4,66,0
