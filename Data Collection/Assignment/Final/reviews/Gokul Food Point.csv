"52710173","When I started eating food from this restaurant the first thing came in my mind is cheap and best. The quality of the food is good compared to it's price. Non Vegans should try their Butter Chicken and phulka. I suggest you to try their gobi paratha. It is a place where bachelor's can have their lunch or dinner. They have good quality biriyani.",4,"2019-02-12 11:52:17",3,2,0

"43420228","This food joint is a kind of North Indian food mess. We can get pulka here for 6Rs each. Bachelor's place, and decent prices as seen in menu including non veg. We tried pulka with dal tadka and Gobi Manchurian. Both were good comparitively with their prices. Best thing is we can get food around 11:30PM here in Gachibowli.",3,"2018-10-17 03:32:51",46,23,0

Had gulab jamun, chicken chowmein, chili chicken and paneer masala recently. 
Except the chill chicken and gulab jamun, the rest items were okayish. The chili chicken was good but the curry leaves in it was a total mess. 
The gulab jamun was amazing.
