"41280464","Looking for Bihari food you are at right place. Their staff and all food will remind of Bihar. I like Parantha and thali here, not much spices just like home food. If you are visiting this place making a mind set of high ambience and lavish place, sorry dear you are in wrong place. Looking for home food then you are at right place. If you start comparing this restaurant with star categories restaurant them you are...... ",5,"2018-10-26 09:52:21",18,3262,0

"895038","A small and unnoticeable joint serving Bihari food. Parathas are also ok. Bachelors can get roti from here at just Rs. 5 each roti. Also when the cook skips or people who want to have daily food can opt for this place. ",3.5,"2016-11-04 11:44:04",400,2709,0
"34846227","If you want home food with less oil and pocket friendly you can try this out. I have been here couple of times and I have tried all parathas but liked aloo and Gobi. Satu paratha and onion paratha weren‚Äôt that great. They serve parathas with raita and curry but one paratha isn't that filling.
Ambiance is not good so I had always taken parcel.",3,"2016-06-21 00:26:48",153,1206,0
"33278380","Awesome place for having a light but home type food. Waiters are courteous and will serve you with good attitude.

"257213","It is a humble place to get home like North Indian food,¬†
the parathas are sumptuous and the thali which has unlimited rotis , rice, daal and 2x Sabji is pretty well made, the food is non-spicy and light, in general.
The service is quick, and they treat you with respect.
Recommendation: Aloo Parathas (Have to try the Sattu Parathas seeing that many people have took a liking to it)

"2634040","What could be tastier than a modest ""Ghar ka khana""!! If you are a bachelors like me or and married couple who are not much into cooking, then dear friends, this place is a life savior. 
They serve mainly north Indian simple thalis and they taste so homely. Nothing much fancy about this place, the setup is similar to bhojanalay or mess. But when it comes to taste it‚Äôs simply the best. Especially¬†¬†¬† for bachelors like me who don‚Äôt like their hostel food and who got bored with masala or fast food this place is a boon.

"1944468","This place is really shady, having said that; it's also really good. Homely food. The food does not make you feet heavy and stuffed. Extremely economic, each paratha is 30/-. The Sattu ka Paratha is YUMMY! They make Litti chokha only on order for large no. of people. The folks there are amazing, they treat you like family.¬†

"86715","If you are in for veg homely food, ID you are in for a Bihari treat, go for this one.
The place is the oldest restaurant in Indiranagar as Brajesh ji , the owner told me so. He is sensitive about people wanting to have quality food at reasonable rates and that what you will get here.
RS. 60 for a satisfying meal is a deal. 
The food is piping hot and serves on time. The service is prompt and courteous. Prahlad, one of the staff goes out of the way to make you feel at home.
If not for a meal, one can try the aloo, sattu or gobhi parathas. They also have Litti Chokha on weekends.
So roll up your sleeves and dig in :)",4.5,"2016-03-16 14:05:47",110,1535,5
"1893312","50 Rs. for 2 aloo parathas and that too in Gachibowli what can be a better deal than this if u are a paratha lover? Saw reviews in zomato and went to the place. The ambience was good. The service was also good, dealt with customers well and coming to the taste, it was also good but not the best. But definitely VFM.

"32090997","It is a very good place to have unlimited thali at very chep price...!!!
The cleanliness is ok. But the food quality is good. 
It is a good place if you are fed up of your mess food. It's has more worth than value.
Definitely go for it....!!! 
I would recommend it as best place to save your money with some good quality food.",4,"2015-10-05 11:06:18",23,44,0
"15579568","Simple food and pocket friendly, not very tasty. Rotis are not cooked properly. Paranthas are just good. Not worth revisiting. Service is good though.",3,"2015-09-05 08:51:58",29,29,0
"398915","The place deserves a 5/5 not because of the food but for the service. If you are missing mom, yes mom, then go to this place. The reason for this statement is the owner of this place who will serve you in a sweet bihari accent "" Aur Khaaeeeaa Naa!!!"" and you will feel as if you are being served food at home.
Food: Unlimited veg thali @ 60 bucks which includes roti, rice, dal, sabzi and occasional sweet dish. Simple yet good.
PS: Female foodies might feel little awkward, in case you are alone, as this place is pretty male dominated :P",4.5,"2015-08-15 15:05:28",155,1798,1

"1987960","I eat here almost everyday. It is more of ""Ghar ka khana"" - Non spicy, less in oil content and served with love. The stuffed parathas are amazing. The thali is cheap @Rs60 for Unlimted food that includes two dry vegetables, beans and dal.
They have a small Chinese counter outside that serves Vegetarian Chinese (Panner noodles, Veg manchurian, etc.).
It is not so clean, but then, how much can you expect at such low rates ?
A rating of 3.5 is quite good for a Dhaba.",3.5,"2014-08-08 00:14:38",50,72,0
