I ordered pav bhaji and manchow bhel puri, but didn‚Äôt savour either one. Pav bhaji fondue concept is good, but made it super loaded with spices. Bhel puri lacked on multiple things. Haven‚Äôt tried other items so can‚Äôt comment hows the place overall. ",3,"2019-05-18 20:14:06",7,1,0

"69938280","Our first time at Gappe Vappe, chaat fusion is such a novel concept that we'd been waiting for this location to open. We never got around to visiting the Kukatpally location.
Here are the dishes we ordered, shared among the five of us.
Dahi Puri (8 puris) 150 Rs - Simple and classic. Just pops in your mouth. The presentation is unique. One of the favorites from this visit.
Overpriced but recommended.
Dahi Samosa 120 Rs - Portion is generous. Bang for the buck dish.
Pani Puri Bharnivala (12 puris) 90 Rs- This dish is a playful spin on the traditional, comes with different kinds of pani served in tiny adorable ceramic jars along with crispy puris and filling. A treat and recommended for the experience.
Aloo Tikki platter (4 tiny tikkis) 120 Rs - Extremely disappointing dish. The tiny Tikkis are dry with a strange lentil filling. Looks way better than it tastes. A miss for us.
Paneer kathi kebab with rumali roti 150 Rs - Everything tasted pre made, especially the dry crispy romali rotis and cold batter fried kebabs were the dampener. The soya paneer curry is well done. The dish itself comes together despite the shortcomings, the lack of freshness/softness of the rotis and kebabs. Unique dish.
Cottage cheese in masala
sauce wrap 150 Rs - Well liked among our group. Skimpy on the portion size of the wrap. The crispy bhindi/okra fries are great.
Overall an enjoyable experience. We'd go back to explore the menu....",4,"2019-04-14 15:24:17",6,2,6
