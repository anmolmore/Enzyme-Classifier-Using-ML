"32534966","This Place has only take aways, so I have ordered Red velvet Creme Cheese cake, and the Cake taste is lip smacking and everyone liked it. We even took a box of fresh brownies which are awfully tasty.
Only lacking thing is this place doesn't support customization of cakes. Prices are a bit high but they are worth it as the taste is good.",5,"2019-05-17 15:28:00",19,20,5
"110142804","It is one of the premium bakers in Gachibowli. Most of the items are made on order, probably 24 hours prior booking is required. I ordered a Triple chocolate cake for my husband. It was good in taste but nothing extraordinary and came with nice packing.

Good - Top cream layer, Good number of hazelnuts.
Bad - Extremely dry, hardly any cream inside the layers.

I‚Äôve been a regular with their brownies, they‚Äôre super light and yet so tasty! The only negative is that they come in a box of around 15 pieces as the smallest offering.

"331264","When we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it.
My sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds Labonel Fine Baking in high regard. Keeping this in minds we thought a Labonel cake will make her birthday more special.
We ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day. We also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake. Both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd Sept. till 6pm (this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm).
They decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4:50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5:30pm. So, not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment's notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store.
Well since the cake held sentimental value for me I did leave immediately and rushed to the Gachibowli store. I made it there by 5:10pm and can you imagine my dismay when I saw that the store was closed! To add to it no one answered the phone.
I stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response.
I could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional. If they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments I do not think it would ever matter how their product is.
My sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products.
Since they did not contact me back even the next day I feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post. I hope this falls on deaf ears of Labonel owners.
I know I will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this, you have been warned :)

Cupcakes that edge sweet without being overpowering so I can share with the ""I don't like desserts that are actually sweet"" crowd. Don't be surprised if you gulp down the entire box in a sitting.
A fine carrot cake cupcake that almost makes you feel like you're eating ""healthy"" until you eat the luscious cream cheese frosting. That's one of my top favorites.

"31713248","Although, I have not been spoken rudely to by anyone working at this place, I can very well believe the negative experience many others have written about. Hochn√§sig is a word that came to my mind when I visited this place the first few times. Hoch is high and n√§sig comes from nose. This German word can be loosely translated to snobbish or haughty, but these words do not describe my impression of them as well as ‚Äúhochn√§sig‚Äù does. However, that is not all they are. They are in fact one of the best bakeries in Hyderabad and one can very well understand where their pride comes from. I said one of the best and not the best for three reasons:
1.¬†¬† ¬†This place is expensive.
2.¬†¬† ¬†Except for the cupcakes and brownies and occasionally the chocolate cake, everything must be ordered at least a day in advance.
3.¬†¬† ¬†They don‚Äôt sell cake-slices. You must buy the entire cake, which you must order in advance.
Now coming to the gooooooood stuff‚Ä¶
Brownies:
The best I have ever had! The chocolate is rich, deep and the brownie itself is light, moist and almost melts in your mouth. I know some of you may say that that‚Äôs not how a brownie is supposed to be, that it is supposed to be dense and gooey and you may be right. BUT, try this one for the flavor and its melt-in-your mouth quality.
Chocolate Cakes:
I have tried one of their Classic Chocolate cake and Triple Chocolate cake. All the chocolate cakes are made from the same batter as the brownies, so each one of them is rich, moist with an excellent, deep, chocolate flavor. The best one is clearly the Triple Chocolate cake.
Carrot Cake:
To me there are two kinds of carrot cakes. One is the desi kind that you get at Parsi bakeries, which is moist, dense, has khoya/mava and cardamom even. The other kind is the fancier, videsi version, which has nuts (mostly walnuts), cinnamon, a cream-cheese frosting and is drier. Labonel being a ‚Äúfine baking‚Äù place naturally has the latter kind. Although I am not much of a fan of this kind because of the cinnamon, which in my mind always over-powers any dessert, Labonel‚Äôs carrot cake is the best I have ever had in this category.
Cheesecakes:
I have only had one of their cheesecakes, blueberry I think. It was a right amount of fluff, fat, sweetness and flavor. The base was delicious too. However, the cheesecakes at Eclat or Chili‚Äôs are slightly firmer, hence a bit better.
Cupcakes:
Cupcakes are their only product that I am not a fan of. They are too small, the frosting is a little too soft and in my opinion add no value to cake. You can give the cupcakes a complete miss.
Cookies:
Choco-chip, Double chocolate and white chocolate/raspberry and the only 3 kinds they bake. Soft, rich, moist, chewy and yummmmmmm‚Ä¶
Miscellaneous:
There are some seasonal cakes like the honey cake or the plum cake. The honey cake is ok, but the plum cake is so loaded with rum that it can make a teetotaler a little tipsy.
Overall, if you don‚Äôt mind spending a lot and are a cake fan like me, then don‚Äôt give this place a miss.",4.5,"2017-11-03 17:12:44",20,60,10

Classic calm interior. I loved their theme color ""Blue"". Packaging is sober and royal, an excellent house warming present.¬†
Brownies were soft, chocolaty and yum yum yum. They were simply the best.¬†
One has to buy a complete box of 15 piece medium sized square brownie. Rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 4-5 days, per brownie it costs ~50. Good deal for a group of 6-7 people however not so good deal for single person/loner.¬†
Place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie.¬†

Thank you for spoiling my day. ",1,"2017-05-06 17:45:02",1,1,0

Their chocolate cake is very rich and gooey buy my first preference has always been red velvet !! 
Their brownies are my husbands fav.. 
Their packaging and all are high end so best for gifting !! 
But they don't customise the cake according to your taste.. you've got to take what they have !! 
Only downside is , Its a over priced , so occasional indulgence is what I go with in order to satisfy my sweeth tooth .. ",3.5,"2017-04-06 10:46:55",15,10,0

Been wanting to visit ever since I heard about the Banjara Hills branch, but somehow never got the chance to.
The price is a bit steep though, but an occasional indulgence which the product is meant for anyway, is perfectly fine.¬†
I'm not too good with dessert consistency and stuff, but all i can say is this is a place I would definitely recommend for dessert treats and parties.
The brownies are moderately sweet and rich and not too moist.

"37875700","I have been lusting after this place, after reading too many 5 star reviews on Zomato. ¬†So yesterday the occasion was right ¬†and I was in the mood to splurge and enjoy some quality stuff with my SO. Unfortunately, I was utterly disappointed with the service that they had to offer. The staff at Labonel don't know anything about customer service.They were very rude and mean to us. I wanted to check their catalog but the person was behaving as if I was there to steal their products. Very impatient and unwilling to help. And also their phone number never works. Tried calling several times and never got a response. Anyways coming to food. I only ordered assorted collection of cupcakes The price burnt a hole in my ¬†pocket. Only 15 tiny cupcakes for 850rs. The flavors are vanilla, chocolate and red velvet with vanilla and chocolate frosting. I tried the vanilla and chocolate so far and I ¬†can say that chocolate cup cake is just fine, nothing special or out of the world experience like some other reviews claim it to be. Vanilla cupcake was dry and tasteless. Yes it was like eating a sponge(I am not saying that the cupcakes was as soft as a sponge it was as tasteless as a sponge). Nothing but just hype . I have had better cupcakes for a lot less money in small bakeries. ¬†
Final note: Never ever ¬†going to visit the place again. Overrated place",2,"2017-02-15 23:48:53",6,6,0

"2841518","Definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason. Amazing cakes and brownies. It is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever. 
My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes. ",3.5,"2017-02-12 21:49:58",73,951,0

"29124570","Absolutely delighted with our overall experience. The shop had an excellent festive decoration. Ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time. We also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well. Want to try everything in the menu in future. Keep up the great work!! Will definitely recommend.",5,"2017-01-13 19:03:48",74,168,0

"37012183","I dont know much about gachibowli branch, but  banjara hills branch has the worst costumer service that I have ever seen in my life..! Very ill professional employees who cannot guide their costumers properly to their place. They have great quality in what they serve but zero in how they serve. My whole party got ruined because of their so called great service. I have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery, ofcourse there was none. I was okay with it and said I will collect it from their store. I almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my @ order and due to heavy traffic, I reached the place  exactly 5 min late from their closing time. I kept giving them information about how far I am and that I would reach them in less time. I requested them to wait for 5 minutes as I was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills. They answered my call at 9:00 when I was near GVKONE. I said I will come in 5 min they said they will wait. But, by the time I reach their place everything was locked. I called them 100 times and their was no response. What an awful service..! If you have a big party, please don't rely and order anything from this place. Worst experience..! ",1,"2016-12-06 06:25:25",1,2,0

"13524","Updated review:
Ever since my first visit to Labonel I have already been a sucker for their brownies and now am gonna be for their cup cakes too. This cup cake box has 3  varieties of mini cupcakes: chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. All the three varieties were baked to perfection with extremely soft, airy and moist sponge with this luscious and velvety icing on top. They are definitely at the top of their game right now.
P.S. the icing was a bit sweet for our personal taste.
Previous review:
A class apart, fine baking luxurious bakery in the midst of all the hustle bustle. Labonel holds a very different, sophisticated yet very pleasant aura. All this while I avoided this sweet gem coz I assumed it's hell expensive (considering cost for two stated as 3000) but that's certainly not the case.
Because I was in a hurry and dint have time to try, test and enquire about all the items, I quickly picked up a box of chocolate brownies. Heavenly, decadent, sinful, melt in the mouth, luxurious, delectable, delightful....I can go on and on raving about this piece of art. I do like to clear the air about misconception of Labonel being shockingly expensive coz it is not. A box of 15 brownies with utmost quality for 650 and 15 cupcakes that too with three different flavours for 800 is more than a fair deal, coz once in a while your sweet tooth needs extra pampering ;P

"2239252","I went to Labonel a long time ago. 
There has always been a lot of hype about Labonel, especially for their cupcakes. I personally disliked the red velvet cupcakes because of the buttercream frosting. Second, the cupcakes were available only in boxes and not individually which wasn't cost effective or practical at all. 
However, I tried their brownies at a later point through a friend's purchase. They are quite delicious. I would definitely have more. But wouldn't go through the effort of buying a whole box. ",3.5,"2016-10-13 01:04:57",7,1,0
