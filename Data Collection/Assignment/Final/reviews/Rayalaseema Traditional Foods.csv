"75008567","I have ordered RaagiSangati, Pacchimirapa Kodi Curry, Miriyala Kamjupitta fry
RaagiSangati was ok...I given 2 star rating atleast as this was ok
Miriyala Kamjupitta fry was not actually fry...they given me the gravy.... restaurant guys should work on right names of dishes they are preparing with...and taste of the dish was average...the bird was just dipped into some spicy curry...that's it....
Coming to my worst experience...Pachi Mirapa Kodi curry...the curry of so sour and not at all good...I got a doubt if the chicken was not fresh or the tomatoes used to prepare curry was spoiled??? I checked and found that some ingredients in the curry was spoiled is the reason for that sour taste...the curry was hot...as I am very choosy in food I found the curry was spoiled somehow... something is bad in it..
I tried calling the restaurant guys to know how they are actually prepare these curries during order preparation....nobody picked the call for several times....I reached out to Zomato support...by the time the food was already packed and delivery person picked the order.... worst experience ever",1,"2018-12-13 00:49:34",1,0,0

"37112009","Not sure if they even realise that they are running a restaurant. Highly unhygenic. Ordered egg biryani and then following happens:
1) Give fried eggs covered with rice from chicken biryani as I find chicken pieces and bone although very small but will hurt your teeth badly.
2) I ordered for dinner but the eggs seemed as if they were boiled and fried in morning, cold and not fresh taste.
3) Rice was cold as well, seems biryani was prepared in after noon and they never bothered to heat it again.
4) finally 1/4th food was eaten and then comes a DEAD FLY along with rice.
5) Had to throw away the food.",1,"2018-05-21 23:28:20",16,12,0
