"50113671","Noodles Inc is a fast-casual chain nestled in Gachibowli, amidst the corporate hub, opposite to DLF. As the name implies, it serves mostly Noodles and Rice. The ambiance is huge , simple and tidy, which can easily accommodate more than 50 people. I loved the wall of appreciation, where the customers write feedback on a sticky note and paste it on the wall. They have a live open kitchen, where they cook the food right in front of your eyes. How good it is to have an open kitchen, where you witness for yourself what goes into your grub.Among oodles of noodles on the menu, there are dishes with surprisingly interesting fusion. It will serve you your favorite noodles in a box so that you can easily carry it around and eat your noodles at your own pace. I was there with a bunch of foodies and almost tried all the dishes on the menu.
Alfredo Noodles: Creamy with subtle flavors. Mild flavors isn't my thing and found it disappointing.
Sicilian Noodles: With tiny titbits of fried and crispy garlic and chunks of chicken, every bite was filled with olive oil and garlic flavour. This is the best here.
Chicken 65 Noodles : Indo chinese combination, where the noodles tasted like gravy of chicken 65.
Pesto Noodles : This needs a lot of improvement.
South Indian Sambar Rice: This is the best here. Chinese cuisine intermingling with South Indian which is a divine experiment for all foodies.
Stroganoff Rice: Taste more like rice and milk with almost no taste.",5,"2019-05-15 08:49:50",76,180,21

Om nom nom!
Visited this place with a bunch of foodies. Tried quite alot of dishes. Special mention about the service, the staff is is super sweet and humble. Let's begin!
AMBIENCE:
The minimalistic decor stole my heart. Loved the colour coordination of the whole place. Special mention for the appreciation wall. The idea is so cool! 😁
The place can accommodate around 40 to 50 people all at once. They have an open kitchen which really resonated with me.
FOOD:
NOODLES-
• Alfredo: I love Alfredo! But when I had it here the flavour was not up to the mark. Chilli flakes and oregano brought the real taste Outta it. Tasted good.👌
•Arrabbiatta: The sauce is made of dried chilli flakes, tomato and garlic. This tasted decent.
•Sicilian: The star of the evening! Loved the tiny chunks of ginger in it.♥
•Khow Suey: This was creamy and flavourful. Tasted decent.
•Pesto: This was a huge letdown. Needs alot of improvement.
•Japanese Pan: Was giving me desi noodles flavours but nevertheless it tasted really good.👌
•Chicken 65: I'd request the management to make this dish spicier and more desi. If a customer orders this dish then surely they're a sucker of desi Chinese. Hope you take this suggestion ✌
•South Indian Stew - SAMBAR NOODLES! YESHHHH! SAMBAR NOODLES!🙌 Tasted divine 😻
•Abesto: Didn't find anything different but this tasted decent.
RICE-
•South Indian sambar rice: Just the way it had to be, Perfect!♥
•Stroganoff Veg: huge disappointment. Needs alot of improvement. The cheese can be thicker and they can blend in more spices.
Noodles here start at ₹80! Packaging is cute and handy! Loved this Idea of the whole place.
All in all, 4/5.",4,"2019-05-14 02:21:00",37,89,60

I never knew noodles could be served in all such varities ! I had been to Noodles Inc for a review session with my blogger friends ! An outlet that is spacious with a lot of seating and an open kitchen where you can see how the noodles are being made . The outlet is located near a lot of offices and I see that the business has a really good prospect and will only grow as they are maintaining the store really well ! It's a good place where you can grab some noodles instead of the same kind of food with family and friends ! The noodles are served in a fancy box . We got hands on some drool worthy dishes such as the Sicilian ,the South Indian Stew , Thai green curry , pesto ,Arabatia , know suey and the Japanese pan ! South Indian stew is ? Any guesses !? Yeah! It's noodles with sambar and I was astonished when I got to know that ! It didn't dissapoint me at all and the item that you have to surely try your hands on is the Sicilian . Sicilian is made out of just noodles with sauted garlic and Vegetables tossed using olive oil and trust me you'll just crave for more every time you eat it ! Pesto and Arbatia also didn't dissapoint us and these would also not need an introduction as these are well known ! The other set of items also did a good job with the quality and taste ! The pricing here is pocket friendly !
When it comes to the service I would say the friendliest staff and cheers to the owners who make you feel worth ! Noodles khau kush ho jao ! ",5,"2019-05-13 11:17:03",127,272,14

The name itself says it’s exclusively for Noodles. 
Until I visit this place I didn’t know noodles can has these many varieties. 
Visited this place for a tasting session. 
So we ordered many dishes. But I will tell what I liked the most. 
Veg Alfredo- First when they served it had very less salt and cream. Then we asked them for a change. It was crazy with all proper ingredients.
Veg Pasto - This has a flavour of Basil leaves. It was okayish. 
Khow Suey - This was so different and it had a flavour of Coconut Milk, little bit of curd and lemon. 
One of my fav here. 
Sicilia  - They added chopped and fried Garlic. This literally stole my heart. 
Sambhar Spaghetti- South Indian style Noodles it is. 
Sambhar with Rice is a great combination and yeah it is tasty with noddles too. 
Must try - Sicilia, Sambhar Spaghetti. 
Ambiance - It’s super cool with spacious seating and wall of appreciation. 
Service - They are so friendly. They were free to take suggestions and change the taste as you like.

"92998708","A noodles fan are you?? Then this is the place for you. Visited this place yesterday for lunch. Located right opposite DLF gate 3 this place has ample seating and has a nice cheerful ambience with minimalistic and subtle interiors. They have an open kitchen and all they serve is noodles. Now don't be disheartened by this as they serve a variety of flavours from across the globe in their menu. They have Japanese Pan, Russian Stroganoff, Burmeese Khow Suey, Alfredo, Arabbiatta, Goreng and also South Indian Stew. Now you see what I meant when I said their menu covers the globe!!
We were a large group and hence could taste almost the entire menu.
Alfredo was creamy and mild. You can go for it if subtle flavors are your thing. Arabbiatta was super tangy with the tomato flavour being a bit overpowering.
Khow Suey was amazing. It had the rich flavour of the coconut milk in it - chicken and vegetables cooked in the milk makes it delicious.
Sicilian is one of my favourites. It has fried garlic all over. The flavour it imparts to the dish is magical.
Japanese Pan was also great. Chicken 65 noodles is your go to option if desi chineese is your thing. Russian Stroganoff is super mild- more so than the Alfredo too.
I was a bit disappointed with the Pesto. South Indian Stew was the show stealer. It tastes somewhat like sambar rice and is rich in flavour with all the Indian masalas in it.
All these noodles are available in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian varieties. Their open kitchen is remarkably clean and well maintained. So no hygiene worries...And the best part is the price. Their menu starts at Rs80 and is quite reasonably priced.
So the next time you feel like having noodles head straight for the Noodles Inc. ",4,"2019-05-13 01:31:25",29,34,41
"43309790","A new outlet in Gachibowli serving varieties of noodles Is noddles inc.
It is a small place with a decent ambience accommodating up to 30 to 40 pax.
The staff here are friendly.
The place has open kitchen and a beautiful wall for reviews by the customers.
The customers are allowed to write about their experience at the place and stick it on the wall.
I really liked this concept.
I’ve been to this place with a group of foodie friends for lunch.
We have tried the Alfredo noodles.
They were creamy but a bit bland.
It tasted good after adding some chilli flakes.
Arrabbiata noodles had milder flavour but tasted great .
We also tried Sisilian noodles 
Khow suey noodles 
Veg pesto noodles
Japanese pan noodles
Abesto noodles
South Indian stew noodles
Stroganoff noodles
South Indian stew noodles 
All of them tasted good .
The South Indian stew noodles was the one which I personally liked .
This is like a South Indian dish (noodles with sambar)
A new concept of this place !
I personally like this place and request them to include mocktails in their menu soon!
Do visit!",4,"2019-05-12 21:52:27",58,595,25
"30521228","Food was horrible. We ordered Pesto noodles, I don’t know what was served. Couldn’t it that more than 2 spoons as the taste was pathetic. 
Alfredo was again noodles dipped in burnt milk. No cheese at all...
Waste of money until they improve their food taste and quality completely. 
Ambience: 6/10
Location : 8/10

"61019715","Very reasonable and filling for the price. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Have personally taken take away of almost dishes except south indian stew and mie goreng. The only bad experience I've had so far was with the north indian stew but I suspect that was because I ate it quite late after prep.",4,"2019-05-08 19:41:16",1,0,0

"656158","I ordered a chicken stroganoff noodles from this outlet, it's a new place which serving new customized noodles.
The packaging and delivery was of very poor standard, they pack the food in thin paper bag, which breaks due to the juicy noodles. It didn't had any polythene pack.
The taste was apt, juicy, well cooked chicken pieces on a bed of noodles and covered with white sauces.",2,"2019-05-02 16:43:01",122,4865,1
"29027266","Totally different concept. Taste was ok,not up to the mark. After looking at the menu, I had lot of expectations, they could have been way better in terms of taste and quantity for the price. I have tried Sicilian chicken noodles (ordered via Zomato). I am planning to visit personally and try out few more options. Once I visit,Will update my review accordingly.",2,"2019-05-01 18:05:28",42,615,2
"1222280","To start on positive points nice concept, best staff members and decent sitout. But there is no taste? Favours are missing!!! U need to work on it. The noodles quality has to improve,very thick and doesnt hold favour of the sauces feels like ur eating a raw boiled noodles. Then sauces mei goreng should b the favour of garlic and soy u ruined it with complete soy sauce""anything too much will spoil the taste"". Chicken 65 is indo Chinese dish didnt expect u will mess that to there should always be right pinch of salt to do wonders"" no salt or more salt makes the dish worst"". Best was sicilian right amount of garlic and chillie flakes but again noodles thick ness spoiled the fun of it... Please take then as my suggestions... Al da best team keep going....

"3086309","Thought of visiting this place today (that I see everyday) instead of cooking. Man, I cook so much better!
We ordered Thai curry noodles and Abesto noodles, both with vegetables. Disappointment hit when there was a overload of peas and corn and NO other vegetables, which wasn't informed at the time of ordering that too when vegetables cost ADDITIONAL 30 rupees per serving. Noodles were too thick, like spaghetti and my portion lacked salt. Flavour wasn't that good either to get us back to this restaurant. Abesto was slightly better than Thai curry.
On the positive side, people running this place are humble. Concept of self-a and serving in the takeaway container is nice. ",2,"2019-04-26 21:28:16",16,36,1
"34667795","Really did not like the arribrrata noodles. Not worth the price of 147 per serving. It was oilly, overwhelming tomato flavor. And noodles are thick and hard. ,,😢☹️",1,"2019-04-25 13:33:17",8,8,0

"136022","Visited this place about a couple of hours ago. I got to hand it to them about the concept. It's taking people's favorite flavours and giving by mixing noodles in the same. The offerings are quite tempting. So, I ordered Mei Goreng and 65 Chicken. Chose them because they're the basic foods that go well with noodles. They got one thing right, i.e., serve it super hot. But what was forgotten was that it has to be delicious too. The noodles used quite thick and didn't take in any flavor. I'd never want to step into it again.",2,"2019-04-20 21:35:35",10,654,1
