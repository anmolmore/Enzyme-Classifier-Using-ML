"2717132","The Glass Onion is located at a calm and a quiet place. Despite being around a km behind Infosys, the place gives it an advantage of switching away from city chaos and you needn't be bothered about finding a place for parking. While the restaurant does offer valet, but the parking area next to the restaurant is huge and you can easily get a place there.
Once you enter the restaurant you're floored by the grandness of the place as it comes as something unexpected. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Owing to the summers, we opted for indoor seating. The tables are well spaced and there's enough distance between the adjacent tables to give you a premium experience.
The servers are well groomed, attentive and make good recommendations basis the specialities of the restaurant and after checking your preference. For starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti Kebab and Nachos. The Kebabs were well cooked and though a little spicy left a good after taste. The Nachos were light, crispy and had good amount of toppings. Despite Nachos being one of the common starters, I'd still recommend people to try the ones here.
For the main course we ordered the Lahori Paneer Combo that gets served with a small bowl of Dal Makhni and Naan/Pulao. The Paneer too tasted very good and had the right amount of spices which blended well with the Paneer. The Dal Makhni that came along with the Paneer was out of this world. It's a pity that it doesn't get served separately, but upon request the servers certainly obliged by offering another small bowl of the same. For something that's prepared so well, I feel that the patrons should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu.
Finally the dessert. Tiramisu pastry. Simply no words. Right amount of sweetness, well blended flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee. After a good dinner, the Tiramisu sealed the deal for us to be one completely satisfied customers.
One small observation that I'd still like to add is that despite a good number of servers, they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the tables start getting full. Towards the end we had to remind them about the dessert and it was evident that they had missed bringing it. However considering that they were attentive and friendly for most of our time there, I wouldn't penalize the restaurant with a star but would request to keep a check on the observation and continue to maintain the quality of the food to keep ensuring repeat visits.

"51227263","Truly a hidden gem. This place is situated far from the city, inside Emaar courtyard. The have both indoor and outdoor seating, and the ambience is the best part about this place. Its just amazing. 
The food was also great. Something that good be improved is the customer service. There is a bit of delay in getting the orders. 
Top Picks :
- Mint Cooler
- Chicken BBQ Pizza
The ambience will offset the price you pay. Overall, a must visit place.",5,"2019-05-12 16:32:29",57,513,5
"41532729","This place looks really nice with some good music. They have both outdoor and indoor seating facility and it's a best place to hangout with the family and friends. Outdoor seating has an amazing view of the Golf ground and can be enjoyed during evening.
They welcomed us with a welcome drink which was really nice.
First we ordered Screw Driver, Tropical Delight and Mint Cooler which was really good.
Screw Driver - It was a Cocktail which contains Vodka and Orange juice.
Tropical Delight - It had Orange, Pineapple, Mango and cream which taste differently. I personally liked that blend but my friends didn't. I would rate 3.8/5.
Mint Cooler - It is just normal Virgin Mojito what we gets in other places as well. Nothing special was not their. 3.5/5
For Starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti which was ok ok. The kulcha was bit hard so that we need to chew it more. 3.4/5
Next we ordered BBQ Roasted Chicken pizza which was good. The pizza was properly cooked but bit burned at the end which can happen. But that was covered by the taste. 4/5
Overall the experience was really good and it is located in a calm area where we can sit and enjoy with our kids or family or friends.
Overall - 4.6/5",5,"2019-05-12 15:58:51",1,2,6
"38598358","The place was in a very high end location. The ambience was not up to the mark. The service seemed pretty hostile when we asked them basic questions. And when we asked them to pack some of the remaining food, they didn't seem too happy about it. The appetizers and soup were good, but the quantity was too little. We ordered the ""Classic Mezeh Platter"" and when asked for some pita bread, the waiters frowned upon us and did not give us an appropriate response. Overall the place is overpriced and the service needs to be improved.",2,"2019-05-12 08:38:40",2,6,0
"39988050","Visited glass onion a month back. The restaurant is very close to office, inside premises of Emmar boulder hills. We went with office colleagues on a celebration treat.
Ambience was really good. We had experience of both indoor and outdoor dining. Outdoor dining truly outscored indoor experience.
Food was good but a bit higher on the price looking at portion size. We ordered Mediterranean platter, Bruschetta for vegetarians. The mocktails were nice.
It was couple of days before elections and apparently alcohol was not to be served. What really impressed me was that they followed rules. That's really good to see.
For main course we ordered a north indian combo, a very customised pasta and couple more things. They tasted good. Deserts were good but served delayed.
Overall nice experience.",4,"2019-05-12 05:13:53",3,2,0
"27917007","Place is cozy, peaceful and beautiful. Food is 4.5/5. Ambiance 5/5. Service 4.5/5. Good place to visit with family, friends or team. We tried their special nachos, 5 spice chicken kebab and Atishi murg tikka.",5,"2019-05-11 23:07:42",2,1,2
"34487289","2 stars for the place for rest 3, need good food, service, presentation and experience 
Lets start with the good part for which the two stars. 
Ambience , location and the place is amazing nothing like other places in hyd. The rain today made it even better. Outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe.
Thats it to the place and good part!
Service was bad, food was ok. If a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem. Buying water is a choice not force. Doesn’t matter if you are local udipi or a five star. We were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy. While leaving we did see other tables served normal water.
We did have zomato gold to use, but the experience was not so great to use it. First turnoff , dont have kingfisher beers.
We ordered veg tandoor platter, margherita pizza , tiramisu and cheesecake.
Pizza was the best part and yet i would say a 3.5/5. Generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count. We asked for mustard and denied.
The platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato. Whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side. Extra chutney took forever to come.
Tiramisu was average will not try again or recommend 
Cheesecake was pretty bad. Packed to throw i guess. The blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. The creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.
They gave a birthday brownie, Which frankly was average too. However, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. WTF!!!!!
Overall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks. Hop to jonathans for food or some place in indiranagar.",2,"2019-05-11 22:12:20",38,43,7
"2656702","A classy place with fantastic ambience.The decor was lovely. A perfect place with indoor and outdoor seating options. Ordered Chicken wings- which were perfectly cooked with the right amount of flavours infused. Tempura prawns were okay. Can give it a miss. Lotus stem galouti kabab- mildly spiced, well cooked and melts in the mouth. Ordered Chettinad chicken Indian tray. It was amazing! Sundried tomatoes chicken pasta was made perfectly. Ordered Goey chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and tiramisu. Both of them were perfect.

Last but not the least - ‘The Food’
I can still recall the tempting taste left on my tastebuds while stepped out that night.

"2604602","I went there with my office colleagues. The ambience is good. The music played is little loud, may be volume can be reduced a bit so that we do not need to about while speaking.
About food, quality of food is good, but waiters need to be taught that when four people order two different dishes, all those to be served at same time. What happens was, we two finished out veg food and the nob veg waa not even delivered when we finished our veg food.
We ordered Lotus stem Galouti, the taste of Galouti was good, but keeping one small kulcha was not going well. I know it must be an experiment, but I guess it is not working out as it was not going well with Galouti.
So, overall, good for one time.",3,"2019-05-05 12:35:35",4,8,0
"466559","I really like this place and I've been there multiple times. The best part is the ambience which is just really classy.

"33180314","Talk about a perfect date night and The Glass Onion is the best decision to go for. With amazing music, perfect view of the golf course, beautiful seating arrangements and sophisticated ambience made the night worth remembering. The New York cheesecake (with blueberry sauce) was good, but I won't deny that I have tasted better cheesecakes before. We ordered one pizza which, was quite filling and with generous amount of smoked and mozzarella cheese was enough for two. Special shoutout to the manager and the head waiter (I apologize I don't remember his name, but he definitely needs some appreciation. I remember he said he was from Delhi and also Kolkata) who was very courteous and offered us a complementary dessert. This definitely made our night because it tasted so good. The menu might be little overpriced according to many but for us with smart selection of dishes, it was not a hole in the pocket. Overall, it was an outstanding visit. A small suggestion, if they could include candle dining,that would elevate the romantic ambience of the place.",5,"2019-05-04 17:14:00",6,46,2

"35765355","Avoid this place in summer due to outside seating. They do not even have coolers in such weather outside and it is an expensive place. Not worth",1,"2019-04-29 18:40:32",6,14,0
"29025918","We visited the restaurant yesterday. We got outside table as all insides were reserved. Being 42 degrees outside, they only had fans running in such upscale restaurant and mist fans. They are charging 1400 RS for buffet and is considered upscale restaurant. Quite amazed on how upscale restaurants cannot afford coolers. Felt bad for waiters also as they were fully sweating and running around..I had same experience few months back. We went in th evening and it rained. We took the outside seating due to nice weather plus all the water was gushing inside and they had nothing to prevent that. I liked the food here but if management can't simply think abt service, I am sure we can figure out other places to eat.",2,"2019-04-29 18:31:03",4,3,0
"2208232","Why Glass Onion 🍚🍚: This place was trending on zomato ever since it has openned and it has gained the popularity in very short span of time. So, I was having an eye on it and finally felt delighted after visiting it at Saturday Night🌙.
Ambience⛲ : Oh Wobby !😍 Beautify ambience with indoor/outdoor sitting options and spread accross huge space. Its situated inside the boulder hills and hence the area is very peaceful and calm. You need to have a reservation for outdoors as this place is mostly filled with people
Service & Food : Super fast service and sumptous food. Period.

"27793195","Can improve your main course and desserts spread. I would have rated 3 but I am giving a 1 because one of your servers' behavior was bad in our office party. When my friend asked for a blue lagoon, he insulted him in front of everybody by saying that blue lagoon is for kids, not men... just because it's a soft drink.

"1614248","First time experience at this place was very good. Nice ambience, right from entry to the different seating areas offering different kind of ambiences. The food we ordered was also tasty. We had the veg Mezze platter and kungpao chicken as starters. Both were well made though quantity could have been a little more for the price they charge!
The main course was a custom made ravioli pasta in mixed sauce which was very good and a stir fry veg Udon noodles. 
They can improve on service a bit as no one bothered to serve us food..not even first time! 
Would like to go back again to enjoy the outdoor ambience next time where they played loud music..but looked like a good place to relax..",4,"2019-04-25 09:53:45",13,24,0

"29619888","I will start off by talking about it's ambience and location which I believe (and am sure most will agree) are it's highlights. Located inside the serenity of Boulder hills ,away from the hullabaloo of the busy city ,it offers a sense of calm. The simple yet elegant decor , is what clicked for me right from the moment I walked in. It has both and indoor and outdoor sitting. The indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit, I would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer. The streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it , definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink. I visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least. Now coming to the food and beverages part, definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all VIP locality . The cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu. And yes they have a novel concept of High tea served along with alcoholic beverages , which is served during the early hours of the evening (4-7 pm) , with the set up they have I believe this is a must try. Overall it's a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon or evening , with family or friends.
P.S. Don't go there looking for dance and high pitch music, you might be disappointed. ",4,"2019-04-24 23:10:45",5,55,0

"31535308","As far as date nights are considered there is music, lovely ambience, tables over looking a golf course and of course some rains to give you respite from the hot summer. This was my dinner night with Naina at Glass Onion, a beautiful restaurant at Boulder Hills, Hyderabad. The best thing is definitely the vast lush green golf course which gives joy and you are definitely chilling out at the finest properties in Hyderabad.
.
Let’s take the food starting right off with beer battered fish and pizza it was all perfection at affordable rates. The beer battered fish was soft and finely fried. Lovely textures I must tell. Pizza was thin crusted and we chose a veggie pizza, called Four Cheese Pizza! Yea as you wonder it has all the right mix of different types of cheese and we just loved it. A classic wood fired pizza flocks!!
.
The penne had an attractive aroma when it reached our tables, and I must say I forgot to even take a better picture before we start digging in. It was delicious and completely uplifted the mood. We surely had our drinks to give us great company and must tell ya, the Stallion a whiskey based cocktail made with passion fruit, lemon juice and grapes were simply fantastic. Make sure to use your Zomato gold in good use here.
.
The cherry on top was Apple pie our parting order, such a warm dessert served with delicious custard sauce, almond praline topped of with vanilla flavoured icecream. We surely enjoyed this dinner and this place is a great find  for couples to have a romantic dinner.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating at this place. We chose to sit outside as it got a beautiful view and it was just amazing with the view and the weather. 
There is quite a large selection of food from Italian, continental to Indian. We ordered for some starters from which we really like Bakchoy fry and also Malai Broccoli, chilli potato and Red chilli chicken were really nice and if you like to have some soup I would definitely suggest hi for Broccoli soup. For the Main course we ordered some White sauce pasta, Grilled chicken with Lemon Butter Garlic Sauce, Vegetarian Fried rice and my favorite Pork Spare Ribs which was just Scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork. We also ordered a cheese platter with wine and I would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine. 
We had less food and lot of alcohol but people who are going only to eat some food it’s really not that expensive and it’s totally worth it for the view and for the food.

If you are a pasta lover, then do order white sauce pasta.
It tasted incredibly hot and yummy.
As we visited this place for lunch, we had afternoon fizz mocktail with chill coconut and very different flavors of taste.
We wrapped up having sea salt Nutella dessert which was heaven of Nutella and different taste.

"37981430","Visited the place on a Saturday ! We had reservations made for 8pm and reached at around 8:20pm, only to receive a disapproving look by the lady and were told that it is difficult to hold a table this long! The entrance gave a deserted look and we were thinking why is this female so arrogant. Thereafter we got to know the real story as we moved towards the seating area. The place was well lit, with a posh ambience, perfect seating and tranquil yet charming environment. Really loved the idea of the hanging plants amidst the lights.
We ordered Lotus stem galauti kebab, kung paw chicken, teriyaki mushroom. The starters were delicious especially the chicken. Beware of the cocktail as you might be in for some surprises.
Ordered stir fried udon Noodles for main course. Although a bit oily, it was tasty, full of vegetables ! The dark brownie ordered as desert was mouth watering, the taste lingers.
The staff is courteous and the Vallet very kind and amazing person :)

We had non veg platter, veg platter , classic chicken burger ( this tasted yum), pathari ghosh, bangok spicy rice bowl non veg ( interesting and a tasty treat) however there are fewer options for veg and menu can be improved.
Mocktails very not upto mark and definetly not worth the amount you pay for any of those options as were any other items so please note that its a pricey affair. Service was as usual nothing much to be praised about. Overall

"39588579","It's a must try place in Hyderabad. Located in boulder hills, this place is spacious and has a golf course in vicinity. The USP of the place is definitely the ambience. The large open area and also the pricey bar counter stacked with expensive liquor. Ideal place for a romantic candlelit dinner. The place reverberates the screech of birds at night and the experience is surreal. We ordered pizza and chicken wings and a couple of drinks. Food was average but the ambience is mind blowing",4,"2019-04-12 22:57:01",7,12,0

"4009521","It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place. I reserved a table for us on the same day itself. To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.
verdict -  on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. Very dissappointing indeed. ",1,"2019-04-06 21:26:12",4,38,0
"1003847","When I entered the place I was impressed with the interiors and how huge the place was. What I really liked about the place was that it has a good veg menu as well. We had ordered for a Mac n Cheese Steak. I felt all the items on the plate were dry items be it the grilled vegetables or the Patty or The Pulao Rice, there should’ve been some kind of gravy or dip with these items or else the dish tasted good. We had also ordered for a Spaghetti Aglio Olio. So the Spaghetti that they serve here is wheat spaghetti we didn’t really like how it tasted. When we informed the management about the Spaghetti, they immediately changed it with Spinach Ravioli. The Ravioli tasted really nice, the rich garlic flavour of this dish with pine nuts was a perfect blend. 
Over all the experience was a really nice.  Definitely a must visit.",4,"2019-04-04 10:07:10",11,191,1

"32331267","Vegetarian Review ~
Hopped in on a day before Holi for dinner and unfortunately it was a dry day. Survived with food that day. It's on the road to isb and is spread on a huge area with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements while is outdoor has the view of the golf course and if the weather is great, this is the best place to be. Light music playing through the night was soothing.
We ordered lotus stem galouti with cheese kulcha, Korean waffle fries, veg penne Alfredo pasta and apple pie.
Lotus stem galouti - The galouti tasted great with the flavours of Vegetables and didn't taste much of lotus stem and went well with green chutney and cheese kulcha.
Waffle fries - The waffle had lot of honey, sesame and soy and garlic with a burnt taste. The waffle wasn't crispy and the didn't wasn't that great for my taste buds.
Alfredo pasta - The pasta was creamy and had all the veggies, the consistency was good and it tasted well overall.
Apple pie - This was star of the night for me with the pie tasted great with the falvours of apple and cardamom and the icecream was cheery on the cake and the whole dessert was mouth watering and heart filling.
The staff is good and friendly, I remember being the last one to exit and they were still nice. Keep up the good service. The whole order was around 1400 bucks which is a bit expensive for without alcohol but you get a dining experience and embience so good.
Overall a great place for some drinks and great conversation. Ideal for romantic dates and celebrations. The whole embience is calm and peaceful and makes it best among all @theglassonion ",4,"2019-04-02 10:57:22",174,1282,7

The food is over priced and the quantity they give us is way too less. We ordered the lamb lasagna and we literally had ONE piece of lasagna which really shocked me. Then we had the chicken steak which was decent - nothing special. We gave up on their main courses so went straight to desserts. We ordered the warm apple pie, cheesecake, and the Brazilian chocolate cremeux. The chocolate dessert tasted old, the cheesecake was a thin slice of sadness, but the warm apple pie was very good.
