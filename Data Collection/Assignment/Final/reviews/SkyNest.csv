1. Masala papad was just fried papad with onion, chilli, tomato chopped on top, no taste of any masala, not even lemon.
2. Biryani, which took 40 mins to come to table was terrible tasting, more like chicken pulao than biryani and was definitely not freshly made to order.
3. During the whole 1 hour that we had to spend there, constant fight was going on in kitchen, manager scolding the staff, staff arguing etc that made the whole experience terrible.
4. The service was exceptionally slow, considering the fact that, other than us, just one more seat was occupied.
5. They took 15 mins to get soft drinks, 20 mins to get masala papad and 40 mins for Biryani, each item after we complained of delay.
All in all, food was not worth the wait and restaurant was not worth the experience.",2,"2019-04-11 14:37:31",40,32,4

"31999137","No need to look beyond if you have a taste bud for authentic and tasty cuisines along with proper hygiene. One of the very few places in Hyderabad where even a typical nonvegeterian like me is willing to go for a vegetarian dish. Hara Bhara Kabab is one of the must tries.
A highly recommended place if you are looking for some great food and service in an around the Cyberabad corridor.",5,"2019-01-22 15:07:15",6,25,3
