"29194757","Have visited the place several times and have found the buffet spread to be quite reasonable. Being vegetarian the food options are few however the options are always good when compared to most places. It was a very pleasant experience today with the staff and the manager Sushil being extra courteous and inquiring about our likes and additional options if we needed any. They were quick to notice that the food I took was very little. Even though I had nothing to complain about and out of choice I ate little, the staff and the manager Sushil did check several times if I needed anything extra or special and kept reiterating that I needn’t compromise on my food. It was extremely thoughtful and polite on their part to extend such hospitality even though there was nothing to complain about. Overall the food was good, always enjoy the Chinese food options here, the only feedback would be on the veg paneer vegetable which had a slight raw red chilli flavour else everything was good. Enjoyed the visit. ",4,"2019-04-28 22:48:14",7,1,0

"49771171","Surprisingly the food at Gachibowli’s Citrus Cafe @Lemon Tree is below average. The Dum Biriyani was too spicy which is not the same that I have regularly at Hitech City Center. The saviour was Dal Makhani, which was yummy as usual. 
The positive part is chef taking responsibility.",2,"2019-04-22 22:31:44",2,11,0

Had my lunch and dinner here: lunch was ok but dinner was pathetic, the buffet had issues, firstly the food was not cooked well and secondly after complaining about it instead of saying don't have and we will arrange something, they started offering us dessert for free. I was like...why would you do so when your food isn't good.
Very dissatisfied with their service and food. ",2,"2019-04-20 23:25:52",49,73,0

Tried a veg anjeer and khubani subzi which was simply amazing and another of their recommendation. The service is impeccable. While the order get slightly delayed, they were kind to let us know that it was getting delayed since they were also setting up the lunch buffet.

"502571","Had a very disappointing experience, both in terms of food as well as service. There was very limited variety in the buffet. There were only 2 starters(each for veg and non-veg) in a buffet costing 1000+ and nothing tasted good. The starters were served cold and when asked the staff to bring hot ones, they did not even respond to the request. Main course had some options available but quality wise and taste wise, not even one dish was good. Coming to desserts, this was the most disappointing section as everything was looking and tasting like week old preparations. There were 4-5 options and we could not even finish 1 piece of any of the items. At last, they brought ice-cream on request and even that had pieces of ice. Overall could not find even 1 dish which was up to the mark.

We took spaghetti aglio e olio and a medium-rare tenderloin steak for main course. While the spaghetti was decent in taste, the steak was well done and hence extremely chewy. Moreover, they didn't have steak knives, and I had a really hard time cutting the stiff steak with a normal butter knife. However, upon pointing this out, the staff members were extremely apologetic, and they were sweet enough to provide us with complimentary desserts. Overall, it was a good experience.
I have a suggestion for the management: while you guys have an excellent chef, you might want him to improve his steak making skills :)",4,"2018-12-30 14:16:27",29,131,2

Food, Naah! This place is not meant for it. All you get is beautiful view, the pool, paintings.You need to be here to enjoy the ambiance.
In the Lunch buffet you have everything from soups to desserts but with less varities and a berry flavour mocktail.
In Soups: Tomato soup/ Chicken soup with bread and butter. Depends on  how you want to eat it.
Starters had just four things: Veg cheese balls, Califlower with carrot tossed in pepper n  slightly fried, Chicken tossed in green chutney, Fish fry. no mutton nor prawns. 
Main course had lot of things:  Fish curry, Chicken curry, Fish pulusu, Dal, Zeera Rice,Steamed Rice, Sambar, Paneer curry, Aloo Peas, Roti, Chicken Dum Biryani, Veg Noodles, Manchuria, Dahi vada, Curd rice, Varities of salad. Papad and Fries, Chat mixture.Totally disatisfied with this we asked them to get us some Mutton Biriyani and mutton Curry,finally something that made us kind of happy.
Dessert: Rasgulla, Ajmeri Kalakand, Dal halwa, Gelabi, Lemon Cake, Chocolate/Black forest cake, Smoothie, Ice cream, Fruits.
To be frank nothing was good except the Veg cheese balls and Fish fry and yes the pink berry lemon crush. Rest all were so incomplete. Each of them had something missing. The flavour, the thickness in gravy,it had nothing.
Go and vist Lemon Tree for sure or try out a different restaurant there but this wasn't worth satisfying our hungry bellies.",3,"2018-10-20 02:45:30",139,663,6

"8267981","This is a restaurant space inside the Lemon Tree Hotel.
Ambience & Amenities:
It has a very cozy and sophisticated ambience. All the decors, hangings and wall paints in the walkway into the restaurant are an eye candy. The lighting inside the restaurant make it look very elegant and it has a very facilitated seating.
Food:
I really loved the food here. Though there are limited options for vegetarians, All the Non-veg starters are luscious and I really enjoyed veg cheese balls as well. About the main course the Mutton Biryani was yummy. Both Dal Makhani and Avadhi Paneer tasted best with steamed rice. Basil Garlic Noodles was not that great and it tasted quite better with the combination of gratinated vegetable.
About the desserts there is nothing exciting or new to try out here and it is really disappointed everyone of us. And all the salads both Veg and Non-veg are really great and they delicious with a creamy dressing. Overall I finally feel that vegetarian menu should have been little better.

Service:
The service here is very much appreciable. And they really maintain all the standards. They're very cordial and always available at your service just a call away.
Value for Money:
This restaurant has very good value for money for Non-vegetarians but if you're a vegetarian you have to think twice. The buffet here costs Rs.899 + Tax. And there are also corporate discounts available and we made it for Rs. 800 including Taxes.

The clear noodles soup was tasteless and viscous. The main course was ok - the breads were chewy.

Made with all fresh ingredients the taste of the food served was good. Fish with basil which was served as a starter was a little greesy for me. I have liked the Fish Salad though. The highlight dish in starters was surprisingly veg cutlet which was soft and melted in my mouth. Perfect balance of salt and other ingredients. Mutton biryani tasted good not a wow however good. What tickled my taste buds was green chocolate mousse a big wow wow wow to this dessert. As this is a buffet there were lots of dishes in the menu for dinner and my tummy could not justify all the dishes. I am reviewing only those I tasted.

My kids, my wife and myself we are foodie, we do outing atleast once a week. And I am sure citrus cafe lemon tree at gachibowli just got black listed in our list. Their buffet was so COLD like it was cooked years back and they are just trying to make them warm by flame. they had veg spring roll in starter I'm sure no human can eat if you are paying for that. Same goes with NON-Veg starters. Even to get naan we had to follow up with the servers number of times. You won't trust but in the end my wife and I just had fruits' salad and came back to home. 2nd thing which I did NOT like they charged like 10% without informing me. WTF!

We thought of celebrating our wedding anniversary there but the overall stuff turned me off. We go outside for dinner every weekend and sometime to check new restaurants as well , if we found it good will included in our revisit list but for this one A BIG NO. .I felt like wastage of money. You can get many other good option in the city under this amount. And on top that apart from GST they charged 10% service tax without letting us know. One can not charge ST without customer confirmation.",1,"2017-11-30 19:11:35",2,18,0

"47699059","We visited this place mainly for lunch buffet with our clients due to its location . Their services are very slow and the supervisor who was having smile on his face had no interested in taking care customers. Starter and food was completely cold and even after making complaint about it the supervisor in lemon yellow shirt just gave a smile and did nothing as if it was intentional,  it seems he must be having his own issues with management but customer gets a very bad impression . It was the worst experience I ever had in a restaurant of Lemon Tree.
Lunch Buffet - 2.5/5 (starters were few and cold completely tasteless)
Ambience - 4/5
Services- 1/5 
Location - 4/5
Advice to management - Serving staff can be trained and supervisors should take interest in their job and atleast can do the minimum expected from them. Name of the supervisor should be displayed on his shirt so that they will be careful not to mistreat customer else can be accountable. Please provide your management contact information if customer has to make any complaints there is no phone number or mailid given  on your website. Never expected this from Lemon Tree which has many chain of branches .Put CCTV camera in buffet  lunch area to monitor how your staff is doing.",2,"2017-11-02 12:56:00",9,1,0

"30901168","The breakfast buffet was delicious and could be customised as per taste. The best thing about Citrus Cafe is that they encourage specially-abled staff. 
Offers a variety of breakfast cereals, south-indian delicacies, desserts and juices to complement your mornings. I tried Dosa, uttapam and coconut milk to begin with and indulged in my sweet-tooth affair with tempting desserts. So, to start your beautiful day in Hyderabad with yummylicious breakfast, you can give this cafe a shot. Bon appétite! 👍😊",4,"2017-08-07 13:09:01",22,71,0

"30807692","We stayed at Lemon Tree Hotel, Gachibowli on our two days visit to Hyderabad. Most of the time we dined outside because we were in other parts of the city, looking around. But, we didn't miss on the complimentary breakfast that was offered. The buffet is huge as the taste is great! You get for North Indian, South Indian as well Continental dishest for breakfast which are always served hot!
Well, myself being from Northern part of the country, don't really get to taste the authentic flavours of the south because it is mostly added with some flavours of north to suit our taste buds. But, the place being in South India provides the best flavours of the south. Loved the Andhra Sambhar that they served and also varieties of chutneys to go along!
We also had dinner once which we ordered in for room service which consisted of one veg and one non veg dish (local cuisine of Andhra). I would update the names of the dishes once I get to remember them. So, about the dishes, they had so many flavours to offer and the taste was much different from all the curries that we have in the North!
I loved the place. Apart from food, the service is great and staffs are always more than ready to help!",4,"2017-07-22 07:39:29",10,65,0

The main course was also limited but good in quality. I specifically liked the desserts here. Overall the place is just apt for official purposes. Nevertheless it serves best to its requirement.

The ambience, staff, cleanliness and the variety all are super good.
The live counter is also exciting.
My fav was paratha sabji sausages cheese omelet  with fresh juice and some fresh cut fruits early morning in the breakfast.
The most exciting part for the buffet dinner was the Chinese preparations in the buffet, believe they are awesome, chicken Mongolian my all time fav. Mutton, biryani, paneer everything was perfectly cooked.
A must try for all!",4.5,"2017-05-13 19:34:57",148,524,3
"1473719","Had been there for breakfast on Sunday morning with a friend of mine. Right at the corner of financial district, stands this business hotel  used by many IT companies in the IT hub of Hyd. 
The spread was good...variety was such that even 1 portion each was enough to take care of lunch and evening snacks... 6 variety of healthy drinks... from grape juice to vanilla milk...flavored curd (kiwi was too sweet)....cabbage paratha (no man)... the guy made paneer partha for me.. it was really good. 
Baked beans was okay...not that tasty...muffins were freah, but they ran out of donuts, so couldn't taste.
Vada and Pungullu was very very soft and melted as you take in your mouth...
Felt guilty of eating calories ... to cheat my conscious had idly, curd and lots of fruits... lol.

"4045251","When tired, hungry and not sure what to eat, a buffet saves the day :) And it did to me one evening after a rather harrowing and long day in office. I was in Hyderabad on work and my company put me up in Lemon Tree. By the time I finally managed to check-in, freshen up and come down to Citrus for my dinner, I could have eaten a camel. Figuratively, of course. My first impression of the restaurant was positive. The ambiance was good, lighting apropos, décor pleasant. The furniture is comfortable and spaced sufficiently apart; moving around between the serving area and the tables is easy. The buffet area is fairly good. A pretty big ‘U’ with a central island between the ‘U’ for salads/ desserts/ juices et al. depending on the meal you are having. Found the staff to be very courteous and prompt to requests. The food is great. I won’t say it is out of the world but not down in the pits either. The buffet spread is large enough and you will find something or the other you will like. The Indian preparations was great but the Chinese were more Indian than Chinese. The famed Hyderabadi Biryani was a let down – I am not so sure it could stand up to the reputation. Nevertheless, in general, I found the food and the palate to be a little more than satisfactory. As for cost of the buffet, it is in line with the rest. For two of us, it costed me INR 1900. The breakfast buffet was good although I did see items not being refilled promptly. Found the poori aloo and vada sambar excellent. There’s a live egg counter but unless you know about it, it is likely you will miss it. Overall, a good experience. If you haven’t being there yet, it is most certainly worth a visit.",3.5,"2017-02-18 16:01:58",87,249,0

Dinner buffet speak was okayish expected some different varieties of spreads, totally tainted by looking at the items. Buffet area was so congested that people have to wait in queues. Items would disappear in a blink of an eye. Waited long for the items to arrive. Need to improvise on the buffet spread.",3,"2017-02-08 14:37:52",19,20,8
"75898","Been there for a team lunch. The buffet spread was ok as I felt the varieties were less. Ambience was ok, just like any other big hotel chain. No surprises there as it was expected. I felt that the service could improve a little as time and again some of the dishes were vanishing from the buffet.
Please consider this review for veg section only as I'm veggie and as we went there on Thursday, most were ""faithfully"" veggie.
Starting with starters and soups, I liked the soup and tikki+green chutney in starters.
Coming to main course, I didn't had courage to taste the baigan dish, but the paneer curry was ok and satisfied my taste buds. In desserts, kheer was good and Cham Cham as well. I also liked the lime water which they keep in salad section. I didn't try the live counter as frankly speaking I never understood it's purpose and why people craze for that uncooked raw type stuff and that too without spices.

I am regretting to write a negative things about my fav place and this is about the reception we got. We booked a table for 6 and once we arrived no one sure about our booking and not a single person is ready to accompany us. Upon asking one bearer helped us to find our seats and what a bearer can do if managers are not helping us and all they can do is just roaming. Once we made red face all managers showed much love on us who did not care a single moment for us during our arrival. This place meant for only in stay people I guess as they are treated much better than outside persons. All my lower rating is only for reception we got.",2,"2016-11-28 17:18:14",70,529,0

The main course was not as per expectation. They had salmon fish in main course which was over and we had to ask them for refill. That particular dish tasted so creamy with the correct amount of all it's ingredients in place and for the same it was preferred by the people.
