    "Hi all,\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back. Often during data collection, scraping static webpages using tools like R's rvest or py's beautiful_soup may simply not be enough for a number of reasons:\n",
    "* Because the target webpage is dynamic, \n",
    "* has hidden and changing content, \n",
    "* has [AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And XML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax%28programming%29) scripts running (which allows web pages to dynamically change content without needing to reload the entire page), \n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "When we navigate such a page, the page (and by extension the web application behind it) would require us to take a number of actions. Think of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clicking a button to load more content\n",
    "2. Refreshing old content\n",
    "3. Clearing search boxes prior to search\n",
    "4. Typing in search queries\n",
    "5. Choosing options from pulldown menus\n",
    "6. Scrolling \n",
    "7. Etc.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In such a scenario, would it not be great if we could launch a browser remotely and control actions to be taken to display the data we need, and then thereafter scrape the data? This is where webdrivers enter the picture. One of the best known is Selenium, which has interfaces both with R and py. Py is more stable with Selenium, so here we are.\n",
