Ordered dal fry and phulka that too with special instructions conveyed to the restaurant that this is for someone unwell.
And guess what they sent phulka which was made of maida, who does that. Phulka's are basic form of Roti which should be made of wheat floor. Nothing fancy. They were hard to chew because of, made of maida. That too the instructions were already given. Very disappointing üòî",1,"2019-02-21 14:01:09",37,94,0

"42927781","One of those kind of places which provides quality food and ambience, but equally poor and inefficient service.
Service-(1/5) They don't give any importance whether you want anything, or to take order.
Even they fill the water glass utmost half, don't provide finger bowl because it was crowded!!
The most worse part was they kept us waiting for almost 15 mins to bring the bill, which they eventually failed..Went to the main bill counter and asked- ""Do you want me to pay the bill or leave"". It was at that point of time that they provided me the bill.
They lack the skill to control the huge inflow of people.
Food-(4/5) Starter was okiesh average, but biryani was really good.
Ambience-(4/5) It was good, nice to have a place like this in DLF.
If the service would have been good, it would have turned out to be very good restaurant.",2,"2019-02-10 02:46:29",84,182,5

"35834054","Golconda Chefs : The literal hunger savior for me. They have a branch in madhapur(where I live) and have opened up here in Gachibowli (where I work).
Ambience in here is classic. There are only few places with such ambience in hyderabad that I found and this is one of them. They are at center of Gachibowli's IT hub,saving all the IT folks like me from high prices and providing tasty food.
I personally am a fan of their Chicken Roast Biryani. But they have mastered in Ulavacharu variety in this branch. This is crowded place on Fridays and the wait is worth.
Food wise Ulavacharu variety is a must try. They have unique flavored ""tadka"" biryani that too at such low price. Their service has quite shocked me becoz it was crowded and yet they managed the timing.

Finally a saviour for the people around DLF for Team Lunch/Dinner. We were there for a Team Dinner and are a group of 12. First impressions were very good, attractive and cool ambience. Very crowded, as it was Friday Night. Got our table after a wait time of 5 minutes.
Menu looks great. But we are a group of foodies, so asked the steward to tell about their specials. We almost ordered everything what he suggested. Had Chicken & Veg Manchow, Sweet Corn, Hot and Sour in soups. They were great, thick and piping hot. In the starters, had Apollo Fish, Loose Prawns, Chicken Majestic, Paneer Chilli, Egg Manchuria, Golden Fried Baby Corn. Everything tasted very good, loved them all. Was surprised with the quantity too.
In the main course went with Mutton Biryani, Chicken Dum Biryani Family, Kaju Paneer Biryani and Ulavacharu Egg Biryani.
Very much satisfied with all the Biryanis. That aroma of Hyderabadi touch can be felt in the Biryanis. I am a fan of Ulavacharu, loved the fried eggs in it. Chicken and mutton are perfectly cooked, with balanced spices.
I didn't feel any lag in the service even though it was crowded. Finally as we were a team, bagged 10% discount. Pricing is perfect for the quantity. In love with this restaurant. Hope they will continue the same. Thumbs Up.",5,"2018-10-12 02:24:40",189,1486,0

I don't know why people are given bad rating for this restaurant but for me my ordered dishes are very good.
I starters we ordered for chicken 555 and Prawns pepper, chicken 555 was good but not great and coming to Prawns pepper I did not expected such a awesome crispy prawns.Prawns pepper was really superb people has to try this dish if you visit this restaurant. There was no smell from prawns they were really fried very well. Finally we ordered for chicken handi quantity was fit for 3 people. Biryani was good enough with limited masala.
