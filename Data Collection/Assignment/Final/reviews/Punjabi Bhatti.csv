"29639498","HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!
I should have read the reviews before ordering from this place. But I was hungry as hell, hence overlooked the fact.
Ordered chicken methi, butter rotis and rose shake.
The management called several times with new excuses.
First, I got a call that they were able to arrange chicken after 1:45 though I placed the order at 1:10. They realised this so late.
After this, I get a call saying that rose shake is not available, hence I had to settle for badam shake.
Moreover, the lady who was from the management sounded rude.
When I finally received the order, after over an hour, I get this. The chicken curry doesn't look good from any angle. The rotis were so small in size that 4 won't be enough for any adult.
These guys are just cheating the customers and are not at all bothered about there reputation, which I believe after seeing so many bad reviews.
They deserve this.
JUST AVOID THIS PLACE!",1,"2017-06-05 15:09:29",158,228,1

"398915","AVOID THIS PLACE!!!
This was one of our drunken order mistake. A house party scene and late night hunger pangs. With most of the home delivery options closed out, this was only one delivering through Foodpanda at around 10.30 pm.
We ordered drumstick chicken, mughlai chicken and chappaties. The order delivery time was 45 min which was reasonable. Let's see what went wrong - everything after that.
Drumstick chicken: Deep fried chicken leg pieces with flour coating that was little too tangy for the palate. With oil content so high, I could have oiled my entire hair using that. 
Chicken mughlai: uncooked chopped onions with floating egg bhurji literally killed the gravy. Only good thing about the whole order was the chappaties.
Please refrain from ordering from this place. It is capable of ruining your dinner. ",2,"2016-12-30 19:55:14",155,1798,0

Ordered egg curry and egg masala both dishes did not satisfy my taste buds. Plain roti was too dry and not cooked properly.

The only good thing about this place is that you will get food here even at 2 in the morning and thus, it has gone and become my saving hunger-grace on quite a few occasions. Given that, it does not help excuse itself from the average taste in terms of food quality it offers. Which is way below par, given the competitive prices put forth.

"15826900","Was looking out to try a new place for some late night food tonight and ended up ordering from here as all other places were shut down and not many places left. This turned out to be disastrous and disappointing. 
Ordered mughlai chicken, butter and plain roti along with some punjabi lassi just an hr back.
Received the food within half n hr which was good. 
Here comes the sad part. The food wasn't even close to warm. And the lassi tasted really bad! It was sour. Roti was fine and manageable. The mughlai chicken was like one i have never seen, of all the places I have had mughlai chicken before. It was too oily, no taste and just plain rubber like chicken pieces not even properly cooked and just raw!
Never ever ordering from this place again.

So coming to the food, we ordered Gobi Manchuria, Matar Paneer, Dal Makhni and Egg fried rice. We had ordered Matar Paneer, as it was not available Zomato representative connected me with the owner and we agreed for Palak Paneer. But on delivery, I don't know what Paneer curry I received (shown in the pics). It had a sour taste and was average. Gobi manchuria was good with all the spices, garlic and it had lots of pieces. Dal makhni was also average, was not cooked completely. Egg fried rice had almost no egg and appeared stale. Probably my last order from here because of delay, different item delivered and quality of food was not up to the mark.

Very easy on the pocket and you get homely food. The veg is really good, would rate it (4.5/5). Non-veg is not the restaurants cup of tea I guess. Had ordered for Lemon Chicken, the quantity was explicit for the rate, the only draw back was no lemon flavour. It was more of onions and chillies. However on the other hand they did cover the blunder with they amazing Bhindi masala. The flavour is really good and it just promotes saliva buildup once in your mouth. I would rate the Bhindi masala a 5 on 5. Mushroom masala was good (4/5), Baighan ka Bharta (4/5), Roti (4/5).

"3830621","My regular place of eating for two reasons : Good food and as its very near to the place I stay. The real Punjabi spice. Very much a Budget-hotel. I just love the food here. I go there atleast once a week. It's just that after you Order, you will receive the food on to your table only after your next Birthday. So, when u at the neck of Hunger, I say try others. But If u have got all the time in the World, go for it and u will love it. And I shud mention, the Elevator is the best and you will enjoy it ;)",4,"2015-12-28 15:19:44",12,92,0
"16613158","My regular dining place on weekdays. The owner is very freindly and the food is also tasty. I always take veg for dinner (parcel sometimes) and the cost for 2 comes to less than 300.
Highly recommended for bachelors :-)",4,"2015-11-23 19:27:43",34,61,0
"949778","Online order on Foodpanda
I ordered Tandoori Chicken, Tandoori Roti, Plain Naan and Chicken Palak. Tandoori Chicken was replaced by Tangri Kebab due to non availability.
Tangri Kebab was undercooked. The roti and naan were extremely hard and inedible. Chicken palak was the only edible item and tasted ok.",2,"2015-11-22 12:45:50",8,174,0
"30768091","We ordered variety of items for dinner. It was home delivery. The food delivery was late by about an hour and the food tasted horrible. Roti's were like chewing rubber. Dal Makhni tasted bad. To top that egg curry did not have egg shell peeled off . It was pathetic. Also they forgot to send chicken curry in the order and then were not ready to admit it. If you think i am done, well while waiting for the chicken curry to come i just tasted the rajmah curry and found that it had chicken pieces at the end which i ate to believe it. I was astonished to see how careless they are. I am a non veg so it was ok for me but we had a pure vegetarian in our group also. What if he had eaten it. So, thank you but i wont order from here again.Â 
NOTE: I am still waiting for the missing chicken curry as i am writing this review.",1,"2015-11-01 22:17:48",1,3,1

"32062143","LITERALLY The worst food i have ever had and i mean it, never in my whole LIFE i had tasted anything worse, nothing else comes remotely close. I ordered 2 paneer dishes, hoping that the taste will match the name. But, it was my mistake to think that food was remotely edible, neither the chilli paneer nor the paneer butter masala was properly cooked, rather they were nowhere remotely near the taste one might expect from the said dishes. I wonder why do they name the restaurent punjabi bhatti when there is nothing ""punjabi"" in their food. But, seriously, NEVER ever order any paneer dishes from them.. Parathas were fine (read, average) though.",1,"2015-10-03 03:06:16",2,1,0
"2945828","Great North Indian food at very reasonable prices. Although the service took a little time because the place was pretty full on a Sunday evening, the taste was great.

"164501","Ahhhaa so finally I found a place here in hyderabad where I can have food like I always had. Proper home made food, no feel of restaurant to it, no spices. You won't even feel that you are having food outside your home. Tried variety of parathas, to name a few methi, aloo, paneer, onion. Liked methi one alot. Lassi served was in a big glass, enough to fill ur days need. And the best part is it was damm pocket friendly. The only pointer I deducted was for the ambience, else everything was very good.

"29223181","May be i am being too harsh on the review coz my first experience was not too pleasant. The food was delivered extremely late on our table, i am talking about 45 mins! We could clearly understand there were lack of efficient people working and they excused themselves saying that their usual chef is on a holiday and the person who usually manages the restaurant was sick. But that cant be an excuse of running inefficient service at a restaurant. 
I could realize its a popular eating joint by looking at the young crowd. The food was decent. Specially the methi chicken, jeera rice and chilli chicken. The parantha again was very hard and leathery. And its pretty cheap to have lunch or dinner on any regular day. ",3,"2015-08-26 11:06:41",36,114,0

The food ordered was 
1-Achari paneer
2-chicken rarra 
And rotis which was so soft and hot from the tawa that we remembered our home cooked food.
Definitely a place to go.
Rates are also very reasonable.",4,"2015-07-19 20:55:02",4,4,0

The whole experience of fooding over here is good. Plain and simple!
This place comes as a saviour on those days when you are dying to have good punjabi food at best price and that too from a nearby place. 
People who are staying near Gachibowli-Madhapur-Kondapur-Kothaguda cam easily visit this place at any point of time.

"2163210","I am actually editing my previous review which was about this place being an authentic north indian food joint, I am really surprised at the drastic change in their cooking...it has gone down like anything...the food that they are providing are not just too oily but also staled and tampered... I used to like their curries but recently they have not just deteriorated the taste but also the quality in terms of thickness. The other day I ordered Paneer butter masala, Baingan ka bharta and Bhindi masala...the peneer curry hardly had few panner chunks dat too as small as they could make it and the gravy was none other than their Kadai Paneer with two full spoons of sugar added into it...Bhindi was too oily and staled, like it was a left over from previous day...also the bhindis were not d raw ones, it was hard and there was more of onions than the vegetable itself....we could only gulp the baingan ka bharta which was also of very low standard...
This was my last order from this resturant..:(",1.5,"2015-06-03 01:31:50",25,24,0
