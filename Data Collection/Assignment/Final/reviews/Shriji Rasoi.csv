"114164","For the best food place with a north indian flavour and to have a feeling of a highway kind of dhabha Sriji Rasoi is the place. Hygiene and taste of food is really great. Sattu parantha is something to be tried over here and rest all the dishes are of the same level that would make you mouth watering once you think of this place ever again.

Just opposite to DLF tech park an amazing road side dhabba with great North Indian veg food. The food is filling, value for money and very tasty at the same time.
