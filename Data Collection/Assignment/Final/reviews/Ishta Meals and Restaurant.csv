"2977516","When on a trip to Hyderabad , my cousin suggested that this place has the best shawarma and being a shawarma lover , I badly wanted to try it !! 
So ordered it in @swiggy ..
The packing was so damn good.. wrapped In aluminium foil and packed inside a box.. it was a delight to open it ..
The shawarma was so juicy and fresh with lump sum amount of chicken .. the kubus was so fresh and soft .. 
no doubt that it’s one of the top three shawarma I’ve ever had .. ",5,"2019-01-14 15:09:13",38,229,0

Chicken fried rice and lassi
# Really disappointed with the given quantity it's a kind of cheating. For the amount they are charging quantity is really less.. I did not see such a low quantity for 100rs
At first I thought it was kind of some complimentary dish but it turned out to be the item I have ordered. If u can't provide enough quantity for the amount charged, then atleast include half and full quantities in the menu so that customer will have an idea and order according to that..

"42895792","I have ordered food from here several times and was never disappointed... Not just me but colleagues at my work place also love the food here... The owner is courteous and customizes the food according to our instructions.. Extremely pocket friendly and the biryani here is flavourful.. Cant compare it to hyd biryani though... But still provides great taste... As it is pocket friendly i almost order food during month ends... A definite place to try food from... The biryani feels like home made and they make it spicy if instructed... All in all i love the food here... ",4,"2017-11-28 12:39:39",111,1846,0
"35040934","The best place to get a biriyani from.
