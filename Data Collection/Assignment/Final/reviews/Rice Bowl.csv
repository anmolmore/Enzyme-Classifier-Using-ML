"34009097","Ordered via Swiggy and tried the Egg Kadai Masala Bowl. The rice used was Basmati (a brownie point for that) and the quantities of the rice and curry were good. Personally, I did not like the curry so much. It was bland, devoid of the 'masaledaar taste' that the name hints at. Not too good and definitely not the worst meal ever.

"48993007","I tried multiple options here from Veg, Non Veg & Egg. I suggest only the Egg rice bowls here as the veg and chicken ones didn't taste good even once. I think they can improve on the taste but considering their low pricing, I think they are trying to keep common gravy base for all/ most of the items that is not helping the experience. I can only say that try at least once and continue if you like as it is a value for money outlet.",3,"2018-09-15 00:57:34",137,1057,0

I ordered the Butter Chicken Rice Bowl and it was a disappointment. There were only gravy and the quality of rice was good and the rice tasted good. Somewhat i felt the butter chicken was not freshly made and may be from previous nights. There were 3-4 tiny, micro pieces of chicken. I understand that it was a combo plan and much cheaper. But people would expect at least inch sq pieces of chicken 4-5 pieces. The quality need to be improved.

"39360601","A highly disorganized and an irresponsible restaurant. 3 examples...
(1) They accept the order, tell you it is getting ready in the kitchen,... keep you waiting about an hour, you call Zomato and they contact the restaurant and they update back that the order is on the way. You wait for another 10 minutes and then call the restaurant, Zomato gets back to you and you have BREAKING NEWS :).... restaurant is 'Closed now' and that the 'order is rejected!'
(2) You order Sambar Rice with Boondi. You receive the item... only... they forgot to add the Boondi on it and replaced it with fried all...;)
(3) You order a Large Shahi Chicken rice bowl... We receive the item, when you ask the delivery boy, what's the item being delivered ... And he does not know it :))... And then you have a small bowl delivered!! Enough is enough. My next order is coming to you when I reach heaven!!

Plus points: quite cheap. Quality and quantity wise fine 
Minus: I ordered regular size alu matar rice bowl,it hardly had any alu! All I could find were carrots and beans. Personally I don't prefer much spice or gravy.But as I digged into the rice,all the rice was mixed with spicy gravy.

Service: 7/10 - its pre cooked - u get it instantly, n hot!!
Food: 7/10 - the added advtg of having fewer options in the menu is that the service is quick n usually food tastes good.. I ordered Butter Chicken. It was provided in a lovely little plastic take-away container and chicken pieces (boneless) r cut in small pieces - so u dont have to dirty ur hands - Ideal for quick bite or take away for a journey. The chicken pieces were tender n spicy. The gravy n pieces were delicious n were in ample amount even in the ""regular size rice bowl"".. prices r reasonable.

"27668","Seeing the rating i just ordered 3 vareities of rice bowls. Butter Chicken, Aloo Phool and Rajma. 
Food: The food was really good. The taste was perfect. The butter chicken one is the best. Decent amount of gravy infact exactly the amount to be mixed with rice. Lots of indian flavour. Did not see much of oil or ghee used so it was healthy. Rice was properly cooked.
Quantity and price: Quantity was awesome. One rice bowl can easily fill one person. Veg rice bowl will cost INR 60-70 and a non veg one will be INR 90-100. 
Recommendation: Please try to put in more variety maintaining the same quality.
I would have given this place 3.5 but because of the quantity and price .5 extra.
Please try it.",4,"2016-04-30 15:25:09",35,241,1

"324047","If u wanna grab a quick grub in ur office break and are tired of eating the same stuff at the office cafeteria then rice bowl might just save you .. A concept taken from the Chinese of the convenient style if eating rice in a bowl with curry or meat works well here .. They take delivery orders through Swiggy n Food Panda too which works well if you work around the hi-tech city area .. The Kheema Sambar rice bowl is my favorite .. You gave various others on offer too .. The service is quick which is good cuz sometimes the place gets reallt crowded not forgetting the continuous delivery orders they keep getting. One bowl is enuff to satisfy one person's hunger pangs .. The portions of rice are good however it would be even better if the proportions of meat were better for the meat lovers .. U can pay extra for more meat but not a lot of ppl do that .. As the saying goes .. "" Itne paise mein itna hi milega .. "" ;P oh .. No seating .. It's a food stand so u stand n eat or sit if there is a chair available .. Doesn't really matter cuz most of the crowd that comes here is the work crowd that wants to get back to work on time ..

"1731011","One lazy afternoon I used swiggy to order two rice bowls from this place
Egg roast rice bowl and Mix veg rice bowl. The delivery was on time. Now from the pics I expected a larger bowl. The rice was small compared to the pics given.
The quality of food is above average. Would rate it as 3.5. However one rice bowl per person is not good enough for a person on a weekend afternoon. For the quantity I would rate it as 2.5/5.
Verdict - Good food but less quantity. Order it if you are feeling lazy and want to eat rice and curry.",3,"2016-01-11 19:05:06",30,50,0
