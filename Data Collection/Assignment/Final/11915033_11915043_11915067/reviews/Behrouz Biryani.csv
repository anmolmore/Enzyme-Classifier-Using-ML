"186898","I ordered the biryani with great expectations. The packaging, and the presentation is extremely nice, and the aroma was great. The biryani thigh, was frozen in the middle! It's a prepackaged frozen food reheated at the time of ordering. That is not the expectation, at least in Hyderabad!
The fact that it is not fresh offsets a lot of the positives for me ",2,"2019-05-18 18:01:40",11,117,0

"66509100","One of the worst biriyanis i ate . Home deliverd thru zomato . Very worse . I wud like to cook my self though tired than ordering in behrouse.one of the worst biryani i ever had. One has to pay for packaging only. Big packaging and less quantity. One should never order from Behroz biryani. Do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesNever try biryani here , However we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the Biryani. Not sure how Behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton. We have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant. worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life , and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379¬†
No taste and no quality. I wonder where he brought his chef from to prepare biryani , guess from a local slum area to get this biryani made and serving to innocent public of Hyderabad
Note¬†
increase the quality food then no matter what the price is .",1,"2019-03-24 00:02:00",1,0,0

"65573249","I've order for home delivery. The service was quick and Hassle Free.
Ordered veg biryani from the restaurant as suddenly I was craving for veg. I was so impressed by the packing & also they give raita & gulab jamun with it.
The biryani was properly packed. And was warm enough to eat too. It had a really good taste that other places with veg biryani don't. It's really different. And its very tasty.
One can definitely try their veg biryani.

Do try it out. ",4,"2019-03-12 02:18:56",78,158,1

"36387823","Well this is an absolute honest review from a hardcore Hyderabadi and a true foodie.. I understand a lot of people complain about behrouz biryani but here's my review, behrouz is not a Hyderabadi biryani and is unique in itself and the brand claims it's biryani not being local.
I might not like it to the core as an Hyderabadi but as a food critique I don't have any complaints.. it's unique in it's preparation, was absolutely mild, ordered chicken lazeez biryani which had juicy chicken pieces, the quantity was sufficient for two moderate eaters, was aromatic and we'll garnished with dry fruits.
Felt the flavour was somewhere between a regular biryani and Mandi, now this review even holds strong backing as I had a Irani friend who liked it as well.
Really loved the packaging and the complimentary desert. The gulab jamun definitely killed the joy at the end, did regret eating it..and the mint raitha can definitely do be improved.

The packaging really impressed me, because in case of Biriyani when it is present in a bowl, it is tough to eat it directly from that, but Behrouz serves it in a plate kinda aluminum box, with the necessary cutleries attached, and the flat feature enables the consumer to have each spoon flavourful with no spices left out. Then about the taste of the Biriyani, well it wasn't exactly up to my expectations, as my personal choice of Biriyani is the one with the ittar aroma and spices as well, but this one had spices which tasted sweet. So it was basically a SWEET Biriyani. The chicken pieces were small and many, like big chunks, but were good. Mint raita was also impressive. If you have a sweet tooth in main courses too, then you can go for this Biriyani. I would love to try out other Biriyanis from Behrouz later some time :)",4,"2018-11-04 02:39:15",22,161,0

"53177446","I heard about behrouz biriyani many times from my friends . So finally ordred dum ghost biriyani as I am a mutton lover.
The best thing what I attracted is the packeging and looks. it was came with a box consist of a gluab jamun and flavoured biriyani rice with 4 mid size boneless mutton pieces, fried onions and small almond pieces.
The taste was some thing different. It was not like the others biriyanis what common and normal n taste and easily available everywhere in hyderabad .
I would love to order or visit the place again . Highly recommended for biryani lovers who are looking for some new taste. ",5,"2018-09-08 13:40:56",25,977,0

"16470595","A rich flavoured Bhuna Murg biryani from this place surely will delight ur taste buds. As I opened the box of my Biryani the aroma was so tempting. It tasted yum topped with lots of deep fried onions and almonds. It has more of the Lucknowi Biryani taste. The only reason I don‚Äôt give it a 5 is it is way too rich as a meal.

After 3 hours a guy called me that he is out to deliver the food. Which is hours after I requested zomato customer care and cancelled my order. And it happened second time. Earlier they answered but said it will take one and half hour I waited and not delivered. This is my second bad experience... Very sad about it.",1,"2018-08-27 11:56:21",1,1,0
