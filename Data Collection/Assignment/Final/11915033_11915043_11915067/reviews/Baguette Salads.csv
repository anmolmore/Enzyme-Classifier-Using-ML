"98509687","It's a lovely place to hangout with friends and have fresh food. I ordered text message, tokyo, crazy foods and nuts quantity is decent.
Went to this place afternoon the concept is quite similar to subway but has so many options.
The salads were very fresh. I had some smoothies like cold summer, cool summer.
Honestly I'm neither a salad person nor a fitness freak.

They have mouthwatering salads and smoothies those who are health conscious and fitness freak should visit this place for a fresh and healthy food taste is awesome

Baguette salads @Gachibowli
I went there with couple of my friends to have something healthy & delicious. The ambiance is quite amazing with great lighting and decor.
The staff was very kind and polite and the service was really quick.
We tried there different salads and they have amazing names for it like Tex-Mex, Tokyo, New Orleans, Malibu beach & many more.
Tex-Mex:
It was my favourite of all. This was a mix of Romaine, JalapeÃ±os, cheddar cheese & tortilla chips yes they  add tortilla chips to their salad with Classic Caesar dressing. And this was served in a baguette which is a great idea. They have bowl & pita bread options also.
Tokyo:
This was a mix of shredded carrots, roasted almonds, orange, currants, Arcadian blend & crispy Chinese noodles with vinaigrette dressing. The crispy Chinese noodles and orange were giving great taste to the salad. A must try out salad.
New Orleans:
This was a jumble of red onions, pickles, cheddar cheese, iceberg & tomatoes with French Remoulade. I had in pita bread which tasted great.
Marine:
This was a merge of Arcadian blend, cranberries, beets, cheddar cheese & caramelised pecans with thousands Iceland dressing.
We tried some smoothies too like 
1. The cool summer which was a blend of oranges, cucumber, apples & lemon juice.
2. The cold blaster which was a mix of oranges, mangoes & grapes.
3. First date which was a blend of oranges, apples, dates, pineapples & ginger juice.
All the smoothies were good but could have been better but the salad were really deliciously amazing & healthy.",4,"2019-03-26 14:23:50",81,1139,10
"1738375","So with everyone trying to be more health conscious now, Baguette salads is a great addition to cater to people wanting to eat fresh salads. Visited their recently opened branch at Gachibowli.
To begin with, we ordered the Tex Mex salad chicken (baguette), Tokyo salad veg (bowl) along with a currant affairs smoothie and a cold blaster smoothie.
The Tex Mex salad was made up of pieces of grilled chicken, crispy romaine lettuce, jalapenos, cheddar cheese, nacho chips with a classic caesar dressing. This was a delightful salad, taste was excellent, the chicken was grilled perfectly, lettuce was fresh and crispy, jalapenos added to the flavor, but it was the surprise ingredient - nacho chips which stole the show. Caesar dressing was apt for this salad.
Tokyo salad was a mix of almonds, oranges, black currants, carrots topped with crispy noodles and vinaigrette dressing. This salad had multiple flavours with orange slices, almond's, carrots and the dressing.
Among the smoothies, the currant affairs was better than the cold blaster.
They have a plethora of options for salads on their menu. The veggies they used were fresh and other ingredients were used well.
Will try other items on the list next time. They serve salads in bowls, baguettes and pita pockets depending on your choice. Prices are pocket friendly and portion size is decent. ",4,"2019-03-23 23:23:46",157,492,8
