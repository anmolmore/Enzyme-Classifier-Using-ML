"36263035","To be honest ... this is a roadside eatery and a very popular one too. The seating area pics here in previous review and also the menu are not of jaiBhavani. They are for another one situated above it and have a similar name. Jai Bhavani is pure veg and serves only South Indian food. It run by a group of Marathi people. It being a roadside eatery it is very crowded and it doesn't have a seating area. The food is good and very easy on pockets as well. To have a quick and cheap bite one should come here.",3,"2018-09-11 21:52:39",59,182,2
"14541441","This is just a roadside food stall selling so-called chinese items like fried rice, noodles-all in indian style.
The food is not good and do not expect even a bit of hygiene from this particular place.
This place is not at all recommended if there better options.",2,"2016-08-02 18:04:12",685,792,0
