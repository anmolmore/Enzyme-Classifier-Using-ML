"36263035","A little small shop that sells cold beverages and ice creams. Found the name as misnomer as I was expecting really long list of menu of different types of lassi. But they have only a handful of the same. But one thing that struck me was the pricing. It is quite low and affordable. Also the quantity served is also very decent.
Do not expect much of sitting space or ambience as the name suggests that it is just a shop. Therefore its just over the counter sales. Taste wise it is pretty decent and they do serve in quick time.
There are many outlets of the shop and one should visit any one of these this summer if looking to get some respite from the heat and in low budget",3,"2019-03-10 07:44:39",59,182,0

"33410905","Visited this place though of giving a try as it seemed to be very pocket friendly. Yes! It is pocket friendly, coffee on the rocks/dry fruits shake was ultimately good! And the quantity that we get for the price we pay is worth.",4,"2018-12-03 13:43:48",28,36,1
"37629603","Lassi shop.
It is a small dessert parlour with plenty of options including ice cream, cold coffee, mocktails etc. The prices are extremely humble and pocket friendly. This is definitely a place for students who eat on a budget. This place is usually filled with customers during evenings and nights it will take sometime to get your order. 
Talking about the taste, it’s pretty decent for the price range. Lassi and ice creams over here are absolutely amazing! Try their plain lassi for sure. Milk shakes and smoothies are good too.
I’m telling you again, this place is really pocket friendly that two people can easily eat for around Rs.200.
I recommend this place for grabbing a dessert after a heavy meal or just to hang out with your friends at evenings.",4,"2018-12-02 01:52:24",51,63,1
"44870962","The quality is never consistent. I have ordered Mud coffee and Mississippi mud twice. The quality of both were very good in the first order. So I repeated the same. But this time it was very disappointing. The mud coffee was a little bitter but Okayish. Mississippi mud was nowhere nearer to its actual taste. Zomato should atleast identify repeated orders from customers and make sure that the quality remains unaffected. ",2,"2018-11-22 18:04:44",17,5,2
"37271791","Ordered Coffee on rock. Taste was so yum and upto the mark. The only thing is just reduce the quantity of ice,else it was so yumm and really refreshing.",4,"2018-10-23 21:58:20",33,42,1
"10379811","So we tried Belgian Chip Mocktail here and luckily it turned out to be amazing. You should check out in the pictures attached how amazing it looks. But i would recommend that you go to the place and have this because we had ordered two times the same item and they mixed up things with some other beverage. ",4,"2018-09-30 20:55:40",76,563,1
"32159204","It's quite crowded when compared to Oye Lassi that exists a little distance away. The Mango Lassi that this place serves is absolute bliss. I will not say the same about the Banana and Chocolate combo. Lots of protein filled shakes for health and gym buffs. Doesn't restrict itself to just lassi. Has shakes, mocktails and some really innovative drinks to beat the heat and refresh oneself. Yet to try most of the concoctions on the menu.",4,"2018-08-05 00:58:24",115,546,0
