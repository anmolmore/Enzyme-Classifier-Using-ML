"40984746","The taste and quality of the food here is on a slippery slope. I used to love the Boston creme donut. What once used to have a juicy, creamy filling is now a miser's dab. Burgers have also lost their taste and are mostly insincere. ",2,"2019-05-03 14:25:21",12,2,0
"43366185","I have eaten at this place a couple of times before and the donuts were decent. But today, we picked a few donuts to take home and when we tasted them, they felt so stale and tasteless, as if they have been made at least 3 days ago. This was definitely not expected from them",1,"2019-04-20 22:47:08",4,3,0

I‚Äôm not sure if all these places have the same procedures for hygiene coz I bit into something I did not want at all. The staff did apologise but it wasn‚Äôt a pleasant experience.

"2944162","Dunkin Donuts has always been a great donut place according to me. They serve excellent coffee and burgers as well. I particularly love the Naughty Lucy burger, which is an all time favourite.
This time I decided to try their new Grilled Chicken Monster Burger and I was a little disappointed. As a whole, the burger tasted fine but, why on earth did the chicken burger have a layer of hash browns? Such a bummer. üòê
However, the donut did uplift my mood in the end, brining the final rating to 3.5. Man does that 'Death by Chocolate' slay me everytime (pun intended üòÇ). ",3,"2019-01-25 21:19:43",52,732,2
"38681696","I been to this place on a Saturday morning to have a üç©, I was really disappointed with the service, in the first place the air conditioning was not working, I still compromised to have the donuts, after having the donuts the staff was not able to give me the bill saying that billing machine is not working, I had to pay the parking fee for my car, since I was not having the bill.
I had a bad experience ",1,"2019-01-12 23:31:33",32,3052,1
"16589305","Located in SLN Terminus on the ground floor, this joint has a good seating and decent ambience.
The place is a bad maintained one in terms of staff and food. A donut shop must have sugar glazed donuts at all times, but initially they refused to serve one.
Finally the donut I had was the Caramel Vanilla, the donut was first served cold despite telling them to heat it. The donut anyways turned out to be a good one, perfectly sweet and hot. The caramel however was not upto the mark.
For the drink I had Vanilla Macchiato, the drink was way different from illustration. It lacked the caramel sauce on top and almost had no taste of vanilla, we also ordered for classic macchiato which tasted the same. So there was no vanilla in my coffee.
I would suggest skip this place and head somewhere else for the sweet cravings post dinner.",2,"2019-01-04 11:06:26",57,446,3
"35563742","Loved the ambience of the place. Also we ordered a box of six classics, and all of them were delicious.

"32345901","The donuts were fresh and tasty. However these donuts were little small in size compared to donuts served in other outlets. The ambience was good but needs a little maintenance like the tables were not clean and there were flies around.

"2717132","I just came out of this outlet. The food is as per DD standards but the venue lacked basic hygiene and maintenance.
The tables were not cleaned on time and hence it had flies hovering around it. The wipe used for cleaning the table too was so dirty that it left a stench behind after the table was cleanes.
For payment too when I decided to pay through the mobile wallet, instead of the standard QR code or getting a request for the OTP, I was asked to pay the same to the store managers number as their system wasn't working.",3,"2018-12-25 15:01:44",266,1558,1

"35883491","Though the brand's famous for donuts, I'd have to start the review with their Burger. After having got bored with McD, KFC and other popular burger places, DD's burgers are just stunning. Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.¬† The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!
Coming to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.
And, their packaging is great. I loved the boxes they provided!",5,"2018-11-07 20:52:03",97,174,3

Have been to this place multiple times. This is located at the bottom floor of SLN Terminal Mall. Ordered Heaven Can Wait Chicken burger, Double Big Joy and Big Joy Veg burgers.

"33503433","Landed up here on a Saturday night after shopping a couple of stuff. Following summaries my experience below-:
Ambiance- The ambiance is of a coffee shop and quite a typical one of Dunkin. The walls seemed somewhat empty as compared to the Dunkin outlets I have been to in Pune and Mumbai. Ample seating for say 30 people. 3.5/5
Service- You pay at the counter and he will hear your doughnuts and you take them yourself to your seat. It is an entirely self service type of mode. Nothing extraordinary. 3/5
Food- We tried the following two doughnuts-:
Kit kat doughnut- The doughnut was very fresh but the kit kat taste was okayish, not exactly of it. The chocolate factor was also less. The freshness and the typical dough taste gives this a 4/5.
Mango doughnut- Literally no taste of mango but again the yummy freshness dough taste which won my heart. Just for that 3/5.
Will I come here again? I like just one here which is Ugly Strawberry. Do try that if you like strawberries.",3,"2018-08-22 15:32:53",316,1157,1
"47851579","Had naughty Lucy veg burger meal, alive by chocolate, lychee litchi donuts and filter coffee dunkin style.
The burger was cheesy and tasted good. The donuts were excellent , especially the center lychee filling in the lychee litchi donut. The coffee had a hint of caramel and is worth a try. In all would have rated it at 3.5 as AC was not functional, but will go with 4 for donuts.",4,"2018-08-04 18:40:43",40,78,0

"15682988","Simple and sweet outlet. I liked the episode outlet with some great graffiti. The service counter girl was kind of ride though as we said something for order and she ordered something else and then she argued. Well, for the love of donuts - The chocolate and the mango craze and the rainbow pop were awesome. Soft, spongy and colourful were the words. The taste of Mango craze could be improved more though. The chocolate over the donut was little rough and it meant that way I guess. So, overall great. ",3.5,"2017-08-14 13:23:59",337,831,7
"40082332","I can't say the donuts are too tasty.if you are a sweet lover you can once try this.we ordered a pack of six and I felt no difference in each of these ,in taste they look similar except the yellow one(mango flavoured).
I didn't even feel it as fresh one ,as soon as I ordered he bought the one which he has packed it and kept as stock.overall, I was disappointed for the first time being there.
Once you can try this as a snack, but it's too sweet.
Ambience i can rate as 3.5/5

"672720","Unhelpful and rude staff. According to Zomato, they are supposed to be open till 11 but the staff gives excuses to not accept orders at 10.45 also, probably because they want to leave early. On top of that, they have the audacity to behave rudely. 
Don't visit this outlet.",1,"2017-08-12 23:00:16",6,158,0
"292310","It took me so long to pen down this review, 6 days to be exact! And why you ask. Well that's because I had to taste 6 donuts in all.Yess, I decided to try the festive Rakhi donut box that comes with 6 mini Donuts ranging from death by chocolate, chocolate filled, mango flavored, two classics, etc. All this priced at Rs 199 plus taxes. This roughly came out to Rs 243.
So much goodness in one box!
Now I can't name each of the Donuts but I can say that majority were chocolate based. Of the 6 donuts, 2 were classic style and rest 4 were filled ones.
The first one was the classic sugar coated. Simple and goody good.
The second one was a chocolate coated classic donut. This one was fine.
Next up the mango flavored one. This one had a mango glaze on top and center filled with mango puree or jam. This was a fresh taste after so much chocolate.
The fourth one I think was death by chocolate. This one had a delicious chocolate coating on top and center filled with gooey chocolate.
The fifth one had a chocolate topping but cream filling. This one was ok.
The last one again had a chocolate topping and a vanilla filling. This one was good. The topping had some sprinkles too.
All in all a sinful treat for all donut heads out there.
Definitely a must try.
Breaking away from my usual style of writing I will come to the location and ambience after the food. 
So this outlet is located on the ground floor of SLN terminus. Very easy to locate. The board is visible from the road. 
The interiors like other Dunkin Donuts outlets is quirky with pop colour furniture and interesting wall designs. On a Sunday afternoon the place was moderately crowded. 
Service was good. No issues there. Would love to visit again!",4,"2017-08-12 12:41:19",120,1507,4
"35836801","This has been my favourite donut place here. I tried almost all the flavours n varities they offer in donuts. Last week I tried their burgers both chicken n veg. The veg burger was horribly bad.. the other one was okayish. So I recommend this place only for donuts!",3.5,"2017-08-12 10:46:34",247,316,2
"36898897","It's a new kinda place for new kinda food which is donuts. I liked the donuts but the beverages(hot & cold) are not upto the mark.
Ratings:
Food and quality: 3.5/5 (above average)
Service at the counter: 2.5/5 (below avg)
Ambience & seating: 3/5 (average)
Overall: 3/5
The service is very bad and the reputation of such shops are going down because they're treating all the customers as those low class business meet holding people in Hyderabad. 
However the taste of the beverages is very bad. The below are the beverages we tried.
1. Tough guy cappuccino 
2. Mocha chip
3. Jamaican rum with almonds
P.S: Just try varieties of donuts or burgers. Don't go for beverages.",3,"2017-08-05 13:27:25",50,223,3
