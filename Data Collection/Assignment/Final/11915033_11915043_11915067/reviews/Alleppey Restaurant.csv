"15791416","It's a small place tucked away near the back gate of HCU. It's basically a small Kerala restaurant where you get the regular Kerala fare. Don't expect any ambience or luxury and visit them only for the food on offer. Try out their Porotta, appam and beef fry. Taste is great and pricing is extremely reasonable.
