"15962386","Heard about this new place and decided to ditch home cooking one day to indulge in temptation. I read previous reviews about chole bhature so straight away ordered it - and it was worth it!!! I was lost in the flavours and the thin,not at all oily bhature. And all for only 65₹.
Unfortunately batti chicken was not available so I have another reason to head back to this make shift garden with bean bags, foldable quencha chairs and wooden tables. Very cosy place to hangout with friends, specially during pocket crunch. 
Also I will recommend not to have the milkshakes as it's not upto the mark. I tried black currant milkshake which was very dilute. Parnik Kumar Gaurav ",4.5,"2018-02-28 11:53:09",74,210,3
"1179756","I was in Hyderabad last weekend and my friend suggested me to this nicely decorated, small food restaurant, with one of the cool cozy sitting arrangements. (They have bean bags, how cool is that!)
We had Baati Choka with Chicken, Paneer and Aloo Paratha, and  Chhole Bhature, if you are craving for some mouthwatering and authentic North Indian food, this is the place you should go. Myself being from Lucknow (known for one of the best non veg food across India), the chicken they served took me back to memories of my home town, (One of the best I had in ages) and icing on the cake is the awesome hospitality and quick service, Ambiance is very nice and is near the vicinity of all the Major offices.
Manager is so humble and cool, and they will take suggestions for improvements.  
Taste is awesome and you really don't need to worry about your pocket, as the prices are really reasonable. In a nutshell Great Food, with Low prices, Keep up the Good work Kitchen Garden!!

Kitchen Garden is a pocket friendly place for some one like us and the decorations are sure to uplift your mood, come what may.

"36625314","The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. The team was super hospitable and the decor is really fresh (even took photos so we could try replicate some at home). We tried bunch of varieties from parathas to veg starters to main course and can assure that I experienced such authentic north indian taste after a very long time. I would recommend this place for one and all and would definitely visit quite often. Big kudos to the whole team!!!!",5,"2018-01-23 19:57:04",1,1,0
"31350400","Delicious food, amicable staff and amazing ambience. The owner Sakshi takes good care of customers. I had chilled bhature and cold coffee. Both were great. They also cater to special preparation requests, if you want extra strong, spicy, etc. All in all they totally deserve a 5.0",5,"2018-01-23 19:25:36",7,45,0
"49022371","Lunch(well late lunchs - it opens at 2 PM), snacks or dinner, kitchen garden fills you completely. Authentic north indian kulcha, best paratha, shakes, sandwiches, rolls and what not. Even dosa and idli and some more south Indian dishes. I have personally felt it very rare that a place serving both north indian food and south Indian food of equally good quality. Favorite place in Gachibowli. Well done Kitchen Garden!!",5,"2018-01-23 08:53:04",1,3,0
"2851952","What more can a north indian living in Hyderabad relish more than authentic north indian food? Kitchen Garden keeps it simple and that is their USP. Menu is short and sweet but enough to provide a hearty meal. Tried their Chola Bhatura and Aloo Kulcha with Dal Makhni and Shakes. Contentment beyond words...",4.5,"2018-01-23 01:30:38",1,76,0
