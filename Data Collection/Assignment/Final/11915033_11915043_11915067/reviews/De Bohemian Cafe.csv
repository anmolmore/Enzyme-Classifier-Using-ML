This new tiny little place with a quirky vibe to it...
The food served was fresh and delicious.
The sandwiches were perfectly grilled ... Not too grilled and hard nor too little to be soft ... It had the perfect crisp to the breadüçû and the filling was flavorful and fresh.. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken sausage sandwich both of them were a delight to eat...
After a long draining day at work if tea‚òï is what you go back for then definitely grab a cup of this refreshing sulaimani tea which is basically an elaichi flavored black tea... It is has a frangrant and refreshing flavor which could just fix anything üòá...

Food is made with so much love here and you can make it out.
üè†Ambience is good and they have made an effort to turn this space into as boho as they can. Perfect Adda for college students or for others who want to have some lipsmacking food.
ü•™ Sandwiches were Divine! Where can you experience divinity for forty bucksü§©? Bread slices are grilled gently as not to hurt them much and this kept the bread fresh and moist.
Grilled Egg Sandwich had a perfectly cooked plain omelette inside topped with fresh and raw veggies making every bite very delightful.
Grilled Paneer Sandwich had overflowing amounts of paneer and sauce. Soft Bread slices with soft,mushy and creamy paneer inside was really a treat to have. Oh! They have taken care of your dietary fibre intake also by adding lots of spinach to it.
üçπLemon and mint juice was a great refresher with exact amount of sugar and mint leaves.
This place has an elaborate menu ranging from rolls to faludas at pocket friendly prices. Service was prompt and you will be informed of your wait time if there is any delay.
HCU's back gate is slowly becoming an hub for affordable, tasty and quality food.",4,"2019-03-19 23:15:42",81,869,1
