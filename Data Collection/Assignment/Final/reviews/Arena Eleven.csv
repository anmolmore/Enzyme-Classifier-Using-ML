"221486","I ordered Chicken Hakka, they gave us Chicken Chowmein absolutely white, blant and tasteless. I complained to the waiter who said thats the way they make it, yet he offered to replace with Chicken Schezwan noodles which I declined, as I wasn't sure to further ruin my taste n appetite. Cocktails were decent, non-veg platter was ok ok, couldn't differentiate between the taste in tikkas.  I am grading down to 2 stars only because of the amateur Chowmein served in the name of Hakka.

"10446851","Yesterday we went to this place.
Service is very very slow even on a weekday. It took so much time for kababs to come.
Often they say, if you arrive late, make it grand. We hoped the food will be awesome as they might took so much time to prepare it. But alas! the food is disgusting!
Not recommended at all. Go only if you're getting offer like more than 60% off.. Otherwise complete waste of money!",1,"2019-05-07 18:07:38",1,0,0
"1982842","Today went to this place. I will be brutality true.. There's a reason why they are giving huge discounts via different booking/table reservation platforms.
Service : very very slow even on a weekday. Seems kitchen is highly understaffed.
Food: Pathetic! I am living in Hyderabad for last 10 years. I haven't had so pathetic kababs here in Hyderabad, like what I got at arena eleven.
Overall a BIG NO. Please don't waste your money here.
1. Ordered fish lemon pepper kabab.. It was too salty.
2. Ordered chicken tikka kabab. You can't even chew the chickn pieces, it was so hard & tasteless.
3. Ordered a mocktail for my wife, it was full of water instead!! ",1,"2019-05-06 23:53:31",37,27,2

"32316668","Arena eleven sports bar
IPl is here and whats better way to enjoy it than watching it in a sports bar! There aren't many sports bar around and Arena Eleven is the swankiest ones in town. Located in the SNL terminal , this is the best destination if you are a sports fan.
AMBIENCE (4/5): The seating space is quite big with multiple screens with sports channels playing on every wall and corner. They have a nice wooden furniture which also adds to the asthetics of the place. Beautifully designed restro, Arena Eleven has all glass walls and is perfect to have a city view while munching on your food. They have some good tracks playing which I liked as well.They have indoor as well as outdoor seating.Outdoor seating us just opposite to landscape of trees and was bliss to enjoy it as the rain drops poured down the city.
FOOD AND BEVERAGES ( 4/5) :
You can opt for either ala carte or buffet.The place has both options.
Mocktails and cocktails : In mocktails we had non alcoholic sangria which was the best drink amonst all we tried. This had grape juice , with fresh apple and bartenders mix. Then we tried Mint Julep which was fresh otange wedges with mint,lime and orange juice. It was decent.Zen Zero was the one we tried next which had lemon chunks ,brown sugar ,ginger and fresh mint topped with cola. It was nothing special and was too sweet.Virgin mojito was as it should be.
In cocktails we tried Old Fashioned which had bourbon with sugar and bitters. This one was a little too concentrated and strong for me.next we had Kentucky apple cinnamon which had burbon whiskey infused with apple juice and Cinnamon. It was a delightfull drink.Then was the cucumber cooler which had gin infused with cucumber and sour mix. This drink did not appeal to my taste as was too much of cucumber taste.
Food:
1. Veg manchaow soup : The soup did not appeal my pallate . It was moreovee tasting like rasam than a Chinese soup.
2. Tandoor items : we had some tandoori chicken legs and some chicken tikkas which were really well prepared and chicken quality was also good.
3. Tandoori non veg sizzler : This was a surprise which sizzling mixed tendoori items like chicken tikka , fish tikka .it was absolutely delighfull.
4.Tandoori veg sizzler : This had paneer tikka,veg seekh kabab.the veg seekh kabab was dry and lacked in flavour.
5. Hot wings : The hot wings were sweet to taste where as ,as the name itself suggests it should be hot and spicy. This was a disappointing one
6.Tandoori chicken tandri : Tandoori chicken tandri was tender and juicy and masalas were nicely amalgamated with the chicken peices.
7. Masala Fries : This is a very new concept which I tried for the first time. The masala fries were served with chopped onions.It was really good and we couldn't stop at one or two.
8.Chilli fish : chilli fish was a nicely tossed fish in oriental style.
8. Chicken Tikka Pizza : chicken tikka pizza was absolutely scrumptious toppings. This was a thin crust pizza with indianised way of toppings and pizza sauce. The crust though was too hard and felt as if not freshly baked.
9. Chicken seekh kabab : I absolutely loved the seekh kababs which had a nice flavours of soices coming through.
10. Veg seekh kabab : the veg seekh kqbabs felt dry and lacked flavours.could be better.
11. Chicken green curry and steamed rice : the chicken green curry was absolutely divine to eyes. The consistency was also creamy. The taste though was slightly to the sweeter side which dint give the balanced flavour.
12. Chicken tikka biryani ( from the buffet) : absolutely yummy this biryani was the one eveeyone has there eyes on from the veey beginning. The hot steaming biryani was spicy and the lipsmacking tikkas along gave a nice taste overall.
DESSERTS
1. Gajar ka halwa : I absolutely loved the gajar ka halwa. Warm halwa just melted in the mouth and with the icecream along ,it felt divine.
2. Kheer : the kheer was also nice and gave a cery homely taste.
The place is really nominal with good food. With this rate charged and the sports add on it provides,this place is absolutely recommended.",4,"2019-05-01 21:54:46",43,132,10
"52485847","Arena Eleven - A Sports bar which is located at Kondapur at Level 3 in SLN terminus has got varieites of Kebabs and buffet system.

"35623254","Yesterday,I went with my friend to arena eleven. Best thing was ambience and atmosphere. Service was damn slow. Even bill takes half an hour. We have ordered Pizza and Manchurian. Waiter forget our Manchurian. But taste was good. Overall, Food was good. We ordered 1 pint of beer and 3 30mL whiskey. Sadly, IPL match washed out. Food and drinks are quite reasonable price. All this cost 942 after dineout offer. My overall experience was good. Hope to experience better service next time.",4,"2019-05-01 10:48:24",6,20,0
"50029279","Was here few days back. The place was so busy and full. Had to wait a few minutes to get a table.
Staff were friendly and patient, got a table we requested.
Coming to the food ordered Chicken Nasheman Tikka, Stuffed Tangdi Kebab and Fish Tikka for starters. All tasted good. Tried Pina Colada Mocktail which was fine but don't go with spicy food.For Maindish we were suggested to take Sizzling Chicken Tikka Biryani and was tatsy as suggested.
Ambaince was good with outdoor and indoor seating.
P.S. They may take quite a time for the dishes but don't get frustrated just sit back and enjoy the IPL screening on all the walls. Good thing is that you don't have to turn your head.",4,"2019-05-01 09:29:59",64,100,5
"3134148","Arena Eleven, an sports bar with the theme menu of kebabs and beer with live screening of sports every day. Located in the sln terminus mall in level 3, cozy ambience well set up of giant screens and LED screens all over the restaurant as you cannot miss any single action of your sorts while eating the delicious kebabs and sizzlers. A pocket friendly restaurant with awesome food menu.
I have been there on multiple times once with a friend and also by a invite. Both of my experiences are much better then the before one.
My favorites at Arena eleven are the kebab sizzling platters, the assorted sizzling platters are so succulent and tasty with the hot sizzle.
I Love the chicken pizza the thin crust and the toppings are really good.
Thai Green Curry with steam rice are one of my favorite, but just they need to be little consistent.
Chicken tikka biryani is the USP of arena eleven menu, it's really too good in taste and the quality.
I had the best non alcoholic Sangria here. It was the best so far, must try this.
Arena eleven has very good and economical lunch buffet, the spread is much worth at price of Rs: 550/-
Rice kheer is my favorite in desserts. ",5,"2019-04-30 23:46:04",251,2182,10
"52137531","Visited Arena 11 for a Sunday Branch. It was Easter Sunday and the place was packed. Also, since the IPL season is on, this sports themed restaurant was on our visit list.
The have Sunday Buffet Brunch and the menu is very compact but most of the items in buffet were delicious. Though the presentation can be improved alot.
We also tasted their ala carte menu, a few of the items were good but their isn't much consistency with their dishes.
At once it will be amazing but the other time it can be below par.
Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka, Honey Chilli Chicken Wings and Tangri Kebab were served.
The Lemon Fish Tikka and Tangdi Kebab were good but Honey Chilli Chicken Wings were too sweet for my palate.
The Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries were good.
In buffet, the Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani stood out.
Also gajar ka halwa in desserts was great.
I suggest them to add some more variety for desserts",3,"2019-04-30 20:26:04",84,368,0
"38325717","Arena Eleven is a sports bar ,located at the plush and financial province of Hitec city .There is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. The menu is extensive. There is plenty of waitstaff. Our waitress frequently stopped by to make sure we were satisfied, and refilled soda and water drinks without being requested to.
We say outside seating gives you are brief view of the surrounding areas and the view is simply beautiful playing. The music selections were good, but not too loud.
The portions were very generous. .
There are many TV screens for sports viewing indoor, and even a few outdoor.
An overall good atmosphere..They have a buffet and alacarte kind of system here ..upon ourvisit here we tried their buffet and ordered few delicacies from their Alacarte menu as well ..the food the drinks everything was on point .one can surely enjoy this place at any time of the day .as this place is a sports bar as such the reservation is recommended during any sport featurings .do head to this place if you are a sports buff and if yournt one as you will have a great time at this place

But after taking money they didn't provide a table. My team stood there for almost 50mins. Later we were forced to walk out. They did refund the money bt had to go through alot before getting it back. Guys there are lot of good places for watching IPL. This is a shit place...u will end up destroying ur day.

"573349","It's during this time of the year where the cricket fanactics are on a lookout for places offering sports screenings and feel almost heartbroken not to find any dedicated sports bar in town. But not to worry as Arena Eleven's here to woo the same crowd, with their delightful sports-themed decor offering big-screen match telecasts for sports and all that coming with a beautiful rooftop ambience. Located at Level 4 of SLN Terminus Mall in Gachibowli, the tagline for the place is ""Kebabs, Beers & Sports"" each of which is incorporated in the menu as well as the setting quite aptly.
The menu for the place is particularly compact, serving only a selective few Indian and Oriental preparations both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diets. Sampling their vegetarian appetizer from the a'la carte section, we ended up calling for their Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries both of which turned out to be pretty good. The platter came with 3 different tikkas of our choice, namely Veg Shami, Peri Peri and Lemon Pepper Paneer Tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onions on the base. Veg Shami was something that was absolutely mindblowing with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture. Masala Fries was just a Indianized version of loaded fries with the crisp potatoes sauted in with onions, ginger and garlic which worked as a good accompaniment for the drinks.
Non vegetarian section had some really nice dishes including the Tangri Kebab, Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka and Honey Chili Chicken Wings which were just perfect for a setting of this kind. My personal favourite was their Lemon Pepper Fish however, for the juicy and succulent fish chunks giving that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination. Honey Chili Wings too were pretty good as a finger food having crispy fried wings tossed in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce, probably the best candidate to be had along with a couple of chilled beers. Disappointing was their Chili Fish however which had no flavour whatsoever - bland pieces of fish with the coating sauce containing just chili without any seasoning. The kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in seasoning the fried fish with some salt and pepper.
Running a buffet on weekends, the place offers a beautiful selection of mains to the diners having a variety of Indian options to choose from. Each of the diets had two curries on offer with a choice of breads and rice, where the non vegetarian sect had Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani along with some delectable Chicken Tikka Biryani. After the disappointment in the starters, it almost came as a surprise how good both the mains were. Chicken Curry had the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bites added, going absolutely well with some hot Tandoori Rotis. Same was the case with Murg Makhani as well however it had a bit too much of sweetness for my taste. Trying out their Chicken Tikka Pizza from the a'la carte section turned out to be a disaster as the puffy base seemed to be store bought and stale, which definitely didn't justify the price tag for the same. The dessert options too gave little to choose from where we went for the Gajar ka Halwa and Rice Kheer both of which were plain simple average.
The service too wasn't any exemplary as the staff almost at all times paid no heed to the diners calling them out for help. Getting even a glass of water turned out to be a huge task, however on multiple complaints the restaurant manager did mend things well. The kitchen deserves appreciation for sending out dishes fast into the dining room however in the pace, they almost always lacked consistency. The dishes we ordered at the start of the meal when again called, brought something entirely different and dreadful on a plate. All in all, if the place provides a run-of-the-mill menu with a some good dishes but lacking the consistency to deliver entirely.instagram.com",3,"2019-04-25 10:44:06",241,3414,15
"50113671","Arena Eleven, nestled in SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, is a sports-themed bar and restaurant with live screenings all around. With two large screens and three televisions, no matter where your table is, you will be able to catch all the sporting action. During the day, the clarity of the large screens is lower, because of the bright light from the glass panes. The best part of the outdoor seating section is that it is located just beside the botanical garden with a sumptuous view of the green cover. Perfect to enjoy the cool breeze, watch a match and hang out with friends.¬†The bar menu offers an extensive range of classic cocktails with a good variety of imported spirits and liqueur. They serve a widespread buffet with an array of mains. The starters will be served to the table.
In the starters, we tried the  Sizzling tikka platter which consists of Chicken Tandoori, lemon pepper Chicken, Tangdi Chicken,  Paneer Tikka, Veg Seekh Kabab and Fish tikka.  Tangdi Chicken made a perfect starter, soft and succulent chicken legs coated with a host of spices and grilled to perfection. Fish Tikka was melting in the mouth with good flavors.  In veg, don't miss out in Paneer Tikka. It was so soft and properly cooked with the right amount of spices infused. Veg Seekh Kebab was good when we had it for the first time. But when ordered for the next time, it was very dry.
Apart from the Tikka platter, we tried Chicken 65, Honey chili wings, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish and Masala Fries. I loved all of them.
In the main course, from the buffet, they have two non-veg curries and two veg curries and assorted bread. Curries tasted delightful with rich gravy and spices on point. Ordered and tried their Thai Veg curry, which disappointed me, as it was too sweet. Chicken Tikka Biryani is a hit, It was as tasty as it looks. It was very different from the regular Hyderabadi Biryani yet very delicious.¬†
Tried the Butter Chicken Masala Pizza. Though the toppings were great, the pre-baked base which they used dropped the taste.
From desserts, they have Gajar Halwa and Rice Kheer. Tasted Ok-ish , not so great.
Drinks need some improvements, as some are very sweet.
If improved on the glitches in the food and drinks, its a great place to Eat, drink, socialize and watch your favourite sports live.",4,"2019-04-24 13:15:13",76,180,27

Replacing Serafina, Arena Eleven is a new addition to the SLN Terminus mall. With TV screens playing different kinds of sports and walls adorned with sports memorabilia, the place is a crowd-puller during this IPL season. The place is well lit and has a long deck that gives you a beautiful view of the botanical garden.
Our Sunday lunch started with a few drinks. Mint Julep, Virgin Mojito, Virgin Sangria, Virgin Pina Colada, Zen Zero - a mojito like drink with cola, Calvados - their version of a hot toddy, Old fashioned and Kentucky Apple Cinnamon. Though the cocktails were potent, they lacked finesse. Mocktails in most cases were either too sweet or watered down. The better ones of the lot were Calvados, Apple Cinnamon and Mint Julep.
In the starters, we tried their sizzling tikka platter that had an assortment of regular chicken, lemon pepper, malai, nasheman, paneer and fish tikkas. The stand out ones here were the fish and lemon pepper tikkas. We also tried their Tangdi kebab, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish, salt and pepper wings, chicken 65, honey chili wings, chicken lollipop in hot garlic sauce, masala fries, chicken and veg sheek kebabs. One thing we noticed in these starters was the lack of consistency. Our first round of the veg sheek kebab was amazing which led us to order more. The second round was super disappointing as the kebab was dry and tasteless. The tangdi kebab was well made. Soft and juicy chicken marinated well and cooked to perfection in a tandoor. The chili fish and fish tikka too were super delicious!
I visited this place twice. During the first visit, I tried the Chicken peri peri tikka roll, Chicken Rajiala, Onion Kulcha and Thai Green Chicken curry for mains. The roll was passable. We were told that the chicken rajiala was a star on their menu but it didn't really prove to be. It tasted like a regular buffet green chicken curry. Nothing special. The thai green chicken curry blew us off with it's flavors. Each of the flavors in the dish could be tasted individually but when they came together, it was magic! Pairing it with some hot steamed rice elevated it further and left of licking our spoons! During the second visit, we chose to eat the mains from their Sunday buffet and it was not a great decision. Except a few dishes like the chicken curry and chicken tikka biryani, the rest were tasteless. We also ordered a chicken butter masala pizza that had a pre-made base and tasted substandard. We ordered a portion of the green curry again which utterly disappointed us by being too sweet.
They only had a couple of desserts in both instances - Gajar Halwa and Rice Kheer. They were just run-of-the-mill kind and didn't have any oomph factor.
Overall, one thing that the place needs is consistency. Their tag reads Kebabs. Beer. Sports but the kebabs part isn't really justified. Service is decent. They need quite a few improvements to keep up with the pace. They have some really pocket friendly happy hours and the place is awesome during sunset!

"1700577","Arena Eleven is a relatively new addition to the concept of sports bar in the city. Located inside the SLN terminus, it attracts a relatively young crowd living in the nearby IT hubs.
I went over there to try out their Weekend Buffet. First things first, their Buffet layout was well spread. The starters were served on the table accompanied by an array of curries and rice dishes to choose from. The drinks offered by them included Mojito, Zen Zero and Mint Julep. The drinks were average and needs quite improvement.
Speaking about their starters, I had their Chicken Tangdi, Malai Paneer tikka, Salt and Pepper prawns, Lemon pepper Chicken tikka, Mutton Seekh kebab and Veg Seekh kebab.
Amongst all the starters, I loved their Chicken tangdi kebab. The chicken was super juicy and was cooked to perfection. The use of proper marination was quite evident in the taste of the meat. Next up, I also liked their Lemon pepper Chicken tikka. It had a subtle flavor of lemon all thanks to the dominating flavor of the pepper.
For mains, the spread comprised of two chicken main course dishes, two veg main course dishes accompanied by Dal, Assorted breads, Biryani and Salads. The chicken dishes were Chicken curry and Chicken tikka masala. I found both the curries simply wonderful just because of the fact that they were tasting much like home cooked chicken. For veg, their was Mutter Paneer and Paneer butter masala. I liked their Mutter Paneer as it was really balanced in terms of flavor.
Their Biryani was a slight disappointment for me. It could have been much more flavorful and the use of boneless chicken didn't really serve justice to the dish. Apart from this, I also had my hands on their Veg thai curry. It was served with steamed rice. To be honest, the preparation of Thai Green Curry was too good but the only thing which upset me was that it was sweeter than the normal version. Maybe, they can work upon the use of Cocunut cream in the curry.
For desserts, I had their Gajar ka Halwa, Kheer and Ice cream. The desserts were pretty much ordinary and needs ample improvement all together.
All in all, the place has got a huge potential. All they need to do is to work upon slight glitches in their drinks and few main course items. Happy eating. :)",4,"2019-04-22 12:21:48",275,1978,8
"29180789","It looks like a sports bar with proper setup. But the people around did not seem to be sportive, especially on a Friday night :P. Service was a bit on the slower side. Ambiance was good. Now coming to the main part, the food.
Sizzling non-veg Tikka Platter with 3 tikkas of your choice.
Jamaica Chicken Tikka - the best of the lot and a must try.
Nasheman Chicken Tikka - not so appealing but ok ok types taste.
Malai fish tikka - soft and tasty
Bhuna Chicken - one of the best I have ever had especially the fried onions on the top makes it so delicious, so this is a must try
Chicken Rajiala - A green gravy with boneless chicken, not so tasty
Chicken Hakka Noodles - It was too good especially for Chinese lovers
Sizzling Chicken Tikka Biryani - look wise it was actually sizzling, but not so much taste wise. Chicken pieces were a bit hard and rice undercooked.
Ginger Coke - Please do not try this one, as it was too costly and not at all a worthy drink
Overall was a good experience.",3,"2019-04-20 12:50:18",30,112,3

"2372532","They‚Äôve opened up recently and I think they have a long way to reach good management. 
Other than beer, I‚Äôve tried their LIT and a classic martini! 
They‚Äôve got quite a nice ambience for a sports bar. 
Food was delicious. 
I‚Äôve tried their sizzling non veg tikka platter where you get to choose 3 varieties from their whole kebabs menu!
As per the guy who served us, Jamaican and Nasheman was their speciality.
So we ordered that platter with Jamaican, Nasheman and Malai fish tikka.
Jamaican: 4/5 (more of a spicy tandoor)
Nasheman:3/5 (lame and tasteless)
Malai Fish:4/5 (loves the soft malai fish)
The only problem I faced was table management. 
Each time I had to order, I literally had to shout and wave my hands multiple times to get someone‚Äôs attention to my table.

I enjoyed that moment with drizzle and my drink.
I tried some fish item, I forget the name of the dish ..its finger licking dish. And tangidi biryani was taste less, no salt, no masala, may cheif might forgotten to add all these.

We were 14 members altogether. We were served welcome drinks and followed by starters. Which was nicely cooked. Then we approached towards main course. Although I didn't try much because I was already full with starters. I tried their desert which was nice. Overall a nice place for dining out. But I think this place should be visited at night while watching football match or some IPL match with beers and kebabs. Great place to hangout.",4,"2019-04-04 10:31:11",75,464,0

"914654","I visited this place with my wife on 16 March,2019.¬† Its located in SLN terminus. We were looking for a place to dine after our movie at Platinum, and we decided to give this place a try. Was it worth it, lets find out.
Ambiance
============
We entered this place around 10 pm on a Saturday night and this place was¬† literally bustling with crowd. They have several television screens set up at various nook and corners of the lounge, and all of them played sports channel, ranging from Cricket to Premier League Football. We were promptly seated at the Verandah. The view from there is quite something. We got seated in a semi lit corner. The place has a cozy feeling and good vibes. Liked it. Ratings - 4/5.
Service
============
Pathetic. Needs a lot of improvement. They took some time to produce the Menu, and then the waiter just didn't show up for the order, for next 15 minutes at-least. We ordered food and drinks. The food was delayed and drinks just did't come. We had to repeatedly ask the waiter to serve the drinks at-least, so that we can end our boredom. Luckily the food came soon after the drinks were served. When asked for the bill, they showed a mobile shot of the bill amount taken by the cashier, saying printer was faulty. Phew! Ratings - 1/5.
Food
============
Did food proved to be the Savior for the night? Read on.¬† We ordered a cranberry breezer, virgin mojito and couple of Pinacoladas(Yes, we took advantage of Gold membership). The virgin mojito was pathetic. Period.¬† The Pinacoladas were really good. We ordered for Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter, which was strictly okay.¬† Well the service and food really disappointed. Ratings - 3/5.
Value for Money
=============
We shelled out 1200 bucks for food and drinks, that too have taken the gold membership advantage. High pricing along with lousy service and strictly average food never go hand in hand. So no way its VFM. Ratings - 1.5/5.
Let's calculate,
Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 2.375
Final Thoughts
=============
This place has all the potential to be nice a sports bar, and I feel that their service and food really needs improvement!",2,"2019-03-23 18:07:01",31,69,2
"37381843","Experience at Arena Eleven... Since it‚Äôs in SLN Terminus mall it‚Äôs not very difficult to find. It was a Friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn‚Äôt the best, although it could be! Place was packed by 9-9:30 pm. Definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better. One big minus point is that on a Friday evening the washroom was out of order and I had to cross all SLN third floor to get to the toilet. Ups, that‚Äôs really bad!
Ambiance is vibrant, atmosphere is good but the music is too loud! Usually I don‚Äôt mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation. They have screens and it‚Äôs a good place to watch some sports. There is some kind of terrace too and that‚Äôs good till the hot summer.
Service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen. They also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren‚Äôt available (like burgers, pizza, etc). On a Friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered!
When it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average. We had sizzling kebab platter. Chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose. Awesome kebabs!! Really juicy and tasty every each one of them. We had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious. They didn‚Äôt give any mirch ka salaan, raitha or onion with the biryani, just plain but I asked for some raitha and they brought. Rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces. The let down were the rolls. We had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges. Maximum average on quality and taste.
The price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try, at least for the kebabs!

Service guys are not bothered to ask if customer needs anything even if restaurant was not full. one of my ordered food was not even provided and what was provided that was stale and when asked manager was very rude with his replies. I left the restaurant in the middle as except bira beer everything was pathetic even in last Management guy declined to provide me the bill and was VERY VERY rude, waited for around 15 minutes after paying the amount just to get the bill.

"39524626","Went for lunch buffet.
Ambience was good with very nice choice of music. Night view would be very nice.
Choice of starters was limited but the taste was good. Chicken kebab with a tinge of lemon was the best. However fish was undercooked.
Surprisingly main course was quiet tasty with chicken tikka masala being the best.
On the dessert side, kheer was a spot on.
At the end i would like to tell the worst part of my experience which was the service. An utter dissapointment.
The waiter's arguing behaviour and careless service ruined my mood. I would ask the owner to please teach some basic behaviour to this waiter. I dont know his name but i think he is just ruining his fellowmates career as well.

Chose this over some top restaurants at SLN Terminus and I must say I wasn't disappointed.
The buffet has a simple menu with nearly 20 items. Food tasted decent but the desserts should be improved by miles as they create final impressions in any buffet.
Ambiance is quite good with Indoor and Outdoor seating, the place was fully packed on a Weekday afternoon.
