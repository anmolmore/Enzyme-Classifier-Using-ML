"35211884","Green bawarchi is a most familiar restaurant in Hyderabad. They spread over Hyderabad. You will find any green bawarchi near your area.
Coming to this like all green bawarchi restaurants, they have crowd for taken away customers. We had take many times.
Coming to dine here. It's like any normal restaurant with basic interiors. We have to wait 25-30mins after order something. We had grilled chicken, butter chicken, butter naan, rumali roti and chicken biryani. I like their chutney which comes with chicken. Biryani was nice but little spicy. Roti and butter naan both were fine.
Pocket friendly. We can go with family and friends.

"48353445","This is the first place I experienced Hyderabadi Biryani. I walked in and ordered a chicken briyani. No big deal. The cost was nearly the same as in Chennai, about 200 bucks (I don't remember exactly, but it was around 200). I was shocked when the waiter came with a big serving of briyani. How big, you ask? Two people could share it easily. The taste was first class. I for one can handle briyani as much as you think, but I was stunned. It isn't the best briyani I've ever tasted, but its my first Hyderabadi Biryani and I loved it. Such a great experience.",5,"2018-12-09 20:31:17",11,7,1
