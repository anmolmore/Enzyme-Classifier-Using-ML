"33503433","This place has such awesome ratings that I actually fear that it was just a bad experience for me that day. Rather a bad day for them. I ordered from here. Following summarizes my experience-:
Packaging/Presentation- Well packed in a typical paper bag which are the usual ones for every Wok based Restaurant. Nothing bad in the packing. 4/5
Service- The guy was polite but I found the service slow. 3/5
Food- Now, this is the major disastrous part. I tried the following-:
I asked for a non spicy Wok Your way and I was advised to try the Kapitan Sauce dressing by the attendant.¬†
Wok Your way in Kapitan Sauce- It was so bad that I felt like vomiting in the very first bite. The coconut flavour has to be dealt with correctly but the taste was bad. I ate it remembering the price I had paid. #DoNotOrder. Mine was Brown Rice+Mushrooms with other veggies. Tasted horrible and its taste actually haunts me. 1/5
Will I order from here again? Looking at the ratings I feel my choice of selection has gone wrong and I am tempted to try this place again to give it another chance.",1,"2019-05-07 16:20:49",316,1157,2

"14812991","I went to WOK Republic for my weekend rituals.
The place isn't too big, but the staff is very courteous over there.
We ordered Chicken Momos and Chicken Wings. They served them with a red chilli sauce, I really don't know what it's ingredients were, but it tasted amazing.
Good place for some quick bites. ",4,"2019-03-18 15:33:23",168,425,2

"35865851","One of my favourite places to have some Thai cuisine . The very limited menu was available. The staff wanted us to try the wings and panko prawns after that we ordered the non veg box . The wok got all the tastes in it worth place to try",4,"2019-03-09 20:54:57",67,2375,7
"42915938","I got a home delivery done and ordered a chicken box with extra chicken but i hardly got any chicken in the box, taste and quality is average.",3,"2019-02-19 22:36:27",1,1,0
"134537","I normally don't do this as my expectation from food is basic. Today, I ordered food from Wok Republic.
2 Tom yum chicken soups
1 non veg American chopsuey
1 veg pad thai noodles
The Tom yum soups were excessively salty, so I couldn't finish it. Chicken was acceptable.
Veg pad thai noodles were so oily that it felt bad in taste.
American chopsuey was okay. Just okay.
So overall it wasn't worth the 700 rupees I spent on the dinner. I don't know, maybe it was an odd bad day for the kitchen but this experience was enough for me to never order from Wok Republic again or try it for any meals.",1,"2018-12-16 22:28:37",3,1,0

"35422959","It is a place with decent ambbience. Their concept of giving food in boxes is something that they have adopted from the western culture and is the differentiating factor in a place like Hyderabad. Food taste can be better.",4,"2018-12-04 08:22:35",91,126,0

"4996111","This is go-to place for Chinese. I have ordered twice from here and both were amazing experiences.
The Great ball of China is their version of an amazing non-gravy veg manchurian. It was fab, spicy but not way too hot.
Nanchunks and Samurai Sticks were also very tasty. A dip with Samurai Sticks would have been better. But without that also, it was pretty much complete.

"3099955","Have been hearing a lot of positive reviews and ordered this on Uber eats as I was craving for chinese.
Ordered chicken and veg noodles in chilli plum sauce, sounds of drum, wok your way box ( chicken fried Rice, manchurian sauce with broccoli) and Thai papaya salad.
The package was really good, however I felt that the box was really small considering the price, however as soon as we start eating, we get to know the quantity is not bad!
The sounds of drum were fabulous. The pieces were very juicy and the flavor was amazing!
When it comes to noodles, I found the taste to be really good, however I felt that the flavor was very overpowering and a person cannot eat it completely if he is not a big fan of sauces. However the taste was very good.
Wok your way was a surprise. The quantity of the fried rice and manchurian gravy was a lot considering the price ( 235 bucks) and the taste was again fabulous.
The papaya salad was pretty good, however it did not taste like papaya at all.
Overall this is a highly recommended place if you are craving for some yummy Chinese food! ",4,"2018-06-08 03:33:35",126,798,4
