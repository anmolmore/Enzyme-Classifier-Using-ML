"33905377","I ordered cheese paratha and aloo paratha and the packing is very similar to another paratha serving establishment but thats where the similarities stop.¬†The parathas are big but the filling almost feels non existent. I dont know if its the parathas i was delivered or if thats how they usually make it. Either way the paratha has neglible filling and that coupled with lack of salt in the paratha dough makes it almost inedible. The amount of mint chutney and the yogurt is half the cup they send in. You might as well send me smaller cups instead of the current half filled cup coz thats off putting.¬†Either way there is a lot you guys have to work on. I am not giving it a 1 just because of a benefit of doubt that it might be a one off thing.",2,"2018-07-18 22:41:51",97,97,0

"32331267","best ever thing that zomato did this year is 50% off üòç
I generally do not order online but had to order lunch few times and this offer is just wow. i saw this option listed on top for online delivery and I ordered mix veg paratha.
the order came on time and was hot. it was nicely packed with paratha (2 pieces) and curd, pickle, green chutney and butter in different boxes. the paratha was yummy and good to taste. the quantity was fulfilling for one person.it would have costed me around 170 which is a little expensive for 2 paratha while I got it at 100 (thanks to zomato offer)
definitely a recommendation but not on month ends üòÇ DesiFry ",4,"2018-04-11 00:21:44",174,1283,2
