"2717132","I haven't tried the sweets here, so my review is restricted to the savouries and chaat that I ordered from here.
The place is lit up pretty well outside and does attract attention, but it's not very tidy inside. They've kept the chairs like they keep in waiting lounges, so it's kind of inconvenient in case you like to share your chat.
I had samosa chaat and it was pretty decent. Not too great but not bad either. For 50 + GST I found it to be a little on the expensive side, esp when they add only one samosa to the entire chat. The savouries are limited in option but taste well. Murukku is best amongst the lot that I took home. The other stuff i.e Namakpara and Kodballe was also decent.",4,"2018-12-09 11:11:04",266,1558,0

"48088574","They have a dry and hard sweet made up of kaju and jaggery. Don't remember the exact name but it's very good. Snacks are good as well.
Would need bit of improvement in the presentability.
Prices are a bit below than pulla reddy. ",3,"2018-10-13 11:27:06",30,14,0

"1616867","I had been in the year 2014 when Gachibowli was not much improved. Those days Bicha Reddy Sweets used to be not soo good. And yesterday, as Sweet Magic did not have rasmalai, i had to forcefully buy it from Bicha Reddy. The taste of the sweet was like blunt and rasmalai was bad. Spoiled my stomach.",2,"2018-09-17 02:36:19",18,43,0
"31703712","The chaats here are a must try. Sweets are a good accompaniment too.
The place could be a little clutter free though. It is great for a quick takeout. ",5,"2018-08-30 19:59:26",10,79,0

"40068065","Bicha Reddy (Gachibowli) is such an awesome place to binge on Pani Puri. My husband and I go so often to have it as an evening snack. They serve with hot channa ragda and spicy tangy water. This place is predominantly a sweet shop, but most likely pani puri is relished here than any other items.",4,"2017-11-21 11:22:30",3,5,0

"1711191","An okayish sweetshop.
You'll enjoy the south indian sweets here... but north indian sweets were a disappointment. 
I liked the packaging though, if you are gifting to someone.",3,"2016-07-15 16:40:36",186,124,0
"3208820","I went to this shop with my friend to try out there sweets but surprisingly the chat section was very much crowded rather then trying the sweets we have tried there chat items first, we have ordered for a bhel puri, samosa ragada and pani puri. I really like the taste of there bhel puri tangy and a little bit spicy a perfect combination, whereas my friend loved there samosa ragada , the pani puri was good too.
After having some lip smacking chat, it was time to try some of there sweets but they don't offer a lot of varieties in sweets so we just had jilebis and gulab jamun it was ok, but the chat items definitely steal the show must try.",3.5,"2016-01-12 14:46:42",27,381,0

"545853","This is a very old sweet shop of gachibowli...located on the main road before gachibowli flyover.pretty gud parking space.
It's a very old sweet shop n they don't update much.
Their jilebis,kalakan is really gud to try.
Coming to the best part which is chaat.
Pav bhaji,vada pav,pani puri,ragada r d best .
They maintain the quality n use mineral water for pani puri .
Pocket friendly place too ",4,"2015-08-10 18:10:40",328,1432,17
