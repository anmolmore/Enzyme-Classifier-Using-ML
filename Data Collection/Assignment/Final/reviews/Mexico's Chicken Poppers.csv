the Bbq Chicken Burritos had a bread which i could describe as a chapati that decided to become a kobus half way, filled with crispy chicken, lettuce, Bbq sauce and rice... while i thought the flavor added by the rice was interesting in a good way, it may not be appealing to many...
The Creamy Fries were good... comes with fries, few wedges and topped with mild mayo and bbq sauce...
Overall the food does have a more sweet flavor with no spice to complement it...
Comes in nice packaging and quick delivery...
