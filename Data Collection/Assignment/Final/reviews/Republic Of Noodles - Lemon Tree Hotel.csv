"44677130","I went to this place on a Sunday evening. First the ambience of this place is excellent and the vibes you get , quickly puts you in a very relaxing mood.
The music there is very transcendental.
Food : we ordered phad thai noodles and a skewed pork belly. The noodles were soft ,sweet ,tangy and the vegetables added the savory to it. The nuts added the crispy element to it.
The skewed pork belly was soft and full of flavors .
Service: Excellent! Period.

"38735711","We had been to this place few years back and were delighted with the experience.  Hence revisited on a weekend in May 2019 hoping for the same.  Unfortunately the quality seems to have significantly deteriorated.  A starter of fried chicken was borderline inedible.  Extremely hard and salty.  Grilled mushroom starter was salty, again.  A fish started which came wrapped leaf,  looked enticing but clearly the quality and tenderness of fish was not up to the mark.  Noodles and rice were good for main course and so was ice cream browny for dessert.  ",3,"2019-05-11 23:56:06",56,534,5
"35057829","The hospitality of this place goes way above your expectation. We were also staying at this hotel when we decided to check out this restaurant.
We ordered beef tenderloin and char kway teow.
They were cooked perfectly and had the authentic oriental flavour.
I would surely recommend this place for its hospitality, the serene ambience and food obviously. :)",5,"2019-05-11 23:03:58",4,1,3
"502322","This place never fails to impress us. Tried a variety of options from the menu. Every dish is beautifully presented and deliciousüòã. For our fourth visit today in starters we tried Chicken Satay with peanut sauce, the sauce was incredible, finger lickin‚Äô. Main course was MHAD Noodles, again delicious. And of course no meal is complete without dessert- Fried Icecream. Tried it in NY for the first time and the only place that can compete with it is here at RONüòä. Also the staff Sita was courteous and kept checking on us to ensure we enjoyed our mealüôÇ and had a lovely evening overall.",5,"2019-05-06 00:19:44",11,12,2

They serve a good hearty bowl of Colour, texture, nutrition and above all the amazing and well balanced flavours of coconut, Kaffir lime, spice with complimentary Jasmine sticky rice. This time I also tried Green Thai Curry and again it was so well balanced with nice green colour. But any time Srilankan Curry tops my list.
Must try for Asian food!",5,"2018-12-20 14:05:22",8,25,0

"31804575","We were a group of 3 friends who went to this place.
Ambience: Pleasant and comfortable. Nothing extraordinary but pleasant.
Food: We ordered grilled mushrooms for starters which were good. Fish starters and soup was also very good as told by my friends (since i am a vegetarian).
For main course we had a light coconuty based curry, japanese rice and crispy fried and normal Thai noodles. The main course was absolutely delicious. My friend Nikita Dhawan called it comfort food. We ordered white wine to go along with the food.
Service: The service was on time and our servers Apurv and Sita were extremely polite and responsive.
Overall a good place to go for some Pan Asian food.",5,"2018-12-08 07:25:04",7,14,0

"15037671","Went for a drink and some starters.... thoroughly disappointed. Firstly they said they couldn't serve Long island ice tea coz they ran out of tequila and on the other hand they were suggesting an in house martini special which is made with tequila....not sure what was happening. Quality of food for the price paid was sub-par. Sorry but not coming back.",2,"2018-12-01 23:52:18",4,66,0

"158963","Keeping up the legacy of Republic of Noodles at Hitech City, this is as amazing place to have a nice asian meal.
Ambiance: The place is quite open but the decor is very different from its cousin at Hitech city. One side of it is completely glass with a nice view and the place is lime coloured. In the centre of the restaurant on the wall, we have a big decoration piece and the walls are adorned with framed pictures. All in all a nice and cozy place which is very welcoming.
Food: For context, we were blown with the food @ Republic of Noodles in Hitech City.  So this time we wanted to try out something new, and ordered the Roast Pork followed by the Sri Lankan curry with chicken. The pork was a stir fry with sticky gravy and was delicious. The Sri Lankan gravy on the other hand was just divine. The coconut taste with the moist chicken and jasmine rice was to die for. We really enjoyed the mea and @Zomato Gold again gave us amazing savings!
Service: We had an excellent experience a part of which was definitely the great service. Our waiter was very attentive and helped us out with the order. He also made the Sri Lankan curry in chicken which is originally with fish on the menu. Very good service.",5,"2018-10-11 15:32:54",366,3961,6

"35694979","This place serves amazing Chinese food. We tried most of their signature dishes and we were pretty delighted. The ambience is also very soothing. The pick of the spread was srilankan fish curry which was cooked in coconut based gravy and thai rice served with customised tossings. The grilled mushroom stick and the Tom Yung soup were also nice, though a bit spicy.",4,"2018-09-04 23:06:07",113,1194,8
"1272449","Was suggested this restaurant by a friend. He said, ""This is the best Asian Cuisine Restaurant you will find in entire Hyderabad"". I am not sure if it is the best, but I can definitely say that it is fantastic.
The ambience is so calming and serene. The aroma, light music, dim lights it makes this place a perfect place for your date.
The food may take a little longer to be served, but that's because they're preparing it fresh and with lots of love. A must go place if you like Asian cuisine",5,"2018-09-01 15:14:11",129,584,0

"399898","If one is looking for fine dine authentic Chinese ,then this restaurant is surely a must to hit .NOt all restuarant in Hyderabad serve authentic Chinese .
I being a Chinese cuisine enthusiast ,hit this place after i found Zomato gold offer available here . The place is compact but it does is decently lit and adorned with modern interior - perfect to match its Chinese theme .
I started with popiah Jay veg sprig rolls(3.5/5) & chilly apricot glazed babycorn(2.5/5) . The former were usual soft spring rolls filled with appropriately cooked thin noodles ,cabbage ,onion and carrot which was served with chilly ,sweet chilly ,mustard sauces .
The later dish was well cooked ,one might find oil oozing out of the fried wedges and the the taste of marinated sauce would get subsided in mouth due to excessive oil.
In maincourse i ordered mhad noodles cooking with chilly and corriender veg (4.5/5)which was medium spicy .the veggies were well cooked and it was topped with fried noodles . To accompany noodles I ordered seasonal vegetables with garlic and basil gravy(4/5) - medium spicy ,well cooked veggies like water chest nuts,carrot ,pok choy ,capsicum .overall a decent dish !
Special mention for the team who took our complain seriously and offered a complementry dish .",4,"2018-08-23 01:29:50",138,817,7
"6420551","The place is well-suited for a perfect romantic dinner but not a family dineout or a friend's hangout. The desserts menu needs to be expanded quite a bit and include more non-egg based items too. We were a group of 11 and were impressed by the speed of service. We tried cheese cake and frozen ice-cream for desserts but didn't quite relish it. Overall an average experience. ",3,"2018-08-09 09:48:47",21,56,0
"35561291","For me, predictability and consistency are very important in case of a restaurant; and Republic of Noodles has never failed me on that.

"894969","We decided to vusit Republic of Noodles at last moment on Saturday evening. This was bookmarked for long time based on the ratings. The restaurant has good southeast Asian decor and place was quite and relaxing.
We ordered cabbage n tomato soup, vegetables spring rolls and banana leaf fish. Soup was hot and tasty. Spring rolls were very well cooked n fish tasty too, though slightly Spicey. Souces on the table are must try. We ordered Burmese noodles in main course . Noodles were creamy n rich and well cooked. Again must try. Finally we opted for fried ice cream which wasn't so good with covering being little chewy.
Overall the restaurant is good in terms of decor, service and good. You can visit with friends or families for a quite and relaxing dinner.",4,"2018-06-17 12:28:40",209,4085,7

"2670178","Good place for oriental cuisine in the ""Tech"" part of hyderabad. Really loved the ambience mainly due to decorations which gives you a feel of being in an east asian country. Food was good but could have been better. Lemon tart was not as good as I expected. Staff was friendly and taught me how to use chopsticks. They were asking for feedback in between which gave a sense that they are taking their job seriously.

I told them this and they apologized and took the plates back.. When they came back with the so called correction, it was just warm not sizzling hot. The food is certainly overpriced. My son wanted to eat french fries in starters which costed us 350 rps!!!!!!! And as i mentioned above even the french fries were just warm not adequately hot. The shrimp had a strong smell which i can tell is not fresh and above that cold! Taste was good. But there are better places than this so would never want to waste my money on this kind of food.

Ordered a litchi flavoured one and it was mind boggling-ly good, can't recall having such good ice cream in years. Worth visiting this place just for the ice-cream.

RON has always been my favourite when I crave for some Asian food. Visited this place twice in span of 2 days ( different branches) and both of them ensured I dint leave the place disappointed. Their BASA fish wrapped in banana leaf is one of the best dishes you can order here - however u wouldn't get that after spice taste that I generally enjoy in China Bistro. This one has more flavor of lemon grass in it. Their Yam dip is to die for - it can turn any dish tasty and spicy.
Thai Garlic butterfly Prawns (flat Prawns) was the first time I tried and turned out to be scrumptious.
Waterchestnuts were equally delicious and goon in portion size. 
Lamb Rendang Curry is my usual fav here but this time it had a different taste which dint go very well.
MHAD noodles (both Veg and chicken versions) are their signature dishes and is one dish I can complete all alone üòÉ. A combination of Crispy and soft noodles is something you shouldn't miss ordering when you are here!",4.5,"2017-10-24 19:11:34",309,1998,9

Their tom kha gai and javanese soto ayam seafood soups are just awesome. In starters the banana leaf wrapped fish is absolutely melt in your mouth. For vegetarians the water chestnut and bamboo shoot are quite good. Coming to the main course Thai chilli basil noodles and Indonesian spice rice with sri lankan fish curry was perfect. The curry has a little sweet taste because of the coconut milk in it.
Desserts were also quite good. I really liked the cheesecake. It was not too sweet which was the best part. Also the chocolate steamed pudding was good.

Clearly the one in GB beats the one other when it comes to taste of food. Both are equally wonderful but a few things here and there takes this one a step ahead. The crispy water chestnuts and BLW Chicken was just amazing and MHAD noodles were made to perfection by Chefs. All the chefs out there, Chef Raju, Yogesh and swapanjit made sure of it that the food was served hot and finger licking (we did use spoons BTW). Equally supported by the service team, wonderfully lead by Neeraj and helped by Sita and Omkar. Jagabandhu the bartender made wonderfull drinks and allowed us to play pool for a while.

"1712595","The Nizam of noodles it should be called. Republic of Noodles is easily the swankiest restaurant in Hyderabad for feasting on some classic Asian cuisine. I had the green prawn curry with jasmine rice and it was all worth the hype. To top it up I called for the fried ice cream with MHAD noodles, it's a dessert that makes you crawl. Once we were done, the chef personally came over to take our feedback and told us the prep time that goes into perfecting each dish on the menu. I think visiting the republic of noodles should be made a democratic right. Go! ",5,"2016-05-22 16:19:46",7,551,0
"1472097","So I stayed in Hyderabad for a year and there were very few places that truly served good non Telengana/Andhra food and still managed to retain a flair in ther service.¬†
Unfortunately in the land of Nizams good service is hard to come by.¬†
The decor is simple, not over the top. None of that over emphasis on black and red as you see in most Oriental restaurants.¬†
We tried the:¬†
Javanese Soto Aym: ¬†I was really bored of the regular soups that you see adorning every menu in Oriental restaurants, this came as a breath of fresh air.
The soup consisted of a coconut milk flavoured broth. Very flavourful, comes with some tomatoes and glass noodles. It is like the lighter, tastier cousin of the Khao Suey. ¬†
The Grilled Beef Tenderloin Starter: ¬†It came with some lemongrass and pepper dressing. The meat was very tender and the sweetness and spiciness of the sauce really made it memorable.¬†
Lamb with young peppercorns and greens: The cook on the lamb was really good. I don't usually like the flavour of lamb in Hyderabad because the meat predominantly used everywhere is sheep and not goat. This was the real deal.¬†
Prawn Fried Rice: The rice and prawns were soft, not overcooked (Thank God), seasoned well. ¬†
And lastly I must mention, the manager of the restaurant, Akshay, the tall chap. He was very helpful and guided us perfectly through the menu. 5/5 for the service. Hands down the best service in Hyderabad.",5,"2016-05-22 16:09:10",27,325,0

Republic of Noodles was known to me from the Lemon Tree in Goa, but never got to dine there. But I made sure that I didn't leave Hyderabad without giving it a shot. 
The tom yum goong was fabulous. Followed by the Grilled beef tenderloin in black pepper and lemon grass dressing. We Bombay-walas miss our beef sometimes so I was probably food high after I was through with that.  
The massaman was beautifully done with some Fried rice. We ended on a high note, with date pancakes and ice cream.

"1139162","In the arid facade of financial district where good food is a scarcity, RON stands out among the few as a reasonably good offering for pan asian delicacies. RON in Gachibowli doesn't seem to attract as much of a crowd as its¬†fortunate branch in Hitech and it seems to mainly run on corporate lunches and the occasional hunches. We were a group of 7 who wandered into Lemontree and were a mix of veg and non veg eaters.
For starters we ordered the Grilled fish in banana leaf, thai grilled chicken, chilly apricot baby corn. The grilled fish was chewy and a major let down. The babycorn was ok however the grilled chicken was really good. The marinade tasted of a heap of garlic, lemongrass, black peppercorns, and coriander roots.
For main course we ordered MHAD noodles, prawn green curry, massaman veg curry, eggplant in chilli tamarind sauce and steamed jasmine rice. The combination of the sticky jasmine rice and the green curry is something that i still remiss. The smell of the  kaffir lime and the hint of the coconut milk was perfectly mixed with the prawns. I am not entirely sure what the MHAD in the MHAD noodles stands for however it was prepared to perfection and had the right blend of pan fried and deep fried noodles. The eggplant in tamarind sauce has a very strong and overpowering taste and was a turn off. The rest of the items seemed to fall off my palate without bothering my tastebuds.
The ambience of the place is minimal with a good feel of a pan asian restaurant. The music seemed sad and repetitive and largely has a dull feeling to it. The staff is well trained and is very knowledgeable about pan asian cuisines
Not everyone in our group enjoyed the food and despite its name, the Republic of Noodles doesn't seem like a place that has been voted into supremacy by a fan following.",3.5,"2016-05-13 22:14:59",88,692,6

The service was amazing: prompt, courteous and willingness to digress from the menu, customize to the diner's palate. Cocktails were just right and the food as usual nothing short of what we have grown to expect from RoN. We had a crispy lamb dish as starter followed by phad thai noodles with prawns and a burmese chicken curry with lime and potatoes along with some jasmine rice for main course.

-this place is located a bit too far, we wanted to avoid weekday traffic around madhapur so went to this place and ofcourse zomato showed better rating.

We were served with kimchi - vinegar flavored carrots and cucumber to much on till the food was served. 
The beef rendang curry was outstanding along with the sticky jasmine rice. The beef was surprisingly tender and the gravy was spot on with the flavors. One spoon of the rice and gravy and it was a burst of flavors in your mouth! 
The Burmese noodles were average as they were slightly salty and burnt in parts. A total let down after the rendang curry.

"1903260","This is the second time I've eaten here, and I think I prefer this time. I should preface my review by mentioning that the sole reasons we chose to come here was for the pork spare ribs and the lemon tart. I have no doubts that the other items on the menu are excellent, but... Spare ribs. And lemon tarts. Why go for anything lesser?
This time, we ordered the pork spare ribs glazed with honey and chili pork to eat. The chili pork was good, but not particularly amazing. ¬†The pork spare ribs, as I've mentioned, were. A little drier than the last time I ordered them, but still, absolutely delicious. The honey glaze might make them a bit sweet for your taste, so be sure to be clear about what you're looking for.
As for the dessert... A lemon tart, as I very subtly mentioned earlier. It was warm and delicious, so we inhaled it. Then ordered another, with extra cream. It was warmer with an even better crust, so we inhaled that too. We'd have ordered another, but our funds ran out.
All in all, Republic of Noodles is a fantastic restaurant with excellent ambiance, helpful staff, and excellent pork spare ribs and lemon tarts. If I ever end up ordering anything other than those there, I'm sure those will be good too. But why would I?
The only things that could improve the experience would be to put in more chairs near the windows, especially for smaller tables.",4.5,"2016-02-16 20:53:08",169,841,0
