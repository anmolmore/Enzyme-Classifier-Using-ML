"58658494","Quantity is very less. For 2 idlis they have more Sambar, instead they can make one more idly or atleast big one. Food rate is not deserved to be high for less quantity.
Please improve that.",2,"2019-03-03 08:44:57",2,1,0

"1095112","Ordered parotta from uber eats today. Parotta was not fresh and the soya chunk curry provided had a weird smell.
Had to throw the food away. Never gonna try from this place again",1,"2019-01-10 00:14:33",27,4,0
"2977466","I've been wanting to try some TN style parottas here in Gachibowli and found out about this restaurant nearby DLF.¬† It is somewhat a smaller place with not much of an ambiance. You go in there for quick bite of munchy South Indian tiffin items like Idly, Dosa and vada.¬†
I ordered for the parotta kuruma and I have to say, coming from Chennai, the parotta could have been a lot better. It was okayish and I felt it was reheated and not made fresh. The kuruma too was somewhat bland in taste and could have been better.
Will be staying here in Hyderabad for some more weeks and will probably try out their other dishes when I feel a need to have something TN style.",3,"2018-11-15 22:41:12",119,469,1
