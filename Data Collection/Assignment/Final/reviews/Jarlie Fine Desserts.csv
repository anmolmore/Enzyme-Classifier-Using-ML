"20156512","Just wow! This was the best Red Velvet cake I've ever had!
Unlike other bakery, it's most of the cake inside. Though the quantity is a bit less if coming to the price point. But hey! You get to keep the jar too.
You should taste this cake at least once! Delicious!
Deducted 1 star üåü for less quantity at this price. ",4,"2019-02-16 21:25:46",4,0,1
"1296747","The desserts are good. Having tried almost all the varieties liked the blueberry cheesecake and red velvet cake the most. The rainbow cake was overly sweet. ",4,"2019-02-09 18:02:22",119,597,1
"15560412","Sweet tooth cravings on the go ordered the combo of red velvet and triple chocolate .. both of them tasted very good, the composition of cake and cream was apt. 
This is a real dessertgasm, I‚Äôm definitely going to try other desserts too. 
Keep up the good work!! ",5,"2019-02-03 17:09:31",32,123,1
"38771632","Absolutely bizzare restaurant. Doesn't even know the word customer service. Ordered a combo. Asked to change a single item as there wasn't an option in the Zomato. Same price. Same item. Different flavour. And their response was ""Its not a dream you are living. Bullshit. Talk to the manager(who wasn't even there)"" ",1,"2018-12-27 09:21:47",1,5,0

We ordered food through swiggy and had an awesome time.

"37392610","I ordered the Blueberry Cheesecake and was satisfied with the taste and delivery of the item. I would say it was at par with the Cheesecake from Little Things. ",4,"2018-10-08 13:51:22",22,476,0
"2571704","Cookies and cream mousse: Comes in a little, cozy jar with hazelnuts on top. The mousse to cake ratio is perfect. Just the right quantity too.",5,"2018-10-06 17:39:15",124,370,1
"44237244","Update : Updating review after trying triple chocolate with whipped granche. Definitely it changed my mind. It's just super tasty the freshness the softness the super dark chocolate it's just awesome.
Don't know what's the fuss is all about. Was high on expectations after hearing a lots of good words from friends. It can easily be found in all supermarkets e.g ratnadeep and all. I for one did not like the red velvet cheese cake I bought for 110 rs. I have an inner thing for soft n frosty cheesecakes but I didn't find its frosting to be that cheesy or soft. May be because it's a stored product rather than the fresh ones I used have. Overall serviceable for one time tasting and if cheesecake is not readily available near-by.

"8169781","This is a great dessert. I ordered for home delivery. The mango and blue berry cheese cakes were very good. The jars are also nice and can be used for storing spice in the kitchen. I would have preferred a slightly bigger jar. This jar is about 3 inch dia. I think they do have a 150 g offering. One point less for the slight difference in taste when you have fresh cheesecake from a shop.",4,"2018-08-18 13:19:46",61,1188,0
"3100791","This is the first dessert outlet I enjoyed desserts from, during my visit to Hyderabad. 
My friend had stocked up: blueberry cheesecake, mango cheesecake, red velvet cream cheese pastry, and a rainbow pastry. 
The best of the lot was blueberry and next best was red velvet. 
The blueberry dessert had a hint of ginger which gave it an interesting twist. The base of the pastry was crumbly and crunchy, just how one would love it to be. The cream cheese was amazingly fresh and very well flavoured. The blueberry sauce topping was just enough to bring out the perfect amount of sweet without overdoing it. Total win! 
Mango cheesecake was nothing great. I think it was less rich than the blueberry version and also a bit dry. I didn't like the mango and cream cheese combination. 
Red velvet pastry was nice, soft and again fresh. I love that the sugar was balanced in all the desserts unlike many I have in Ahmedabad! 
Rainbow pastry was the least good of the lot. It was sprinkled with coloured sugar balls. That made it overly sweet, and turned me off. It looked pretty though. 
So the must try ones are blueberry and red velvet!!

"33918301","Happiness is having a brother like Ajay Kumar Jammigumpula¬†who brings heaven all the way from Hyderabad in a jar. The Red Velvet jar was an absolute delicacy.

"16470595","Jarlie is one dessert place in Hyderabad. Such heavenly red velvet cake Jarlie makes. Though this wasn‚Äôt one of my favourite flavours. But now I love it. The frosting was like melt in the mouth feel. Looking forward to try their other jars too. I love the yum dessert in cute jars. Really impressive.",5,"2018-07-12 23:28:06",39,150,1

"16142730","Ordered two Jars on a fine Sunday evening. Red velvet cheese cake and triple chocolate one.
Taste - 5/5
Rated it as a 4 because it's a little expensive.
The delivery was quick, I got two beautiful cake jars in a nice cloth bag. The red velvet one actually dissolved in my mouth and was the right amount of sweet. Same about the chocolate one.
It's a must try when you're craving for a sugar rush!! ",4,"2018-07-08 23:33:44",166,977,0

Jarlie is my new addiction 
Best place to order high quality desserts . Jarlie provides yummy ready to eat desserts in a very cute and attractive glass container which will just make your day special üòÄ
Triple chocolate cake is my all time favourite  , but any flavour they offer will never let you down. ",5,"2018-04-11 15:04:38",29,5869,3

"458778","This was my first experience with this new desert place. I ordered after seeing nice reviews and they didn't let me down. Red velvet cake was nice and cream cheese frosting was too good. But you can feel the cake a bit dry as it is supposed to be stored for 15 days as per shelf life of the product mentioned. They serve it in a small cute glass jar. But yes according to the price quantity is a bit less. ",4,"2018-04-08 14:14:39",82,460,3

"32303631","I ordered cheese cake with blue berry topping from other delivery partner. I didn't have higher expectations and I was doubting on packaging and taste. the item arrived in a small glass jar, which was so pretty. The the quantity was so little that it got finished in just 3 big table spoons. If I talk about the taste, it was so so yummy and wanted to have one more. After long time I enjoyed real cheese cake flavor. Will order agian ‚ò∫Ô∏è",4,"2018-04-06 12:45:27",28,59,1
"33901255","I had wayyyy too high expectations from this place as it had been recommended by many of my friends. I won't claim that I was disappointed but it was kindof just okayish.
As per the recommendations, I went for the obvious Triple Chocolate Cake with Whipped Ganache. The topping alone was just heavenly but I can't say the same for the cake which was little soggy.
With 50% Zomato discount on deliveries, this costed me mere 75bucks and hence no complains from my end. Otherwise i feel this place overall is a little overpriced.
Nevertheless, it is worth giving a shot. üòä",4,"2018-04-03 00:01:48",155,1799,1
