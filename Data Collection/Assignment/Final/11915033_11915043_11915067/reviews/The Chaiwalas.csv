"31268787","Call it kulhar or shikora, the absolute bliss in drinking tea is out of one of these! Barely any tea stall keeps these anymore, and no wonder do they make the tea taste better.. Cost ten bucks which is absolutely fine considering the effort which goes into making one. The tea is highly spiced which sometimes becomes a necessity for any tea addict :D Shivanggi Singgh ",4,"2015-11-19 19:40:25",26,98,0
"1530980","Masala chai is the best one here. The place needs an option to sit and enjoy the tea and some shade. The Tea in clay pot option is really nice and unique. Enjoyed it.",3.5,"2015-09-22 18:47:25",28,169,0
"27591421","Good place for masala chai ! They have many types of chai but the chai walas special tea is the best ! The pakodas are a little too oily but compensates with really good chicken paratas !! ",2.5,"2015-06-29 11:35:35",16,11,0
