"2562074","We were there to celebrate our anniversary. There was a set menu, Welcome Drink(very refreshing) tomato Shorba(passable),crispy paneer, chicken tikka (both were very yummy) , butter chicken, paneer butter masala( both passable) , daal fry (yummy) roti (soft) and steamed rice.The pasta in white sauce was good.. But the absolute let down was the pan seared fish with tomatoes. The fish was not done properly, no crispy skin and was a bit smelly. There was ice-cream too.. The service was amazing and so was the ambiance. ",3,"2019-05-06 11:02:50",66,192,0

"33767564","I was excited about the team lunch at Hyatt, however, it turned out to be a disaster!
1. Food variety: Very less compared to any star rated hotels in similar bracket. We were offered only 2 types of Veg and Non veg starters and without even mentioning the dish name. No mutton items what so ever, neither in starters, nor in main course.
2.  The service was poor and slow. I am not sure whether that is for quantity of staff or the quality of staff.
None of the staff was nice or responsive in a way that makes you feel good.
3. The quality of food changed with subsequent refill.  Even the ice creams were too sweet.",1,"2019-04-22 10:59:05",2,25,0
"31302305","Went for team lunch. Have been here in the past too but experience this time was not at all good. Food was not good especially the ones that were refilled. It appeared as if chef changed in between. Breads were too dense, desserts too sweet, chicken overcooked. Most disappointing was the service which is not at all expected from a brand like hyatt. Very slow service with a I don't care attitude. Had to wait very long for some of the requests. The only good thing was probably the decor. And no one will come back only for that.

"31009676","I have been here for breakfast. Its a huge spread as other 5 star properties usually have, but I saw a great variety and different kind of a menu here. For me, a waffle cart was the best part. I just loved the hot and crispy waffles with maple syrup, nutella and berries compost. Do ask for a chef's special. The breakfast option with the stay is a must pick and do try as much as possible from the spread.
A few other things which I liked were the baked potatoes. Just loved them.
Another good thing about them was that they did not cut the fruits beforehand. You had to select your choice and they were cut right in front of you. In the juices section, I could remember a carrot 🥕 ginger, tulsi, aloevera and many such. Detox water was another addition. Apart from these, you could chose the fruits and veggies you wanted and they would make a fresh juice right in front of you.

"883344","Ambience: Peaceful place to hangout with a small group especially during late nights
Service: after two visits, I can say the service is consistent just like any other top hotels in the same league.
Food: Yes, I must say the burger is mediocre. I went for the tenderloin burger cooked medium. This patty has some herbs mixed in it, so if you like some rosemary and thyme in your patty, try it out.
For 850 rupees including taxes, I can say it’s on par with other offerings in the city with a different twist to their burger. 3.5 stars for their burger.",3,"2019-04-11 13:06:08",9,6,1
"849785","I don't expect how people are maintaining the place. 
The service here was such pathetic I think Irani cafes on the roads have better service and delivery time of the service. 
Keeping the service aside the food is decent and the ambience and the pricing is decent but service is one of the worst I can expect from a star rated hotel.
If someone from the management is reading it kindly improve your service if you think there is a need.",2,"2019-04-04 22:37:57",1031,1653,0

Experience: Very Bad!!!
Food: Not Great but few dishes are good..!
Service: Worst..!!!
Management: Rude..!!!
Billing: Brunch Prices not mentioned anywhere but only on Zomato, but they say that price is wrong. Asked the Manager (Mr Maneesh Singh and Prakash) to show the original prices on any Menu or Booklet or Hyatt Website..! They replied with bullshit answers..!
Only thing we liked is the place and ambience..!!
I recommend not to prefer this place with family..!!
This management has shown us how a famous brand like Hyatt can also be the worst experience..!!!",1,"2019-03-10 21:42:34",1,27,0

The managers are the worst in Collage restaurant, very unmannered and impolite. Many of the dishes nameplates are mismatched. The brunch prices don’t match the Zomato prices.",1,"2019-03-10 17:52:07",1,22,0

"16041171","Visited this restaurant thinking to have good food, but the efforts were wasted. We went on a Friday and we started eating the starters. After starters when we asked for main course, the staff told that on Friday they have only street food and no main course is available. Felt like we wasted our money. 
Though the starters were good, but main course should also be there. Street food should be the add on and not the only food. 
Two stars only for the ambience.shubhamtraveltales.wordpress.com",2,"2019-03-03 21:12:04",27,34,9
"100597","I've had the breakfast buffet here quite a number of times and it is really a very good spread they have here.
They have 3 main live counters - one which makes fresh Dosas and Parathas, second makes the waffles and pancakes and the third makes all the egg varieties.
They also have a huge counter for fruits, juices and herbal shots.
Then there is the Indian food counter which has multiple varieties like - chicken curry or Keema curry with Pav, Idli and Wada with Sambhar and 3 types of chutney, Poha or something similar, and few more items.
There is also a counter which serves noodles, sauteed veggies, steamed fish or chicken and Chicken sausages, congee and Miso soup.
Then there is counter with cheeses, cold cuts, pre-made salad, some sweet jars, etc.
Then there's obviously the cereal counter and the breads counter which has amazing Danish bakery items, bread pudding and other baked breads.
That's a huge list!
To top it all, the staff is really courteous and polite and the outside seating is simply serene.",5,"2019-02-27 20:25:59",22,13,0
"1414072","Honestly I would not recommend this place to any of my friends or colleagues. I had dropped by with my colleagues for lunch (buffet) and we really had high expectations and were hoping for good food. Unfortunately all the starters were cold and were not even edible :(!! The biryani
The taste was not even close to the expectations. A big NO NO to food lovers.
The only good thing here was the jazzy decor and desserts. It was a very poor experience overall. ",2,"2019-02-26 15:16:47",60,224,0
"61555409","I went to Hyatt on Valentine's eve around 12am. This place is quiet and comfy but infested with mosquitoes (last thing that u will expect from Hyatt). We ordered North Indian food which was quite yummy but the service was painfully slow. When u enter Hyatt, u don't expect this kind of treatment. Unfortunately, my date was ruined.
Will recommend others not to visit this place just because of Hyatt tag",1,"2019-02-16 00:17:23",3,0,0
"36487248","Visited the place at Midnight 
The best thing is it has constant menu for all 24hours unlike most of the late night restaurants

Ordered Pastas which were awesome although we got it 40min after ordering which needs to be taken care of

"37054570","I would have rated a big 0 or -1 here if I can. its team lunch outing with 40 members. I'm reviewing this keeping in mind that we paid 1500 per person
Food : 
there is no welcome drink. Even an ordinary restaurant offers at least a grape juice. 
Starters : cold, not fresh, tasteless and very hard to eat. VEG: potato, Baby corn. Non-Veg : chicken, Fish
not even a smell of Prawns or mutton in any corner out of whole menu.
main course : only 2 biryanis (veg n chicken). and just a paneer curry and chicken curry with some fancy namedesserts : 
ice creams only strawberry n chocolate flavors which are semi solid n turns to liquid by the team you eat it.
no fruits other than papaya n water melon is very disappointing from a 5 star hotel
Ambience : only tables and chairs are provided. no clothes or spoons or tissues on the table. just like a road side dhaba.
Service : too slow and no up to the expectations",1,"2019-02-05 16:35:07",6,10,0
"93762334","The Lunch served at Collage was way below our expectations.  Cold and lousy tasting food - only 2 varieties of items in the main course.  The soup served was cold.  They had only 2 main course items in veg and non-veg.  Not many varieties of Starters (only 2 Veg starters).  Desserts were minimum.   Ice cream varieties were only 2 (strawberry and chocolate flavors) When we asked for spoons for desserts, the waiters were looking at each other as if they don't know where the spoons are.  Service was poor.",1,"2019-02-05 16:15:51",1,1,0
"558281","Amid the busy lanes of financial district, lies this serene place with lots of greenery and makes one feel pleasant on the outset. A little ahead when you walk through the lobby, lies this very spacious restaurant. Very well managed place I must say. Spacious, well lit with the usage of a lot of natural lighting. The AC temperature was a tad bit on the higher side which was informed to one the the staff but didn't find much difference even after informing.
Service was slow and a little out of place. We asked if they could get milkshakes as we had kids with us. The lady who went to check this has never returned or answered the query. Next, we found the glasses a little smelly which we asked to be replaced. But was never done. The rotis took a lot of time to come. Clearing the used plates took way too long despite informing multiple times. Asked for shawarmas and some food from the live counters which never happened or only a part of it was served. Requested for the dessert section to be extended a little further but again, took away without informing.
Coming to the food, there's loads of choice. Except for a few items on the menu, nothing is worth a Hyatt standard. Loved the ariselu live counter. Shawarmas tasted bland and could not take more than one bite. Mutton curry was too oily and no meat in it. It was filled with bones. Also liked the varieties of rice available.
Overall, a place that could be so much more than what it currently is. If only this was better managed, it has the potential to be the best. ",2,"2019-02-05 14:42:03",204,926,34
"29542135","My worst dinner experience ever.. The buffet’s spread is the smallest you will find any where.. only 2 starters. Biriyani was horrible. Steamed rice was half cooked.

I ordered murg malai tikka, tariwala chicken both werent very much tasty. Chicken of maki tikka were not much tender as well. It was not a good experience wrt food.

"32009259","Food was alright a good 8/10, but, there was almost zero attention given to us in terms of service., and we had to wait a good 10 minutes even before we were given the Menu. And, this was at a time, when the only table occupied inside the restaurant was us. Outside, there were probably 2 tables occupied. Surprising that they couldn't manage 3 tables. Maybe this is a harsh review and there was an event happening at the hotel and they were understaffed., but, for a hotel chain like Hyatt, not acceptable.",1,"2018-12-16 11:22:05",5,22,0

"30008545","Sadly our visit to Hyatt wasn't the type one would want to remember. We were attempting to use Zomato gold - out of the 4 of us, 2 had gold and to start with they told us we would need to physically sit on different tables to use both gold memberships! Note : it was 2:30 at night and the WHOLE restaurant was completely empty. We suggested let's do two bills and create the notion of 2 tables if needed (why though I don't know, Zomato clearly says there is no limit of how many gold's can be used at a table) but even that was not agreeable, they just kept repeating we would need to physically move to two separate tables!! Needless to say, the visit just went down hill from there :(

"1334924","Had an amazing brunch at Collage, Hyatt Hyderabad. 
I generally stay away from clicking pics at a buffet unless it’s something on our table but we were smitten by the desserts so much that I couldn’t resist clicking them. Each dessert was an amazing piece of craftsmanship, delicately plated and arranged (esp for something at a buffet). 
The food and spread were equally awesome. There was Sushi 😍, Mexican 😍, Indian, Asian and Pizza.
The Mexican spread was plenty with nachos being my favorite as they came with lot of sides like guacamole, salsa, mango salsa and Parmesan. Didn’t explore the Asian side much but they had steamed veg and chicken momos. The live counters consisted of pindi chole, several types of paranthas, appam & stew. 
The sushi was good but not great, especially the wasabi didn’t have a strong flavor. But being a buffet we were still satisfied with what they had. 
The ambiance was really pleasant initially when we were seated. Later when we started sweating though we realized we were seated at a bad table as it was nearer to the door leading to the outside dinning area and that is where they also placed their live counters. Although they could close the door it was constantly getting opened and no one bothered to close it. ",4,"2018-09-24 16:01:24",169,1739,8
"599625","Visited this place yesterday after going through some of the very good reviews and I must say it's the worst experience for us, we ordered pizza and it smelled very bad . Secondly we ordered Caesar salad and chicken was rubbery and we ended up eating only salad then we ordered club sandwich and spaghetti pasta , club sandwich was OK but again spaghetti was tasteless and bland and had to leave whole dish. Didn't expected such a bad quality food from brand like Hyatt and they ended up spoiling our evening .",1,"2018-09-22 12:12:18",3,46,0

With all the taste, ambience and service it is totally worth eating.
Only thing I would complain about was staff need more clarity on Zomato gold as I was being given wrong bill and it took me sometime to make them understand that there way of deduction does not comply with T&C given by Zomato, hope that is taken care so as no other customer face the inconvenience.

Food - Mushroom soup and veg sushi were quite well made. Tried Japanese style Udon noodles along with Japanese curry and maybe it is a matter of taste but both the dishes had excess soya sauce making them salty and bitter. I was later told that the noodles should be paired with Yamakazi whiskey and the curry with Jasmine rice to counter the soya sauce taste. It sounded like a good advice but a little late for this time. For dessert, brownie with ice cream was ordered and it was easily the best item. Overall pricing is decent for the quality and ambience.

The food is good definitely, but for a Sunday brunch the options are extremely limited compared to what's being offered around. I am thankful to the staff for pulling together a cheese platter just to accompany my wine and for that I took them to 4 from my initial 3* . Sometimes the smiles and the courtesy make a lot of difference and might want me to visit again. The beverage (alcohol 😋) menu is very limited , does not match back to others - I hope they match it up. We had to separately order drinks as there was nothing on their selection that we drank !! 😋.

Continental, Chinese or Italian whatever you like, you can Try anything since it’s the combination of all with a pinch of Indian dishes also. The environment is really nice and the staff is polite and  helpful. The red velvet pudding was my favourite with other type of pastries. The presentation of the dishes was also nice. The main attraction was the live kitchen to serve you your noodles and pasta . ",5,"2018-06-30 14:35:25",34,51,0

"37381843","Friday afternoon, lunch, Collage - Hyatt Gachibowli. Awesome!! So being a foodie both me and my wife, when we have the option almost every time we’ll choose the buffet. So did today. The food was delicious, almost every each item was tasteful, very few were on the average side. They have 3 main counters, one with asian food, one continental, and one with soup, salads and desserts. The have have live chat counter and they will cook pizza and pasta if you have a request. I think that the stars of the day were salami pineapple salad and the blueberry cheese cake.
Ambiance was peaceful and having the option of eating outside (al fresco - Italian) is always a plus. Service very good, staff was quick and helpful. All in all, a very good experience.

Even though I’m a member of their “Club At The Hyatt” , I wasn’t given the membership benefit I was entitled to . Utter useless service and truly disappointed .

The fact that there were no Mangoes (its the season) was quite disappointing. Also there could have been more varieties of Paratha as there was only one Subz Paratha.
The ambience is impeccable. They have indoor as well as outdoor seating. The indoor is very comfortable and the outdoor is fun with great view and kids play area.
Very courteous and polite staff.
Will definitely revisit.

"959890","Sometimes the most unexpected evenings can turn out to be the best one. Me and my wife both food lovers don't enjoy 5 star buffets and hence we avoid. 
We ended up here as someone dear gifted us a couple dinner voucher and with just few weeks left for its validity we decide to give the place a visit on Thursday evening. 
Closeby to our office we reached the place located in Nanakramguda just near the Amazon office and opposite Waverock. 
We presented the voucher and they guided us inside with a preference of outdoor or indoor seating. We choose the former. 
The ambience us very nice dimly lit with slow breeze.. would be even better during winter months. 
We ordered for some cold drinks and went onto explore the buffet.  A fine spread with a good assortment of Indian and continental dishes. One could take noodles and pasta from live counters. 
Starters 
Soups , salads , dimsum, fried chicken- the options for typical Indian starters are less- when enquired by the staff attending us about the quality we told them about the having less of Indian starters - they promptly arranged for some fried fish and chicken 
Main course 
Biryani rice, wet varieties of chicken, mutton and fish, one could lean into the continental side too with fried rice and noodles 
Desserts 
The best spread in Hyd from my experience. It ranged from variety of sweet bakery products to the Indians traditional sweets. None of them will disappoint you. People who have a habit of starting the buffet backwards are in for a treat
Overall we spent about 3 hours chit chatting enjoying the food and experience amazing service. Must recommended for people who want to just unwind after a hectic work day

"44600846","There are two restaurants, and they are Collage, a multi cuisine restaurant and Deori, authentic India cuisine restaurant. I always have my breakfast and dinner at Collage except the first day at this hotel.
Many service staffs take order and serve foods. All of them are thorough in the mindset of serving customers. Especially, among these staffs, [Parmeshwar] and [Lalmalsawmi] have very good sense of service, and are outstanding to understand what customers really want.
From the moment of entry to the Collage to the exit, they really care about my moving path within the restaurant. In case of Parmeshwar, he always greets me with smiley face and guides me to my table. He always asks my feeling of the day and recommends the food as per my mood. He is always getting me things I ask for and never forgets brings me things whereas others sometimes forgets as they are always busy and be asked by other customers for things on their way to get something I ask for. He has very good knowledge and insights of the industry and field in which he work and talk with me the way it needs to be improved for better service. As for Lalmalsawmi, she always keeps an eye on me. She brings me chopsticks or Kimchi, depending on the food I order even though I do not ask. She knows how many ice cubes I like in a glass depending on the types of beverages I drink. She never forgets to have water bottles frozen in a freezer a day before I play golf because I drink a lot of water while I play golf under the smoking hot weather. This is something I even forget myself and that is why I really want to thank her. Generally, the grade of service from this restaurant is excellent, but as I mentioned above, I specially want to convey a lively sense of gratitude from the bottom of my heart.",5,"2017-11-17 19:47:25",1,2,0
"47860409","I have been staying at Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli for seven (7) weeks as of today.
First, my stay at this hotel could not be any better because of the services and hospitality that this hotel is providing to me especially in terms of food.
My first concern in terms of going abroad is about food. I usually go on business trips for more than three months staying at one country. Regardless of your nationality, just imagine how hard it would be to have food, which you have never had in your life, and you have to deal with the food more than one month. When you stay at a hotel and the hotel prepares same of similar dishes almost every day, you will be easily sick and tired of having the food all the time. Besides, India is a country where it is hard to find restaurants that serve pork or beef dishes. Furthermore, as being a Korean, cilantro or coriander are something that we are not used to and do not use in the food cooking, but most dishes in India are with this herb regardless of the type of food; Italian, Japanese Thai or Chinese. However, I find foods at this Collage restaurant at Hyatt Hyderabad is not using those herbs for Western or Asian food, and this is what I like this restaurant the best. Besides, for buffet dinner, majority of the food are daily changed. I personally consider this the most important factor for long-term stay guest just like me.
Therefore, my food life at Collage @Hyatt Hyderabad is always happy because of so much efforts the <<chef Prashant>>, <<chef Pushkar>>, <<chef Sankhar>> and <<chef Santosh>>, are putting into to cater my taste. In addition, they study Korean food or other Asian food and cook for me as special treatment to please me. Sometimes, we even talk about food making and recipes, and they cook some special food as per my special request. 
During breakfast and dinnertime, these chefs always come to my table and ask if the buffet foods at the Collage restaurant fit my taste.
I strongly recommend everyone that Collage is a place you must have meals during your stay at Hyderabad. Lastly, through this review, I sincerely express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart.",5,"2017-11-16 22:52:11",1,44,23

"320182","Was visiting my in laws for the first time. To celebrate the occasion we came here after more than hour long drive. And oh boy, did this place disappoint!? Not only did they lack the basic services like serving Papad and water in the beginning, they made blunders like serving Long Island Ice tea to a pregnant woman instead of the lemon ice tea that she ordered. We were a group of 11 people and were seated in a private room. We had to keep going out of the room to call the waiters only to be responded with an arrogant attitude, especially by the restaurant manager Parmeshwar from Lucknow. Each order took a long time to come and was served cold. And when I say served, I don't mean served by them. Oh no, the waiters simply kept all the dishes on one side of the table and left it to us to serve ourselves. Despite of this, on lack of better judgment, we made a horrible mistake of ordering the dessert which we just left after a bite because it was that bad. Needless to say, our night was ruined and to end it all, just when we thought it can't get any worse, they over billed us. We spent 20 mins to get it corrected. The icing on the cake was, the charged us for the Long Island Ice Tea as well 😂😂. 
Please avoid this place at all costs. And you'll be saving a LOT! 😅 You'll also save yourselves from mosquito bites because they'll refuse to provide you with a mosquito repellent when you ask for it. 
P. S- If you're a cheese enthusiast, please don't make the same mistake of ordering the cheese platter as we did. For ₹600, they served us stale cheese with few almonds, crackers and 2 apricots. Whoever originally came up with this dish, must have shifted somewhere n his/her grave when these people had the audacity to serve something like this to us.  ",1,"2017-08-19 17:11:43",92,495,0

Except the place, nothing was good. Specially the Menu and the food was not really good.
The items on the buffet were so limited that I hardly had anything to eat. Multi-Cuisines (On the website: Continental, Italian, North Indian, Chinese, Asian, Thai), but in reality only continental and Asian.
That too without a chicken starter in the continental department and the Fish served was so salty that it was not at all eatable. Not even a single Indian item was found in the entire menu.

Very less options of non-veg on the buffet both in Indian & western.
Only a chicken pie, & an oriental chicken dish inside. In the Indian had only Biryani & raara gosht. 
The highlight was in place like Hyatt your serving Vada Pav as part of the sunday brunch, come on you must be really kidding me, I am sure you can do better than this. 😀
Lauki mussalam on the vegetarian spread just to name a few of the not so appetising options there. ☹️
Pizza was just like an Indian papad with some dry chicken and cheese on top.

So, buffet breakfasts is something I particularly enjoy and the one I had at Collage, Hyatt Hyderabad was quite a decent one at that. 
Hyatt Gachibowli is a beautifully done property and Collage is one of its pretty restaurants. With a variety of options to choose from, the buffet breakfast a quite a steal.
From American favorites like muffins, donuts, waffles and croissants to Indian delicacies like Masala Dosa, Idli and Usal pav, most of the things were delectable. Fresh cut fruits, juices and salads, live omelet counter, tea, coffee, milk, different types of juices, a selection of breads, different types of jams and cheese, well, the list is endless.
