"53868330","The shawarma that I ordered was ruamli one. Package with good tinder chicken and ghee. Taste was good. Dinning place was not that much. But only one variety was available.",4,"2018-11-08 21:31:36",1,1,0
"1899822","I had this shawarma by chance. I missed my bus to bangalore and while i waited for a cab to chase down the bus, i thought of eating something first. 
I packed in two shawarma's as Bangalore shawarmas are like small pockets ..one is never enough :p. The uncle told me to get one samoli and one special. The special shawarma was a rumali roti one. I was shocked when i saw that the rumali roti was warmed by using ghee. I was a bit sceptical but ready to try something new. Oh lord... dont know it was the hunger or else but it tasted awesome! Packed with chicken, toum and roasted in ghee.. wow! It was wow. So yes, def worth a try.",5,"2018-09-28 11:39:16",10,71,0
"35487821","Tasteless shawarma. They are adding uncooked oil, chilli powder directly to the meat. Place across the street is much better. Shah Ghouse is also close by. I will not go here again.",1,"2018-07-19 00:44:18",5,21,0
"700569","One of the best shawarma. The best thing here is that they give hummus in a bottle which we can have as much as we want. To have kuboos roti/pita bread we need to be there early because whenever i was late the only option i had is rumali and samoli.",4.5,"2016-08-17 16:20:57",142,221,0
"33054520","I was hungry in the evening and wanted to have some thing quick. Being a hardcore Non vegeterian, my first option is to bite some chicken n stuff instead of a samosa or some chat... when i was looking for something in those lines, found this small lil place and i immediately rushed towards it. ordered one chicken shawarma. tasted nice and i have immediately ordered one more..... good joint...",4,"2016-02-11 19:49:27",19,8,0

One of the few shawarma options that are available in this side of the city and they are decent , serving beef and chicken in Rumali roti or Samoli which is the hot dog bun.
Had parcels to be picked up from Al-saba on two occasions and while we waited we decided to have shawarma here. The quantity was decent enough and the meat was well cooked so no complaints there. The sauce ( garlic mayo ) could have been more tastier as it was bland.  spice level were non existent and they didn't have any chilli sauce .
Overall : A decent place to satiate your craving of shawarma's 
Overall : one of the better options of shawarma in that side of the citypalatejournals.com",3.5,"2015-08-21 19:10:30",265,2214,0
"30840683","Order #134408. We ordered through Zomato at 10PM (to be delivered by 10.40) and a order confirmation SMS was sent but no delivery was made even after an hour. It's already 11PM and no other options left to try out. Really not acceptable!!",1,"2015-07-12 23:00:48",1,6,0

Shawarma is something very dear to me, got a hang of it from my Bangalore stay of 5 years. 
The thing I like the most about shawarma is, it can fill your hunger pangs instantly making you feel heavy.
I mostly prefer shawarma as an evening snack. 
When I was going back home from office, my shawarma craving was at its peak and wanted to try the nearby Al labbaik shawarma. So, without wasting any time was there and ordered shawarma romali. 
For benefit of those who are new to options in shawarma, there will be two types one being samoli and other being romali. 
In both the options the filling what you get will be the same with only difference being the wrap. For romali it will be a romali roti wrap where as for samoli it would be a bun.
Honestly speaking I never like the samoli and I always stick to romali. 
After 10min of preparation came the moment of truth, the shawarma matched my expectations and dowsed my craving for that day :)
All said and done as there are not many options in that area for shawarma and if you want a decent shawarma do hit this place OR if your hunger allows you to drive till toli chowki there are many more options out there. 
Raghav ......Bon apetite.",3,"2015-06-24 22:27:29",93,416,0
"806305","This is a kiosk kind of place, serving some decent shawarma's.
Location: Right in front of Al-Saba, Gachibowli. Diagonally opposite to Cyberabad police commissionerate.
I had chicken Shawarma with rumali. It tasted average, but the chicken filling is good. The quality and taste of mayo needs to improved. They do serve other items but I hardly find any one eating them. Shawarma with rumali/kuboos (flat bread) is the fastest moving item over here.
Nothing fancy about this place. Saying that, considering the vicinity where there are not many options to have shawarma, this could be a decent place to grab a quick bite.Nothing much to talk about ambiance too, though few chairs are spread across to sit in front of this place. 
Cost: Very reasonable, 70/- rupees for chicken shawarma. No complaints. 
Overall, a decent affair.",3,"2015-06-08 22:52:23",77,1439,2
"1579190","By far the worst shawarma I ever had. The chicken was so dry and stale that we can't chew it. Chew alone I got bones in it. Rumali also is not good and there's considerably no mayonnaise in it at all. Better to stay away from it.",1,"2015-06-03 19:07:50",2,0,0
