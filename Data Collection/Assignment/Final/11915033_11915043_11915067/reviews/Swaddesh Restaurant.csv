"29672183","Swaddesh situated above the maruti showroom in gachibowli is a multicuisine restaurant with delicious preparations. We came at about 8pm and tried the mutton seekh for starter and their swaddesh special biryani. Service was prompt and they have a nice view of hitec city road. Conveniently enough there is a bar and club above called Pour House 7. Would definitely recommend.",5,"2019-05-06 23:35:26",21,171,5

"41674847","Extremely quite place to visit. We were the only people in the restaurant. If not for the gold benefits this restaurant might be out favor given it's visibility near Biodiversity park.
Ordered Murgh makhamali tikka and Thai chicken tikka with no specific expectations. Chicken was properly cooked and juicy. Didn't felt like eating anything stale given the fact that we were the only diners though the Thai chicken could have been better.
In main course we ordered assorted breads and Dal Makhni. Portions were enough for two Big eaters.
On the whole it seems to be an underrated restaurant. Cost for two people will be close to Rs1000 not Rs500 as shown by Zomato.",4,"2019-02-23 22:34:53",3,2,0
