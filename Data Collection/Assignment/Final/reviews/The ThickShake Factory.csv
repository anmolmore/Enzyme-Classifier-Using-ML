The shakes are packed in a sealer plastic glass and they serve a thick straw and a spoon with it.
Ferrero rocher is one of the best shakes which I have tried from this place and I would recommend it to you.
I have also tried their Mint and cookie shake which is expensive than Ferrero rocher shake but inferior in taste.
I actually didn't like that they put a Good day cookie in the Mint and cookie shake.
Anytime you want to quench your thirst by having your favourite ice cream shake, pop up your Zomato / Swiggy app and order from this place and I can vouch that you will love it. ",4,"2019-04-11 00:59:09",328,1858,0
"37794020","I would prefer milkshakes over thickshakes. You drink a thickshake and you are like completely full.
Must try : Belgium chocolate shake
Other shakes are okayish.",4,"2019-04-05 13:16:12",18,18,1
"39819841","In the picture: Ferrero Rocher Thickshake
Since the very first day I tried thickshakes from The Thickshake Factory, I have been loving them. But over the time, I have realized that not all the branches have the same quality thickshakes. I have had my share of bad experiences.
But this branch, has never disappointed me. I have both, visited this branch and ordered online. Both the experiences have been really good. The thickshakes are true to their name, i.e. they have that 'thick' consistency where you need to have it with a spoon. The packaging for the online orders are also commendable.
I have also tried the Belgian Chocolate Thickshake. Even that tastes amazing!

"978938","Thickshake factory was the he normal thickshake factory and the milkshake was nice,though they did not have the wonder woman shake which was a real disappointment .
The best part of this thick shake factory was the colorful and the beautiful ambiance, they should really keep the good work up.

"2644474","The go-to place for milkshake lovers...
Be judicious about your choice- some of their shakes are to die for, while others can prove to be a bit flat...
Some of my personal favourites are Belgian chocolate, Choco brownie crumble and Banana berry ",4,"2018-11-25 23:12:29",9,6,0

"52287600","One of the worst thickshake outlets I have seen so far. Forgets toppings in the order, repeats that recklessly. When opted delivery, they just send the frozen one if already done and freezed. Out of 10 only 2 orders have the thickshake standards. Serious attention needed by the thickshake management as it dents both the reputation and sales.",2,"2018-11-05 23:08:40",3,1,0
"35422959","Good shakes available, a mere copy of keventers though. if a lover of keventers, thick shake factory is something you would not like. It can be better by inducing new shakes.",4,"2018-11-01 09:57:59",91,126,1
"8169781","I was waiting for my son to finish the exams in the 9th floor. This is a good place to wait and have a thick shake. The place is clean and the shakes delightful. I picked up two for home and the lady at the counter packed it well with a foil. The service is prompt. It was a Sunday so there was not much of a crowd. I saw a few parents waiting like me. The price is okay for the four blobs of ice cream that go into one shake.",4,"2018-10-29 13:48:00",61,1188,0
"46312205","They have a nice variety of thickshakes and tbh, the coffee+chocolate ones are a must try.
I am not really fond of their slushes however, they are decent.",4,"2018-10-06 17:26:48",15,23,0
"52120955","Cool place to grab a shake. Nice ambience and variety. The shakes are also ultimate. Visited during Hyderabad trip. Value for money in the sense that one shake makes you full and content. Though you wish for more! Service is a bit slow. ",4,"2018-08-19 15:49:49",19,4,0
"44725617","I was in love with thickshakes when I saw how a ferroro- rochero thickshake was made in front of me and was served to me with all the chill ness and smiles of the staff around it. The addition of hazelnut ice cream, cream , chocolates syrup and the sweet sound of the blender blending your thickshake and finally being topped with my favourite chocolate ferroro-rochero is a total bliss. Though the menu has been changed but I still enjoy the new one with ferroro- rochero as topping to hazelnut thickshake. #Happiness served. ",4,"2018-08-15 18:21:22",34,51,0

I orderdered from here and even after 45 mins, the order was not prepared. Such wait time is completely unacceptable.",1,"2018-08-12 01:10:06",16,251,0

"50071238","Thickshakes in this place are the best is what I feel. Unlike some other outlets, they don't mix water with shakes and keep it as perfect as it could. Cozy lil space with some few games in there. Open 24 hours but after 1 am outsiders are not allowed. Although the staff is kind enough to bring you your order till main gate if required. All in all you can takeaway or chill for an hour playing uno. Thumbs up for space utilisation. Definitely a multiple visit place ‚úå",5,"2018-04-21 22:38:41",19,53,0

"35378126","Great thickshakes and value for money. Added chunks of dairymilk and kitkat as whole in thickshakes gives it new flavour. Best thickshakes but quantity of shake must increase if number of toppings increase
Must try belgium chocolate thickshake with kitkat and dairymilk/oreo as topping. Adding all 3 toppings make drink very solid and saturated. ",5,"2017-07-14 09:04:05",5,0,0

Has a alot of great shakes n cold coffees.  Choco coffee and mango delite are great. If you are order from swiggy u can get chocolate chip blueberry shake which i recently tried but it was too sweet for my taste. If u have a sweet tooth  you should try it.

"1361020","This Thickshake Factory outlet near my home remains open till 3 in the night - it is blessing for us on party nights. 
The place has a cute but small seating arrangement with fun activities to pass you waiting time - jenga, uno and books. The staff is extremely cordial and prompt. 
My favourites one here are - Veryy Berry, Banana Havana and Fererro Rocher ones. The consistency is brilliant and I love their orange plastic straws and spoons. Each shake can actually suffice two - though I love having one for myself. Definitely recommended.",4.5,"2017-05-12 14:23:17",137,1011,3

But the fact that we can customize everything from the base to the topping is exciting. Also, some of their regular shakes like vanilla with oreo are great.
The whole place however gives a great feel, with games and books lying around, and it is the perfect place to go at night with friends, hangout, and have an enjoyable time.",3.5,"2017-04-24 23:37:11",145,634,3
"30491407","I love this place so much, their Belgian Chocolate thick-shake is my favorite. I love how it's sooo delicious and chocolatey, yet not overly sweet. Another drink I like from here is the mint choco-chip. I love how refreshing it is, but I think it could be a little bit more chocolatey. They also have cute games like snake and ladder that you can play with your friends.",4,"2017-03-27 12:46:10",23,61,0

"39123075","New Thick Shake place in town and how could i miss it üòâ !¬†
The Thick Shake Factory, if you ask me to describe this outlet in few words I would say small,cute,elegant place ! Located at Kapil towers opposite ICICI towers in financial district. its a pretty elegant looking place. I was passing by from that road and happened to stop by to try some of their Thick Shakes. I really liked their ambiance a lot. Utilization of small place has been done perfectly with outer seating area. When i went there for the 1st time i straight way ordered for fruit based Thick Shake coz they are one of my favs. There is only one staff as is now and he is pretty fast with his work. I would go any day to try their ""Lovely Litchi "" & ""Ferraro hazelnut"" Shakes ‚ò∫

"33862743","After seeing my love for chocolate, shakes and ice creams a friend suggested me this place. Ah! The menu seemed heavenly. Being an avid lover of Belgian chocolate I ordered a Belgian chocolate thick shake. The taste was good and thickness was awesome. The staff was very polite and courteous and suggested me a lot of things which made my thick shake taste amazing. 
I have visited the place thrice. I tired the triple chocolate thickshake and the litchi thickshake but didn't like the taste much they being over sweet. 
They have a big fat menu and I will definitely be exploring some more options in the near future.
I would definitely recommend this place !! It is totally worth it !!",4,"2017-03-01 06:33:21",17,37,0
