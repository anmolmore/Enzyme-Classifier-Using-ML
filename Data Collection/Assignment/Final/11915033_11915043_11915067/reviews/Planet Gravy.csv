"1231480","Planet Gravy - Searched zomato to see if there is any outlet is available to order during mid night and found this place , I must say the food was very decent at this time. We ordered Chilly Paneer and Gobi Fried Rice. Chilly Paneer was excellent in all aspects, paneer was very smooth with decent amount of gravy along with good amount of capsicum.
Gobi fried rice was not so spicy but was good. 
Quanity is very good for the price and going to order again from this place. Not sure why this is so underrated. 
Special mention about the super fast delivery, the food was delivered within 30 minutes.
