"32653827","With the kind of price they have for the buffet, I would call this as my worst buffet experience ever. The vegetarian people I had accompanied had nothing to eat at all. There was not even a single paneer starter. And for non-vegetarians, there was nothing except chicken being served.¬† We don't expect such food for this cost and venue.",1,"2019-05-15 16:31:23",3,25,0
"30497094","We went for a lunch with our team, and all of us were truly disappointed with the food and the service as well. For vegans, they had just 2 starters.. the food did not had any taste, it was more like just things being mixed without any skills. Desserts were little better, but main course was completely disappointing, be it the dal makhani, which lacked consistency, or the paneer, which was like cubes poured on top of the gravy. I certainly would have tasted better food than this at pretty lower costs.",1,"2019-05-15 16:27:45",16,46,0

Ambiance, food, pricing are all perfect. You should never minis their desserts as you'll not even have space for all the desserts in place. We visited this place on our friend's birthday and they surprised us with cute little cakes and birthday wishes. Will soon visit this place again. ",5,"2019-04-30 22:37:04",62,84,7

"87796412","I had the pleasure of having breakfast, lunch and dinner here at various times for an entire week and I was simply amazed to experience an entirely different level of hospitality and customer delight at this place! The staff ensure that they have a great connect with all the guests and cater to even the tiniest of the guests' requirements. I tried the A-la-carte menu as well as the Buffet here and loved every bit of the food that was served. Chef Chinmay Panda, Chef Abhay Kumar Sahoo and Ms Hema were the perfect hosts every time! There was an instance when the Chef inquired about our food preferences and specially prepared French Toast and mind blowing Idiappam for us! Once they knew that we were checking out from the hotel that day, they specially got us a pastry with the words 'Bon Voyage' engraved in chocolate on the serving dish. They even took a photo with us for their archives. I was completely overwhelmed by such a warm gesture and fabulous fabulous hospitality! Best of luck to the team at Feast and hope you scale greater heights in maintaining such high level of customer service!",5,"2019-04-23 23:09:56",20,0,6

The variety of salads is different and delicious. The main course is really good and specially the Dal Makhani. And all my rating goes to the desserts. They are plenty and you can‚Äôt get over each and every item. Definitely a place to over eat . ",4,"2019-04-11 17:02:30",23,9,0

The best part is Desserts. There is so much variety , that you can't have it all and the greed for it will not satisfy.

Hospitality:¬†Couldn't have asked for better.
Ambiance:¬†Perfect!
Food:¬†Now comes the real part,¬†
I went on a 10th of February 2019 and they were celebrating Avengers then. People in Thor & Captain America costumes with desserts all being prepared according to the theme gave us a cheerful theme to feast on. The wide spread of the food with varied cuisines and live music just made my day. Chat corner serving Pani Puri and various types of chats, Fish Poppers, Spaghetti, Biryani, Tikkas, Naan, Roti, Chicken curry and a long list of sumptuousness makes me go again.¬†
Frills:¬†So on that specific day, there was a photographer who clicked everyone with the superheros and gave us a print of the same, which was such a delight.
Thanks for making the experience special.
P.S.: It was all worth",5,"2019-04-02 14:02:50",51,3370,13

"33593508","Standing true to its 5-star ambience, the food gels to fit in the category of a premium outing. Salads, Chat, North Indian, Continental to South Indian, this place tends to fulfil the cravings of each category. There was a huge section of Salads out of which Bacon salad being the pick of the lot. The Starters spread included Hummus varieties with dry and soft pita breads, Farm fresh cheese varieties which were a delight, Live chat and Pasta counters, Tawa fish, Fish fry, Chicken starters, Pork pepperoni, Sauted mushrooms, Chicken Salami, Bacon, Sausages etc. ¬†
The Main course had Chicken Haleem which was okaish, Chicken Biryani which was good, Mutton curry where I felt the pieces were undercooked, Mirchi ka salan, Veg Biryani and some veg curries. The main course could have been better in terms of the standard of taste set by the starters. Prawns and Crab items were missing which could have furthermore enhanced the visit experience. The desserts section was an absolute joy for sweeth tooth. They had a humungous spread of sweets which included Chocolate burfi sandwich, mud pudding, motichoor laddu, Barfis, Moong dal Halwa, Phirni, Fruit kheer etc. The pastries section had a lot to offer in terms of various flavours and varieties.

Feast is one of the biggest spreads I saw in a buffet..  It has continental, Chinese and Indian cuisine and chats with a huge variety.. The ambiance is decent.. But Probably it could be improved.. 
I would like first start with the desserts section.. There are many.. The very sight can be deadly to a diabetic patient.. Perfect place for ppl with a sweet tooth.. A big selection of pastries, cheese cakes along with many Indian specialties.. 
There was chicken, fish and mutton for starters.. I couldn't see prawns.. Chicken popcorn was so crispy on the outside and the chicken soft in the inside.. The best starter of all.. The other starters are okeyish.. 
In the main course, chciekn biryani and Lal Maas were the best.. Overall a very good experience.. üëç

They served 18+4 varieties of cold & hot desserts which are prepared by their own and not outsourced.

Coming to the food, the spread was lavish. Especially the desserts were amazing and are definitely the highlight of the buffet. However, we ordered mocktails which were a disappointment. Further, there were hardly any starters which was definitely something that we did not expect.

"48540202","Yesterday, as always I went out for family dinner. We wanted to try something new. My wife searched for a highly rated restaurant¬†and found this restaurant¬†on Google. As I'm Sheraton/ Marriot Platinum member (42216744521/791050313) and had the best experience in past, I thought this would be a good choice. We booked the table. We started the food but soon we realized that we¬†have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. We opted to go with Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food¬†was cold, not even warm. I did not like the food much. It was not even okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. Anyway, we finished our food and came back. Now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest¬†water as well. The whole night he was vomiting. And, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. We rushed to the hospital [Continatal] and the doctor clearly¬†said it is food poising. We went to flashback and realized my wife and younger¬†son had come vegetable¬†team, which may have caused¬†the vomiting. Eldor son had pasta so he was good.¬†
Very disappointing¬†experience from Sheraton. I have to think about my relation with Sheraton in the future.",1,"2019-02-25 14:44:03",2,1,0
"2166304","A very good example of a very bad restaurant service!¬†
Sheraton was always on my top my list but Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad has changed everything.
To start with Service is so bad here, we had to beg for serving drinking water.
The quality of food is ok and fish fry was stale.
linen napkins on the table are not properly washed or might be used ones.
To sum up, the experience was terrible and not expected from Sheraton. #unhappy",1,"2019-02-25 12:24:54",3,11,0

But the thing that spoiled our evening was their pathetic service and attitude. There was almost zero attention to customers. You go there and sit at the table and no one even comes and serves water or anything. No one guides or provides instructions. Basically you are supposed to go and start serving yourself as if you are in some langar and not a high end restaurant. Even for the bill we had to go the counter and ask thrice.

When I went the spread had a mix of Chinese, Italian, Continental, and South & North Indian food.¬†
The only thing that disappointed me was the mutton. It was a bit undercooked. It was to my surprise to find an undercooked food in such a big hotel.
Desert, I feel they can do a lot more but I can vouch for the baked yogurt, the taste is just heaven and you can eat as much as you want as all the desert are sugar-free.

Speaking about the food,it has a great variety from Indian,Italian,Asian and Continental. The variety of desserts are the best in class,in which I liked most of them. The ones I personally liked are Chicken popcorn,Dahiwada,Rasmalai,Mutton Biryani, Chicken Margherita Pizza and the Amritsari Fish. For me,a 5/5 for the Feast-Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel .",5,"2019-01-05 23:45:31",4,38,0

"32134747","Went for Christmas Buffet Lunch. We were 4 of us. The staff were very friendly, courteous and cooperative. 5/5 for the service. But the food was very very disappointing. The starters were unmentionable. The chat counter, Palak Chaat was good but kanji Vada was pathetic. In Italian, we asked him to serve us ravioli, which was very hard and the worst we have had. The saving grace was the Indian counter. The curries, Biryani, bread etc. were all good. I think the restaurant should stick to Indian and not venture into other cuisines till they are better prepared to do so. ",3,"2019-01-01 08:40:12",290,790,0
"2457358","We were a group of 10 out on a team lunch. We opted for a mix of veg and non veg buffet. The spread, right from the salads to the dips and the desserts was wide and each of the individual dishes were delectable. Do try the Dal makhni and Indian dessert options.
This is a must try place and worth the money you pay for the experience. ",5,"2018-12-31 23:29:36",9,1,0
"30307683","Sheraton is one of the best hotels in Hyderabad but their restaurant fails to match the expectations.
I have come here twice for the Buffet and the only good thing was some desserts.They have very few options in Vegetarian starters.Pizza is not of the best quality whole pasta is good.
Their desserts looks mind-blowing but only few of them are actually very good.
Ambiance is pretty amazing but it's not the worth the price you pay for the kind of food you get here.",3,"2018-12-31 00:08:06",179,1874,0

They have a live pasta counter, but it was absolutely pathetic. There was no seasoning, just plain tasteless pasta and sauce. Even the mocktails are overpriced and average. There are far better buffet places in Hyderabad where you could get amazing food for nearly half the price. Would not recommend. ",2,"2018-12-15 02:46:51",2,2,0

From food, to taste, to hygiene, to the supporting staff, to the ambience - nothing just made me food good and welcomed. We were a group of people who went there and none of us were happy with the food, or the food spread, or the taste specially. I remember nothing from what I ate as extraordinarily good. I have been to westin buffet, novotel buffet, trident buffet, avasa buffet and alllllll were way way better than this place. There has been absolutely no work done on the ambience to look pretty or attractive. It also wasn't that clear like other restau. the place did not even smell good.
