"16174233","A new place. Fairly convenient for people working in ""The Financial District""
Time provide happy hour offers. Relatively quiet place. Seating arrangement is good. Closed places available for official work.
Good food- however most of the menu items are not available. The beer happy hour is not on pints. Music needs to be mmm - they need to put on some good playlist with better speakers.
And as I stated the first thing, a new place. So might need some time to ramp up",3,"2018-11-29 21:42:12",47,143,0

"33557051","Visited this place for a quick pint of beer after a long day. If you are looking for a quiet place to visit to just chill then it's a pretty nice place. The food was average, nothing extra-ordinary about it but it's good enough.
The problem with this place is the service. We hac a sour experience with the waiters. Starting from taking wrong orders, bringing wrong items, asking us to take items that we had clearly cancelled to a general attitude issue; we kind of faced it all. It was a good evening but the behavior of the service staff put a bad taste to it.

"1553550","The F-District located in the same building that houses,Deli9,Dominos is the place to go if you wish to spend quality time with friends coupled with amazing service,food and liquour being served late into the night.
Apart from the drinks the place serves lip-smacking food as well their starters especially their Batti Da Murgh,Chicken 65,chilling chicken need a special mention.
They have a buffet during the day which fares decently.
For the choice of food they have continental,Indian and Chinese and I am definitely gonna get back to try their continental food coupled with a few drinks.",5,"2018-03-18 17:03:23",179,1593,9

The food and drinks out here are amazing, affordable and lip smacking. This guy serves food and beverages till 4:00 am in the morning if you have group of 6-8 people or more.

As this is a new restaurant, need some time to improve is what i feel. 
Regular items are good.
Veg starters are less but okay. Cheese balls, veg manchuria and one more starter is all you get. Soup is okay.
No veg Biryani.
Staff are not responding fast for any given order.
