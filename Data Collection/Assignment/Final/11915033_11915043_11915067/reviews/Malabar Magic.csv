"33902052","I have ordered from this place multiple times. The thalassery chicken biriyani is delicious. They give good raita, mango pickle and coconut chutney as the sides. Must try. The chicken curry is also good. All in all, good food and economic. ",5,"2018-12-25 19:59:32",20,10,0
"36601207","Thalassery Chicken Biryani: 2Stars for portion and 2stars for Taste and aroma.
Although you get one Medium piece of Chicken,Rice portion is adequate for almost 2 Servings.
People ok with less spicy and know Malabar Biryani would like to have this. For Spice lovers,try something else. :)
Taste of Tomatoes is on the higher side which overruns the Spices.
Despite of lesser/No masala(compared to Hyd Biryani),you would still love to eat the rice.
Definately Value for money. A Must try and recommend.
@MalabarMagic, try to add some more authentic Kerala delicacies to your menu.
Thanks.
Keep up.",4,"2018-11-26 15:28:14",4,1,1

"33336845","I assume this is a delivery only place which offers finger licking Malabari Biriyani. Once i tried Ghee Rice and Thenga Varutharacha Chicken Curry. It was delicious. But i never came across it in the menu again. Being a malayali staying away from home, this place provides the perfect food to not miss home.

"14541441","I was willing to try out a different cuisine today and came across Malabar Magic from Zomato.
Ordered one Thalaserry Fried Chicken Dum Biryani with 5 parathas and two Chicken Curry. The food reached in no time, properly packed.
Coming to the food, the same tasted awesome. The chicken dish tasted good, the curry was rich in masalas with just the perfect spice. The porotas are just out of this world, heavy but soft,less oil. The chicken and porota went well together. The biryani is also good and brings a variety in taste who are sick and tired of Hyderabadi Biryani. The accompaniments like salaan, raita and a lemon pickle went well with the food.
Overall, a 4 out of 5. I will soon order more food from this place and would definitely try out the egg curry. However, Zomato order menu do not show all the items , for example: the egg curry or the chicken roast.
Thanks for such a great dinner at such an affordable price. ",4,"2018-07-22 20:27:22",685,792,1

"36523232","My search for an authentic kerala Malabar biriyani in Hyderabad ended here. I have tried the biriyanis from most of the other kerala restaurants in the town. This is the best for me.

"36710004","I am from Northeast part of India and food in our region is entirely different from the rest of India. However if I have to choose another cuisine other than my traditional cuisine, it would definitely be Malayali cuisine. Malabar Magic does justice to it. 
Every time I order from here, my mind is blow away. Parotha here is so soft you can eat it without any side dish or curry. The next is beef, trust me when I say that beef melt in mouth, it is that tender. Chicken curry is another favourite of mine. Spices are very well balanced and just the right amount. 
Must give it a try to understand what I typed down. Malayali food is just next level.
