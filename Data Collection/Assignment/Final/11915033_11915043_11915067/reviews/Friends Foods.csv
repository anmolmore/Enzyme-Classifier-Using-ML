"52137100","Hello Restaurant Owner,
When I was missing the taste of Tamilnadu , I came to know about this restaurant in Swiggy from then on I kept ordering atleast twice a week, now I think this restaurant is not there in swiggy and zomato. I kept on searching for this restaurant , it's taste can never be replaced by any other restaurants , so please do add it in both Swiggy and zomato. I'm sure many people were missing this restaurant like me please do add in Swiggy and zomato.
Note : The star rating is for removing the restaurant from SwiggyüôÉ not for food taste..for Food and taste I will be giving 5/5",3,"2019-01-05 20:38:10",10,2,0
"48197421","Best place to have Tamil nadu Chettinadu and Madurai style foods. Most of the items are good taste. Idiyapam/Aapam with coconut milk is pretty good. Kothu parrato is my favourite. Kurma taste is not upto the mark. Chutney and sambar is good. There are so many varieties you can try with. ",5,"2018-11-24 10:43:11",11,11,0
"35422959","One of the best places to have dosa. Best dish ever tasted here: paal parotha. Don't forget to tell him to add Hershey's chocolate or strawberry syrup for that extra bit of tinge to the taste buds.",4,"2018-11-09 15:51:27",91,126,0
"59969537","Our favourite place on weekends.... We travel arount 1 hour to reach the place almost every weekends just for the delicious mouthwatering Tamilnadu food... Pocket friendly hotel and the only drawback is the ambience, who cares when they provide delicious Tamilnadu food... Hyderabadil vaazhum Thamizhargalin sorgam...",5,"2018-10-16 18:53:50",1,0,0
"29123739","I was just looking for something different food to eat and I found this in swiggy,I have ordered egg lappa and chicken kothu parota both are really mouth watering, chicken kothu parota is something I never had before,in fact I didn't find parota in that
Will strongly recommend this place to all foodies who want to try new foods",5,"2018-08-30 19:30:45",64,171,0
"50317088","For those tamilians in hyderabad who miss their hometown food, its the perfect place. It serves more than 40 varieties of dosa with other delicacies like idli and parotta. Its one among the very few places in Hyderabad that serves idiappam with coconut milk which is also delicious.
Overall, if you want to have authentic tamilnadu food at very low price with a humble service, i strongly recommend this place. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",4,"2018-06-08 12:50:48",6,5,0
"36114977","If you're out of city and missing our tasty TN food, this is the best place for you. Yes, it is a small hotel which serves only tiffin items, but does Ambience matter when the food tastes like heaven? ;) Taste namma oor parotta salna, dosa, paniyaram, idiyappam, and feel like you're home ..and don't forget to try paal parota.üòç",5,"2018-06-01 22:23:45",6,65,0
"45793215","It is a treat to Tamil tongues living in Hyderabad. U get to taste the real flavours of Tamil Nadu, with ocean of varieties. Ive tried mostly everything.. it is delicious and worth your time and money. Very cheap compared to the other food shops. Affordable to all class. ",4.5,"2018-04-17 17:53:51",3,2,3
"32159204","A huge relief for people craving for food from Tamil Nadu. Quite pocket friendly and it has a truck load of options. The Chicken Veech Porotta is by far my favourite. I try the idiyappam everytime I go there too. One must try dish is the Milk Porotta. A unique, super sweet dessert. Swathi Muthu ",5,"2018-04-05 14:19:12",115,546,5
"27264625","Extremely tasty food for affordable price!!!
My search for authentic tamil cuisine food ended here. It has always been very difficult to find proper south indian food at hyderabad. I came across this place for delivery. Seeing the options in menu I was confused what to order because everything seemed to tempting as I havent had proper tamil food for a long time.Atlast i ordered Kuzhi paniyaram and Parota kurma. Both together costs just 90rs. I was quite skeptical about the taste. After receiving the order, the kuzhi paniyaram had around 6-7 pieces with tomato and coconut chutney. The paniyaram had the exact homemade taste with the chutney. Its a heaven for people who miss home food. Parotta was also very good. The kurma was delicious with the exact amount of spiciness. I will for sure try other dishes from this restaurant.",5,"2018-02-14 14:54:40",1,39,0
"36020088","This place is like oasis in a desert for tamil nadu cuisine lovers... This place cant b rated on ambience or service because it s a very small shop.. This place cant b called a restaurant... It s aperfect place for bachelors and Bachelorettes...
Coming to the food.. They provide delicious tamil nadu food... All de items they provide here are too good... That too if tamil people r stayin away from home, This place is definitely be like heaven.. Paal parotta deserves a special mention.. Had it for the first time and it was too good..
Dishes : parotta, chicken kothu parotta, rava masala dosa, podi idli, onion rava uthappam, half boil, kalaki, mutton idiyappam, paal parotta
Food - 4
Value for money - 4
Bottomline : this place is not a restaurant... It is more like eating from the street shops.. But the food is too good",4,"2018-02-13 21:45:16",51,57,0
"34422971","I'm reducing one point of rate for the ambiance. For people who look for good ambiance this is a disappointment. It is a small shop having hardly small place to sit.
The food here is as expected. People here in Hyderabad wouldn't have tasted the best Salna parotta. I had the best chicken veechu parotta and paniyaram was good , suprisingly the taste was same as we get in Tamil nadu. 
Many types of idli, dosa and parotta are there. I would surely recommend anyone to get the best south Indian tiffen for reasonable cost. ",4,"2018-02-09 00:17:20",2,11,0
