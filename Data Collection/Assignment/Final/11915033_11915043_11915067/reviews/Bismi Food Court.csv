"50457833","Very unhappy with the pista shake(coloured sweet water) and fruit salad(custard that too only banana and papaya). Ordered online at around 330 am in the morning. If the hotel doesn't have all the ingredients he should have closed it, he cannot prepare the food with rest over ingredients",1,"2018-09-23 11:33:17",1,1,0
