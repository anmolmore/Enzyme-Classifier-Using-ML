"37584205","I ordered sabudaana vada from this place, first of all it is too pricey and secondly they don't Know how to make.upper layer was quite hard which happens when food is cooked on high flame.The indigrients we're of poor quality,sabudaana was quite hard as it was given much time for soaking,and there were hair which shows how unhygenically it was prepared.",1,"2019-04-15 02:14:32",8,0,0

"42907632","Ordered Paneer Sandwich, and trust me it was the worst sandwich I ever had. Rather, you get better sandwiches on roadside stalls. The moment I took the sandwich out of the box, the bread seemed to be falling apart. It had a very weird yellow sauce which was ruining the taste of the entire thing.",1,"2019-02-06 10:01:38",3,2,0

"56985522","Quality of Food and Packing is Very Good. Reasonable Pricing. On Time Service, the Basmati Rice was found to be of Good Quality,  Ordered for a Chicken Biryani, which was very lavishly prepared with marinated Chicken with Indian Species and Herbs. The aremo you can feel while serving the food. 
Would love to have the same, again and again..",5,"2019-01-21 13:10:06",1,3,0
