"895398","I visited on 27th Nov morning around 11am to pick up a cake. The outlet was medium crowded. As I pick up my cake and go ahead for billing, I see only one out of three billing counters is operating. Although I was the second one in the cue but the family whose billing was under process had more than 4 basket filled with items which approx would have more than 40 items. In not less than 5 mins the cue extended till 5 people waiting for the billing. When asked to the manager, to operate other billing counters he replied ""WE DON'T HAVE MANPOWER"". Frustrated with the cue, we asked how can you just have manpower for one billing counter where you have machinery available for 3 he replied, ""WE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO HIRE""!
