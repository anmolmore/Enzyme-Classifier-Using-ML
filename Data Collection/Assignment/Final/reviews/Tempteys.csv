I would rate there service as 4.5/5 , food as 4.5/5 , ambience as 4.5/5 .
I very much like the idea of writing the reviews on the wall, inside the shop itself.",4,"2019-04-30 14:00:49",6,0,1

"37794020","We have ordered from this place and it has some amazing choices we could choose from. It has an option of gelato and avalanche for the base and I have choosen gelato.
Must try : Premium forest berry shake, caramel brownie shake, Peri Peri fries.
The shakes are super yummy and I had my best shakes here. I will definitely try some more shakes.",5,"2019-04-11 13:01:44",18,18,2

"42927781","Drinks(4.5/5)- I think Tempteys and MOM rule the shakes world in terms of multiple outlets on Hyderabad.
Look out for little app/nearbuy for offers .
Shakes are good, chilly and refreshing.
My personal favorite being Oreo Shake.
Ambience-(3.5/5) The place is cool, can hangout and can have quality talk, as it is mostly empty and most orders generally are take aways.
One thing, they should at least keep the tables CLEAN. There were so many dead flies and insects on the tables which would bring disgust.
Service-(4/5) They know their work, prepare the shakes well. One suggestion is to provide water to the customers, as it seems ridiculous that you deny with the fact that you guys don't have water.
Wonder what u add in Shakes!!",4,"2019-02-12 09:57:09",84,182,2

"48710268","We went in at 1am and yet its open. Ordered Custard Maple shake, crushed almonds shake, choco brownie shake and potato wedges. The shakes are categorized into premium and classic and each category has lots of flavors to choose from and the taste is amazing. They have all flavors of premium chocolates like lindt, toblerone to local chocolates of India. The containers that shakes are given in could have been of better quality.
There are only two snack items available French Fries and Potato wedges and I feel being such a franchise they should have added more options. But the variety of toppings given makes good sense.
Overall, I liked the quality of milk shakes.",5,"2018-11-14 18:23:04",10,13,0

"32560419","Couldn't help but indulge my sweettooth in this store located in the Dlf lane. India's first to introduce Gelato as base of their shakes. You can choose your base between gelato or avalanche, which is basically yogurt based icecream.
New menu is interesting. Happy to see savoury items on the menu as well.
Tried Coffee hazelnut shake - must say the coffee is neither mild nor overpowering, just the right amount and was good. It's loaded with whipped cream topped with choco chips.
Caramel Brownie shake--- now this is a stealer. Would give a 5 just for this. Probably the best caramel shake I ever had. Total yumminess. Even the colour is drool worthy. A must try here. Yes the sugar content is high and too sweet. Some pampering for your sweet tooth.
Peri peri fries - how interesting is it to get options for your fries, when you even love them as such. I opted for peri peri spice and it tasted good and is for someone who really like their fries spicy
Tried crushers passion fruit flavour which was okayish ",4,"2018-10-06 20:17:51",221,856,6
"32084316","Definitely a good place for the milkshakes and some munchies.
Personally i liked choco coffee hut and crunchy almond feast and the milkshakes feel so good with french fries and potato wedges.
Service is so friendly and quick, even the place feels so comfortable just go and grab a shake to get your self relaxed.",5,"2018-10-04 22:27:35",22,85,7
"1340057","Great shakes are kind of a given when it comes to Tempteys, and this branch is no different. Delicious shakes, tried the Coffee Hazelnut, Merry Cherry, and Cheesecake flavours. Merry Cherry was my favourite of the lot.
What I did not expect were the amazing fries and wedges, we absolutely cleaned the boxes out.
Service was also impeccable, really quick.",5,"2018-10-04 21:27:08",15,81,3
"1226687","Beside the Radisson hotel lane is one of the best Tempteys outlets I have been to. I might have to get my sugar tooth removed after such sweetness overload.
The service is fast, even with constant incoming swiggy orders the staff managed to serve the ala carte customers quickly too.
Must have are the newly introduced Forest Berry milkshake and the Choco coffee hut.
Definitely a good place to drop by for well made milkshakes and fries/wedges in Gachibowli area.",5,"2018-10-04 20:23:42",166,251,1

The best thing about them is that they use their own brand Gelato ice cream which is particularly on the healthy side.
Had the pleasure of tasting the new menu a couple of days back
The poppy corn was a nice change of pace
The cookie caramel flavoured were my personal favorite.
Highly recommend this place to everyone!",5,"2018-09-20 21:27:35",180,1896,9
"15102371","Sunday afternoon we visited this place with the bunch of foodies to experience their new menu which has been added recently. Small outlet with around 15 people can be accommodated at a time.
Coming to the delicacy,
Classic shakes - Poppy cherry and merry cherry were the two shakes which have tried. Poppy cherry was just like butter popcorn shake was decent. Merry cherry was simply outstanding and loved it.
Premium shakes - Cruncy blue berry & Caramel brownie were my favorites. These are the must tried shakes at this place.
Exclusive shake - Coffee hazlenut and cookie feast were delicious too. Cheesecake was decent nothing that great.
Crushers - Orange bright, Poppy corn, mint cucumber are some of the crushers which we tried but all were ok.
Fries - Peri Peri Fries and Cajun spice fries were really outstanding and loved it.
Potato wedges - this one was decent with Jamaican dips.
Overall there new menu is quite a hit and have some amazing exclusive and premium shake which is not too heavy on the pocket and tasty at the same time. As we were invited here by management for the new menu session but will visit again for sure in future to taste other shakes and delicacies.

"33768081","A Sunday afternoon and desserts, definitely makes an awesome combination added to which I had piri piri flavoured Potato wedges and french fries. All under one roof which makes Temptys different from rest.
I in a group of 8 landed this Sunday afternoon to relish their newly added shakes and flavoured snacks.
We were served with Poppy Corn & Merry Cherry as a part of their classic shakes, Caramel Brownie, Crunchy Blue & Berry, Mint o fruit from their premium shakes, Coffee Hazelnut & Cookie feast from their Exclusive shakes and Minty Cucumber, poppycorn and blue and berry from their slush sections.
The perfect shakes were: Poppy Corn, Caramel Brownie and Crunchy Blue & Berry. Poppy corn just took my heartaway. The perfect aroma of corn and it was an add on to this autumn. Caramel Brownie will definitely be favourites to all the chocolate and brownie lovers. Honestly, blue berry flavoured desserts have become my one of the favourite pick in desserts lately.
These are must trial from here. I have never come across any shake which such an amazing variety flavoured taste.
The snacks behaves cherry on the top with piri piri flavour. Someone once said you eat food first with your eyes then with nose and finally you get to taste it. These snacks surpasses everything. The potato wedges and french fries were crispy and had the exemplary colour.
Worth a visit for their special add ons in the menu.

"1526181","The Caramel Brownie was one of my favorites. The taste of sweet caramel alongwith the brownies was a perfect combination. When there is too much of sweet, you definitely need some savory. So we had some french fries. Although the sauce on top wasn‚Äôt that great the fries were spicy and awesome....Read full post on thegastronomictale.wordpress.com",4,"2018-09-19 11:05:31",NA,1498,0
"4532951","Tempteys recently revamped their menu, and we got a chance to try the additions at their Gachibowli outlet. This outlet is a mere walking distance away from DLF, and easily locatable in the building next to Vijaya Bank.
All their shakes come with the options of 2 bases Gelato (icecream) and Avalanche (yoghurt). Here's a list of the new ones, and how they fared.
Poppy corn: It looks quite plain, but one sip, and you'll be amazed at the smoky flavour of popcorn hitting you from the sweet shake.
Merry cherry and Crunchy Forest Berry are for those who love the berries.
If you're a Mint enthusiast, do try the Mint o Fruit shake.
For those who can't get enough of cookie shakes, Cookie Feast comes in with Oreo and Little Hearts stacked on the top.
Coffee addicts can try the very appealing Coffee Hazelnut, which was absolutely a pretty sight too!
My personal favourite, though, was Caramel Brownie. The flavour of caramel, with chewy chunks of brownie, and a topping of whipped cream üòç heavenly!
Another good one was the Cheese Cake shake. It felt like a fruit cake, blended into a shake, and is good if you enjoy that flavour.
There's a whole set of flavours of slushies as well.
Just in case, it gets too sweet, they have French Fries and Potato Wedges, available in a total of 8 flavours. They come in cute little boxes, that you can probably carry away too! We tried and absolutely loved the Chilli Garlic, Real White cheese, and Cajun Spice flavours.
At 89 bucks, they're quite good to be honest.
Do give them a try whenever you're around!

"31906531","What I love about their shakes are they are not very high in sugar. So sugars don't kill the flavors expected in that shake...!!!
Tried:
poppy corn: Absolutely loved the flavor. You could get a clear flavor of popcorns. Would recommend to try if you love popcorns.
old granola (honey loops) Again amazing. One of the must tries.
berry cherry: Good amount of berries, great flavor. Recommended.
caramel Brownie: This was also pretty good. I am. personally not a caramel flavor lover, so not my fav.
coffee hazel nut: This was just WOW. must have for coffee lovers. They were really generous in putting the coffee in the shake :D. It had a strong coffee flavor. So if you are a true coffee lover you'll like it. ;)
Cheesecake (tuti fruity) : It had exactly tuti fruity flavor. Didn't like it much.
oreo and little hearts (cookie feast): Oreo shake never fails.. :) It was good.
Blueberry slush: I didn't like the slush though. it only seemed to have color but no taste.
Mint o fruit: I don't like mint flavors at all. And was ofc Minty. So not my fav. If you like mint flavors it's for you.
They have different toppings for french fries and potato wedges and they are all just soooo amazing... Must Try.

The variety on the thick shakes is amazing and the every next you try feels better then the previous. I like the concept of putting sticky notes all around the walls with comments they received from the customers. The song collection which they play in background has never disappointed me as well.

Although they have a bit of cramp seating space, yet sometimes the wait is just worth. They make really thick ice-cream shakes which are all worth trying. Naughty nuttela is a recommendation from my side.

I ordered a Coffee Latey Shake [Rs.169] and my friend ordered a Coffee Caramelo Shake [Rs.169]. Both the shakes were really nice and thick. They are made with a blend of lots of ice cream, caramel, coffee and topped with whipping cream.
On my second visit to this place I tried it's Go Guava Shake [Rs.145] and it is my favorite. It tasted awesome with plenty of ice cream blended with guava and topped with Guava crush.epicureantales.com",4,"2018-06-27 09:10:53",443,2461,7

"53379749","Ordered Mango Moon. The taste should have been proportional. It felt more like yoghurt and less mango.
It‚Äôs a problem with any Avanlanche base shake from Tempteys. Otherwise Gelato base shakes have always been good.",4,"2018-06-18 13:40:44",11,2,0
