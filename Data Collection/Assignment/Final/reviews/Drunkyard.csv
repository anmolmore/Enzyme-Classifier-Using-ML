"35139260","A good pace to hangout with friends. Ambience and live music is the plus.
The food was yummy and service prompt.
The main complaint is the reluctant management. A place like drunkyard should showcase sport screenings which would be a real plus but the management was adamant in only showing music videos on mute, didn't make sense. Didn't try to change even after repeated requests.
But all in all a good place for drinks n live music. Tasty starters and food is a good reason to go back. Hope they understand playing sports is better crowd puller than muted video songs.",3,"2019-03-20 21:32:44",7,2,0

"16174233","On a roadside. Very convenient place to drop by. Moderately lit - well ambience can be made better.. never too crowded. Pocket friendly place for drinks.
*No dance floor.
Food was really good, for a place that serves alcohol- though compared to the price of alcohol, food will seem a bit costly.. Outside seating is also available. But that also serves as the smoking zone. So decide before jumping at the decision to take the outdoor seating.
Would like the place to put on some good music and get the wifi working. Since many software employees might end up there in night üò¨
And for the management, please please start accepting PayTm.
So... that's why 4 üåü. Overall, a nice yard to get drunk üòú",4,"2019-02-13 00:23:56",47,143,0

"2977466","A really decent hangout in the Gachibowli area with a good sized restaurant area. I went there on a weekday lunch time to have a beer watching a cricket match. Almost free sans a big office group having biriyanis & beer. They provide 30% off on liquor during happy hours and I was happy to take it.¬†
I just wanted to have a couple of beers watching the cricket match, hence ordered for a Carlsberg strong along with a Paneer Tikka. The Paneer tikka was really awesome and tasted amazing. It had a good quantity too, so I couldn't order more food.¬†
The service was prompt but the time I went, there was absolutely no one else. The open air area had a nice junkyard kinda feel to it with drums & other wooden stuffs converted into chairs & tables. I imagine it will have a good vibe during the evening time when there is a good footfall.",4,"2018-12-24 14:49:57",119,469,3

"29223328","Not one of the fanciest!
The place's ambience goes a little confusing as the decor and the lighting doesn't compliment each other well. Whatever experiment in terms of the aesthetic appeal of the place has been tried; doesn't turn out to be the best. Servers are courteous but can be well trained to enhance the meal experience.
Look forward to a better experience next time!!",4,"2018-09-16 08:22:18",53,272,3

The drinks are decent. The non veg starters are mind blowing, do try chicken salt and pepper. The tandoori chicken is one of the best in town.
The place is well maintained, funky ambience, earlier it was the IPL that attracted the crowd, now football season is on. Service is good.

"1085608","So after a long gap I visited a place to hangout and chill, and came up with an idea to visit Drunkyard. 
So why I gave 3 star - there are some good and bad about this place. 
The ambiance is quite good, food is not. 
Customer service is quite awful which they can fix by giving the guys some basic training. 
Crowd is good. 
You have a nice outdoor space. 
You can have a beer and chill. 
But be ready to get little irritated, food is not what you expect it to be. 
You have to search for the guys to take your order which will make you a bit angry sometime. 
Overall, the place is good for a short span. You can go hangout and chill. 
To the management team of Drunkyard - you are doing a good job in respect to overall beauty but customer service and the food must be your priority. 
Hope to visit this place after some good reviews.",3,"2018-04-05 22:33:45",47,1503,8

The staff was very courteous and extremely elegant.The manager accommodated is even after the drinking hours were closed since we were not aware of It.He was really very helpful in getting us fois and liquor at late night. They suggested us the best starters based on our taste buds and liking. Note worthy mention is chicken charcoal. For vegetarians kebabs area must try.
Drinks were properly served with apt amount of chillness, lemon and sugar. the breads were served hot along with hot n spicy gravy items the way we wanted.

Also, the ambience is quite colorful and unique, with various kinds of perky, crazy illustrations on the walls.
Coming to the food, we ordered starters and some beer along with the main course. In starters, the Crispy Honey Chicken was definitely a great appetizer.
Coming to the main course, we had a mix of Indian and Chinese items. The schezuan chicken and egg fried rice(though being a simple dish), both were really great. Other than that, the other items could have been better.",4,"2017-10-19 23:57:49",12,1540,4

When m friend ask one of the staff to switch on the AC he got one Fan.. After that we have cancelled the order and walk out from that place. The best part is that no one is bother ask us...

"45284221","Sudden plan and we went this place on a Friday night, was a very good decision. Ambiance was good. Doesn't give much of a feel like its name but ya music was superb.. ...
We had some starters which were amazing but the killer was the grilled fish with mashed Stuff potatoes ¬†and sauce. Food is just great, Mediterranean ¬†is a must try which is pizza made on Indian naan gives a mix flavor of Italian seasoning and taste . We had butter chicken in main course and we were happy dint expect a place like that could serve good butter chicken. 
A must go place keep it up guys !!",4.5,"2017-08-23 17:32:58",1,1,0
"2722044","Ambience is good, esp the live music, food is okay. The place is best for drinks and stuff,also the food is good. The environment of the restaurant is the most unique which makes it different and attract most people, great to have a party with your friends as the ambience would add an advantage to it. Over all great.",3.5,"2017-08-17 20:47:49",16,9,0
"30210636","I had a really sweet lovely experience at the restaurant. Weather being windy and cool,i loved it live music.we opted for outdoor seating. And the view is really great. 5 on 5 for the ambiance. In the starters we ordered Drunkyard ¬†special Nonveg Platter: the hara bhara kebab and the BBQ legs were good. Their BBQ ¬†Pizza was luscious. Loved the experieence with an extremely frieendly staff .",4.5,"2017-08-16 18:03:01",1,1,0
"3112496","Ambience is Ok.
Staff mentioned last order is 11.15 and bar and restaurant will be closed at 11.45.
But they have switched off the AC @ 11.15.
Too many mosquitos.
Ordered Sambar rice which costs 180 ‚Çπ. Quantity is very less and tasted below average.",2,"2017-07-31 00:43:23",92,299,0
"15644414","Awesome place to hang out !! The ambience is very much exquisite. Food and drinks are at affordable price menu. 
Definitely a must try folks. 
The cocktail I ordered named Mast Kalandar, was served to me in a labelled test tube which was pretty large. Loved it. ",3.5,"2017-07-24 14:55:16",25,46,1
"16487464","This place had all their photographs up there taken by a photographer and quite well edited. The reality however isn't half of how we see it up there. The service was pretty low grade. They had ice in their beer jug that my friends have ordered. The food was average to bad. The onion rings however stood apart and were great. The pizza and the starters were bland and lacked any flavour. Flat bread and the mains were decent. There's not much to brag about the ambience too. This place could've been a decent pocket friendly casual visit if not for the prices. It doesn't leave any good experience, neither to your eyes, nor to the palate.",2.5,"2017-07-20 17:15:19",9,17,0
"12730731","This place has kind of become our weekend adda. Most Friday evening after office we find ourselves chilling here. Really like the bands playing Hindi songs. Ambiance is decent but don't get fooled by the pics. One place where there is a need for improvement is the limited items in the menu specially for vegetarian people.",3.5,"2017-07-15 22:54:06",18,99,0

Definitely a good place to visit. Liked the atmosphere but it can be better. Service was great. Food was above average with genuine taste without any X factor. Cost is bit on the higher side as compared to other such restaurants",4,"2017-07-05 00:21:23",111,105,3
"43062595","With a unique concept of bar hopping in a bar itself, this place will impress you with its amazing ambiance. They have Three types of seating/ambiance within them: inside seating, stand up bar, amphitheater like set up with projector screen and outdoor seating garden!! 
Drinks : innovative cocktail served in beautiful glasses ! Some of the must try would be Comic shots and whiskey headliners : both whiskey based drinks but refreshing!! 
Food : Served in innovative ways, they have some delicious starters to go with your drinks. Some of the must try would be chicken tikka, cheese balls, Thai basil chicken and onions rings. 
Mains: thin crust pizzas are a must try here. Pasta was well made and had adequate chicken. For health conscious folks, do try their grilled chicken and chicken Ceaser salad. 
Desserts left us in awe and asking for more ! Perfect spl Midnight Beauty which will melt in your mouth and you just can't stop ! 
With good weathet setting in Hyderabad, this place is a must go to destination !!!!",4.5,"2017-06-28 16:28:08",2,1,0

I had ordered grilled chicken n grilled fish. By far the best in mid level pubs around hitech. It was simply wow. Not sure of other cuisines. The food was good. Dont expect much in ambience or crowd.",3.5,"2017-05-27 19:05:47",104,894,2

"982428","Oh my god ! Heights of rudeness. Zero f**ks given to the customer walking out because of their bad attitude. Super rude staff , won't let you choose a place to sit in more than half empty tables. They decide the worst place for you to sit as you arrived early 10 pm & you are just 2 people. So you will be granted a weird place in a corner from where you can't watch ipl final. The most important thing of all this is all happening in a place which is hardly 30% occupied & 70% is reserved in their head ? And we were upset & started walking towards the exit & to our comfort zero fu**ks were given about that as well. ",1,"2017-05-22 01:23:38",3,1,0
"31712636","I wish I could rate in negative. The staff is super rude . They would keep 60% of the table reserved with the prospect of more people coming. Harshly denying you any of the good seats you want. Even on request they don't give a damn & doesn't bother them even if yoh walk out. Pathetic hospitality. Although I'm thankful that they didn't stop me from going as I went to some other awesome warm place üòç",1,"2017-05-21 22:50:21",28,24,0
