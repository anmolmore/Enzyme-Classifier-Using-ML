"31980270","The veg roll I had was one of the better wraps I've had..The service is fast and good.The aloo tikki wrap was really good.The kitchen is clean like a subway ..
Overall a good place near the DLF .A bite when you need one...",3.5,"2016-08-08 19:18:48",20,42,6
"1231476","Had the chicken kati roll..  It was Okieys not so great.  The filling was nice and good in quantity,  but the taste was somehow a lil bland.  As i said a decent taste.  Didn't match up with what i was expecting at this price.  Its a lil over priced i should say considering the quality of food provided..  Do try once.  But not  regularly.

"606352","For a quick bite for evening snacks v ordered chicken kati kebab roll and chicken nuggets. Main disappointing thing was the wrap. It was to hard to chew though the filling was tasty. Nuggets r as usual.",3.5,"2016-04-18 21:08:21",157,218,0
"952747","Ordered the Chinese and spicy combo (chicken). The picking was really good. The French fries were okaish in the menu they mentioned it was masala fries but all they did was add chat masala, the nuggets and fingers were also sprinkled with chat masala which ruined it's taste. Coming to the roll the taste was not good as it had more veggies than chicken and the sauce used was not sufficient as it felt really dry while reading.
Should add a beverage in the combo.",2.5,"2016-03-09 23:18:51",32,112,0
"1925908","Roll Zone is the only Roll point in Gachibowli atleast where I can say that this looks like Kathi Roll. Being from Delhi, no-one can beat that taste but still it is worth trying ;-)",3.5,"2016-03-07 23:58:54",46,89,0
"1882624","Whenever I visit DLF for grabbing a quick bite to eat, I would generally see a huge line queued up in front of the Frankie Kiosk. I always wondered why not pay an additional 30 rupees and have a nice huge Kathi Roll. Kathi roll a street food dish originating from Kolkata, is a skewer roasted kebab wrapped in a paratha. As time progressed we have taken this traditional dish and made many improvises to the same....Read full post on flavouredexpressions.com",3.5,"2016-02-24 14:10:32",NA,716,7
"14329371","Ordered a couple of times through Swiggy. Their rolls are quite filling for a hungry stomach. We have also tried their french fries, chicken nuggets and garlic chicken fingers and so I must say they have loads of ajinomoto (msg) sprinkled on these. I would request you guys to not sprinkle at all or reduce the amount considerably..",2,"2015-11-27 06:50:51",10,46,0
"32365768","Good rolls but not economical. I found it a little expensive for the food. The rolls are good but not amazing and have eaten better rolls compared to this for cheaper ",3.5,"2015-11-03 00:03:35",20,8,0
"888824","Out of my love for shawarmas nd rolls tried this place and was not disappointed. The packing is awesome but about the roll it is okayish. Needs improvement.",2.5,"2015-10-22 15:38:21",45,175,0
"31306363","Utter nonsense!! They come up with all stupid reasons out of unavailability. Out of my love for rolls n Frankie's I've tried to order from them a couple of times and was furious on them after listening to their weird excuses. The combos they provide in menu are almost unavailable, so is the state with the starters.
Hope zomato puts an option to rate negatively!!",1,"2015-09-18 12:32:59",44,78,0
"1366361","Just another roll joint. Nothing much to write home about.
Have ordered from here once or twice and was disappointed by the quality. 
The packing and presentation are a thumbs up but they can only go so far , its the quality that matters and the quality is not up to the mark.
With Faaso's coming to Hyderabad these guys should buckle up.

"2042298","For those of us who hail from Kolkata, the idea of paying close to 100 bucks for a roll is, frankly, a tad appalling. But then we love rolls so much, we're willing to pay the price for it. Literally.
The rolls on offer here are the perfect snack. And for some, maybe even good enough to serve as dinner. The parathas used are soft, though a little thin. The stuffing is generous. And the taste overall is pretty decent.
If you're in the locality and happen to be up for a snack, then this place is definitely worth trying out.",4,"2015-08-07 01:23:29",14,112,0
"2725096","Tried the Egg Chicken tava fried roll. Plenty of filling and the chicken was sauted with freshly cut onions and served in a kfc wrap fashion..
Good and moderately spicy with the base not very thick.price 80 rs
The arabian grape juice was average...price 30 rs",4,"2015-08-06 20:02:16",82,752,0
"30416441","I love kathi rolls and I am coming to this place on weekends more than I should. I specially love their chicken tikka roll. They serve a dollop of herbal chutney which goes hand in hand with the rolls and the rolls are wrapped into a tidy package.",4.5,"2015-07-06 17:26:16",119,492,0
"132958","Roll Zone opened recently opposite DLF, a kiosk which has changed from a South Indian tiffin center to a maggi place & now serving kathi rolls.
Got takeaway once & home delivery couple of times and was a good experience each time. Aloo Tikki, Egg n Cheese & Chilli Paneer are the pick of the lot. Fresh & well-spiced filling with the right amount of onions & sauces. Surprisingly, the former two come wrapped in maida roti but latter in a flaky paratha. Cheesy nuggets & potato wedges are average (frozen ones fried on demand)
Best thing is their packaging, rolls are wrapped in oil paper & put in a box having perforated tearaway grooves. Quite simple & non-messy. Plus it's microwaveable which means one can enjoy them hot.
Drawback is the location & hygiene - that side of DLF Street scene has an overflowing drain problem nearly always. Hence my propensity for takeaway/delivery.
Pricing is slightly higher than the other Kolkata Roll places but with good packaging & free home delivery, this place comes up trumps for hot n delicious Kathi Rolls.",4,"2015-06-07 14:15:52",166,459,1
