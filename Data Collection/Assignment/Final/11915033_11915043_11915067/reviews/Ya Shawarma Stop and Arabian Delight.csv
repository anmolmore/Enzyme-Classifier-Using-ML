"55159068","Ordered 1 cheese chicken shawarma and 1 regular chicken shawarma. Shawarmas are tasty no doubt in that. But cheese shawarma didn't have cheese in it, atleast I could see the difference. Regular shawarma had way too many onions and cucumber pieces. Even chicken quantity was less in both of them.
I am giving 4 star just on the basis of shawarma's taste. Otherwise other factors just deserve 2-3 stars.",4,"2018-06-26 22:44:16",9,0,0
